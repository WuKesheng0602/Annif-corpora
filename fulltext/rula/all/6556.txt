Service Delivery to Informal Settlements in South Asia's Mega Cities, the Role of State and NonState  Actors, Ph.D., 2017, Faisal Haq Shaheen, Policy Studies, Ryerson University   

Abstract
This  interdisciplinary  research  project  compares  service  delivery  outcomes  to  informal  settlements  in  South  Asia's  largest  urban  centres:  Dhaka,  Karachi  and  Mumbai.  These  mega  cities  have  been  overwhelmed by increasing demands on limited service delivery capacity as growing clusters of informal  settlements,  home  to  significant  numbers  of  informal  sector  workers,  struggle  to  obtain  basic  services.  In  the  absence  of  state  supports,  some  informal  settlements  engage  nonstate  actors  to  obtain  services.  In  order  to  compare  service  delivery  outcomes  through  these  actors,  I  used  a  layered,  mixed  methods  approach  guided  by  an  interdisciplinary  literature  review  and  policy  examination.  I  drew  on  semi structured  interviews  as  well  as  pairs  of  case  studies  to  measure  successful  and  unsuccessful  service  delivery outcomes in each of the three mega cities.   Key  findings  are  that  chronic  disconnections  exists  in  all  three  countries,  where  upper  tiers  of  the  state  persistently  fail  to  create  an  enabling  environment  for  lower  tier  state  actors  and  municipal  service  delivery  machinery.  The  cause  of  these  disconnections  is  the  persistent  colonial  impression  on  the  bureaucracy,  Neoliberal  policies  and  the  appropriation  of  public  resources  by  organized  crime  and  their  backers, urban elites. Nonstate actors have facilitated service delivery to informal settlements, resulting  in isolated success and improved levels of human development. However, the case studies demonstrate  that  the  success  of  nonstate  actors  is  attributed  to  support  from  lower  tier  state  actors.  A  complex  political  economy  of  upper  and  lower  tier  actors,  rooted  in  unresolved  land  ownership  and  elite  interests is disabling the capabilities of lower tier state actors to extend services to the urban poor.  The  study  informs  our  understanding  of  the  role  played  by  technical  nongovernmental  organizations  (NGOs) in facilitating representative communitybased organizations (CBOs) engagement of state service  delivery  providers.  The  study  illustrates  the  differential  attitudes  between  upper  and  lower  tier  state  actors  towards  informal  settlements.  The  study  also  separates  the  `development  industry'  from  grass  root  representatives  of  informal  settlements.  The  study  also  affirms  the  ability  of  informal  settlements  to organize, mobilize and engage municipal service delivery providers. The study emphasizes the need to  remove  constraints  that  upper  tiers  of  state  and  society  place  on  informal  settlements  in  order  for  equitable development and sustainable levels of service delivery to be realized.  iii

1 Introduction
Prior  to  discussing  my  research  focus  on  informal  settlements  in  South  Asia,  it  will  be  helpful  to  identify  two  phenomena,  a  historical  and  contemporary  one,  that  have  contributed  to  the  proliferation  of  informal  settlements  and  the  rapid  increase  of  the  informal  sector  across  the  Global  South.  The  most  obvious  one  is  the  impact  of  the  legacy  of  colonialism  while  the  more  subtle  involves  the  spread  of  neoliberalism.  These  phenomena  have  created  deep  and  permanent  imprints  across  South  Asia's  urban  landscape.  Colonialism  has  had  irreversible  impacts  on  political  arrangements,  bureaucratic  infrastructure,  social  relations,  administrative  instruments,  urban  planning  and  patterns  of  wealth  distribution.  During  the  precolonial  period,  a  system  of  privilege  dispensation  encouraged  the  circulation  of  resources  between  rural  and  urban  economies.  For  instance,  the  Mansabdari  system  under  the  Mughals  in  precolonial  India  established  their  territorial  authority  as  superior  rightholders  though  a  mechanism  of  tribute  collection  from  rural  producers  (Aziz,  1972).  While  this  system  enabled  the  exploitation  of  agrarian  producers,  peasants  and  small  farmers,  it  allowed  for  tribute  rates  to  be  adjusted  during  arid  seasons.  This  alleviated  financial  pressure  from  rural  economies  during  periods  of  poor  crop  performance.  It  also  enabled  the  emergence  of  an  urban  society  with  niches  for  artists,  entertainers and other servants to the wealthy nobility (AminKhan, 2012).     In  contrast,  once  the  British  colonizers  imposed  the  English  fief  in  colonial  India,  they  dismantled  the  elaborate  system  of  Mughalera  superior  right  holders,  thereby  denying  the  sustenance  of  the  artistic  class,  and  facilitated  the  destruction  of  the  emerging  urban  society.  Furthermore,  British  colonizers  made  no  allowance  for  leaving  agrarian  lands  fallow  thereby  permitting  their  regeneration  Â­  a  practice  followed by the Mughals.   The aims of British colonial rulers were to extract as much surplus as possible  from  rural  society.  During  the  first  25  years  of  colonization,  they  quadrupled  the  quantum  of  tribute  collection  paid  by  the  rural  poor  to  the  colonial  rulers  (Alavi,  H.,  1989).  There  is  no  question  regarding  the  overbearing  conditions  for  the  peasantry  under  the  Mughals.  However,  the  conditions  for  the 

1   

peasantry  and  poor  farmers  became  far  more  oppressive,  disruptive  and  onerous  under  colonial  rule1.   The  organic  and  symbiotic  development  of  rural  and  urban  economies  that  was  underway  with  the  Mughals  ended  abruptly  and  violently  once  colonial  rule  was  established  Â­  a  consequence  that  continues  in  the  decolonized  context.  This  is  due  to  the  legacy  of  social  relations  established  under  colonialism  which,  at  many  levels  of  state  and  society  in  present  South  Asia,  appears  to  have  been  preserved.    Based  on  this  brief  sketch  of  the  colonial  legacy  in  South  Asia  and  in  terms  of  my  comparative  study,  I  am  suggesting  that  although  social  relations  in  the  three  South  Asian  states  of  Bangladesh,  India  and  Pakistan  have  been  adversely  impacted  by  this  legacy,  it  manifests  in  different  ways across these three states, specifically across large urban settings.      In  addition  to  the  impact  of  the  colonial  legacy,  neoliberalism  has  enabled  the  incredible  growth  of  informal  settlements  and  the  informal  sector.  For  instance,  the  number  of  slum  dwellers  is  growing  globally  by  10%  per  annum  (UN  Habitat,  2011).  Although  this  phenomenon  has  had  implications  for  globalization  and  urbanization,  its  impact  has  been  noticeably  different  between  developed  and  developing  countries.  South  Asia  has  the  highest  concentration  of  informal  sector  workers  in  the  world  based  on  nonagricultural  employment.  Informal  settlements  make  up  a  considerable  proportion  of  the  urban  landscape  in  South  Asia:  on  average,  55.5%  (Bangladesh),  84.7%  (India),  and  73.6%  (Pakistan)  of  the  respective  urban  populations  reside  in  slums  and/or  lowincome  areas  (Davis,  2006).  Over  40%  of  the  population  of  cities  in  South  Asia  are  employed  in  the  informal  sector  (UN  Habitat,  2003).  The  promotion  of  privatization,  deregulation  and  economic  liberalization  became  known  as  neoliberalism  in  the  early  1980s  Â­  with  the  dismantling  of  the  public  sector  in  Britain,  the  US  and  Germany  under  Margaret  Thatcher,  Ronald  Regan  and  Helmut  Kohl  respectively.  While  the  public  sectors  of  developed  states were only now being given their first taste of the 'right turn' based on an ideological shift in social  and  economic  policies,  a  form  of  neoliberalism  had  already  been  implemented  in  the  global  South  since  the mid1970s by the Bretton Woods Institutions (led by the IMF with support of the World Bank) in the

 By comparing the treatment of the peasantry under colonial rule to the conditions of Mughal times by no means suggests a return to previous  systems of tribute collection. The comparison is meant to illustrate how conditions for the working poor deteriorated and the pattern of social  and economic polarization is intensified under colonial rule.  As I will return to later in the chapter, the forces which underpin and perpetuate  social polarization and economic inequity persist to this day.

form  of  `conditionalities'  on  loans  (later,  as  structural  adjustment  programs  Â­  SAPs).  These  policy  impositions  (continued  through  the  GATTWTO)  have  had  serious  consequences  for  the  rural  poor  as  SAPinitiated  displacement  and  market  liberalization  exacerbated  patterns  of  urbanization  already  underway, by extending the colonialera divide between rural and urban into the present. At this point it  should be noted that the majority of research has focussed on the impact of neoliberalism at the level of  the  nation  state.  There  is  an  under  representation  of  research  on  the  impacts  of  colonialism  and  neoliberalism on municipal and urban settings, as we will discuss next.    Neoliberalism  has  unleashed  the  profit  taking  interests  of  transnational  corporations  (TNCs)  which  operate  freely  across  international  borders  and  economic  systems.  These  powerful  economic  actors  bypass  the  economic  sovereignty  of  nation  states  and  collaborate  with  internal  elites  across  the  global  South  reorganizing  state  and  society.  Their  presence  has  been  felt  in  urban  centers  where  their  corporate  offices,  industrial  activities,  dominant  supply  chains,  patterns  of  production  and  investment  behaviours  have  crowded  out  domestic  industry  (consisting  of  diverse  and  sophisticated  networks  of  small  and  medium  enterprises).  The  interventions  of  TNCs  have  also  been  felt  in  state  policy  circles,  as  their corporate interests have eclipsed other social and development related priorities. The convergence  of  these  internal  and  external  forces  across  the  global  South  in  the  era  of  neoliberalism  has  intensified  market liberalization, privatization, urbanization and export led growth.     The resurgence of neoliberalism emerged from the economic failures and stagnation of 1970s Keynesian  economic  policies.  The  rise  of  the  Chicago  school  and  the  spread  of  market  based  ideas  resulted  in  the  creation  of  a  new  international  division  of  labour  where  the  deindustrialization  of  the  Global  North  led  to  the  transferring  of  labourintensive  operations  to  the  Global  South,  especially  in  urban  centers  Capitalism  spread  as  the  displacement  of  labour  across  the  Global  South  provided  low  wage  labour  for  export  led  growth.  This  resulted  in  an   increase  in  informal  sector  work  and  sweat  shop  activity  as  trade  liberalization  measures  (imposed  by  the  GATTWTO)  required  developing  countries  to  deregulate,  suspend  labour  laws  and  create  export  processing  zones  that  would  attract  TNCs  and  'crowd  in'  economic  activity.  The  result  has  been  the  growth  of  informal  sector  labour  in  urban  centers  and  the  spread  of  informality,  where  low  wages,  the  absence  of  benefits  and  recognition  of  worker  needs  and  rights  marginalizes  their  development.  At  the  same  time,  subsidies  to  the  poorest  sections  of  the  population  were  removed  in  much  of  the  global  South  as  result  of  SAPs  and  other  neoliberal  measures.   3   

These  developments,  promoted  by  the  WTO,  accompanied  and  reinforced  the  aims  of  structural  adjustment  policies  of  the  IMF  and  WB.  In  this  way,  neoliberalism  was  superimposed  on  the  legacy  of  colonialism,  where  the  displacement  resulting  from  colonialism  created  the  conditions  by  which  neoliberalism could be entrenched across the urban centers of the global South.     The  simultaneous  spread  of  informality  and  the  growth  of  informal  settlements  since  the  1970s  is  evidence  of  the  tremendous  exploitation  of  informal  sector  workers  by  capitalists  and  neoliberalism  influenced  state  policies.  In  many  OECD  countries,  informal  employment  accounts  for  over  half  of  non agricultural  employment.  In  regions  such  as  Sub  Sahara  Africa  and  South  Asia,  the  numbers  are  as  high  as 80% (OECD, 2009). The resilience of informal settlements is the result of the urban poor and informal  sector  workers  struggling  to  eke  out  an  existence  in  order  to  meet  their  most  basic  of  needs.  For  example,  the  number  of  slum  settlements  in  Dhaka  has  doubled  from  just  over  2,000  in  1993  to  nearly  5,000  in  2005  (CUS,  2006).  It  is  also  the  result  of  insufficient  planning  by  state  authorities  to  address  their needs and plan for future requirements  (given  the unending stream of rural to urban  migration). It  also  illustrates  patterns  of  uneven  development,  a  wellknown  consequence  of  capitalism.  Another  consequence in the South Asian context  displacement from mechanization and land concentration  is  a  result  of  capitalist  development  extending  into  the  agrarian  sector.  Urban  population  growth  in  Bangladesh,  India  and  Pakistan  from  2007  to  2015  outpaced  total  population  growth  by  nearly  30  times  (World Development Indicators, 2015).  The  displaced village workers, because they have nowhere  to go  within  the  agrarian  setting,  are  forced  to  migrate  to  urban  centres  only  to  become  part  of  the  informal  sector.  In  India,  an  estimated  93  per  cent  of  the  workforce  is  employed  in  the  informal  sector.2  In  Bangladesh,  the  proportion  of  workers  in  informal  employment  rose  from  76.2  per  cent  in  199900  to  87.5  per  cent  in  2010  and  contribute  to  30  per  cent  of  GDP  (ILO,  2015).  In  Pakistan,  the  proportion  of  workers  in  informal  employment  rose  from  63.8  per  cent  in  2001Â­  02  to  73.3  per  cent  in  2012Â­13  (ILO,  2014).  In  both  countries,  over  40%  of  women  workers  are  unpaid  contributing  family  workers  as  compared  to  only  11%  of  men  (United  Nations,  2005).  Once  they  are  absorbed  by  the  informal  sector,

 The informal sector in these studies encompasses informal sector labor that is employed as entrepreneurs and standalone proprietorships as  well as informal labor which are employed by the formal sector in poor conditions.

they  become  a  reservoir  of  flexible  and  inexpensive  supply  of  lowwage  labour.  This  captive  pool  of  unemployed  labour  ensures  that  continued  lowcost  production  and  substantial  surpluses  can  continue  to  be  extracted.  An  estimated  57  per  cent  of  India's  urban  labourers  earn  wages  below  the  nationally  stated  minimum  and  are  subject  to  working  hours  that  exceed   the  average  eight  hours  as  outlined  by  labour laws, and work conditions and environments are often appalling (MukherjeeReid, 2010).    Neoliberalism  has  permitted  and  in  fact  encouraged  industrialization  and  the  mechanization  of  agriculture, which have all contributed to the displacement of people from rural communities Â­ reducing  them to unemployed rural workers who have no alternative other than to migrate to urban centres. It is  therefore  not  surprising  that  these  displaced  workers  have  taken  up  building  rudimentary  residences  in  clusters of informal settlements near export development zones and urban free trade areas. I will return  to the relationship between displaced labour and neoliberalism later (please see section 2.4.2 for a more  comprehensive  discussion).  One  can  appreciate  that  in  the  absence  of  sufficient  housing  and  service  delivery  planning,  informal  settlements  have  ballooned  across  the  region.  As  existing  service  delivery  machinery has been overwhelmed, market forces and private industry have captured  the policy agenda.  For  example,  municipal  planning  is  driven  more  by  myopic  developer  led  agendas  than  broader  community  based  consultations  and  needs.  As  a  result,  capitalists  have  been  able  to  push  through  large  resourceintensive  projects  that  cater  to  the  profittaking  interests  of  elites  while  neglecting  the  needs  of  the  informal  sector.  The  result  has  been  the  establishment  of  enclaves  of  wealthy  elites  and  the  spread  of  informal  settlements.  Although  the  regions'  economies  continue  to  benefit  from  lowwage  labour,  the  benefits  have  not  moved  down  to  the  poor  while  the  state  has  continued  to  neglect  the  human  development  needs  of  the  informal  sector.  The  absence  of  basic  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements  reflects  the  development  disparities  across  the  regions'  urban  centers.  The  gap  in  human  development  indicators  between  upper  and  lowerincome  groups  has  widened  in  recent  years,  and  informal settlements are proliferating in many large cities in Latin America, Africa, and Asia.  

1.1 Research Focus
The  exploding  rate  of  labour  markets  and  `informality'  in  the  developing  world  presents  numerous  challenges  for  urban  policymakers  and  service  delivery  providers.  Although  I  will  expand  on  these  dynamics  later,  it  is  important  to  recognize  the  impact  of  the  spread  of  informal  settlements.  My  research  focusses  on  the  policy  challenges  facing  informal  settlements  in  three  of  South  Asia's  mega  cities  and  the  implications  for  service  delivery.  These  mega  cities  are  complex  sites  of  production  where  5   

capitalists extract substantial surpluses from a fragmented labour pool. The weak and yet swelling ranks  of  this  labour  pool  are  the  result  of  urbanization  and  is  closely  tied  to  the  region's  struggles  with  its  colonial  legacy.  The  well  planned  and  serviced  enclaves  of  the  ruling  elite  are  in  stark  contrast  to  the  squalor  of  poorly  built  homes.  The  absence  of  sanitation  and  other  basic  services  has  permitted  the  spread of disease and poor health. Nevertheless, market facing policies coupled with the  mechanization  of  agriculture  and  industrialization  of  cities  have  attracted  more  informal  labour.  Rising  levels  of  social  and  economic  inequality  have  been  left  unchecked.  The  result  has  been  informality  and  the  further  marginalization of an unprotected labour pool participating in the informal sector.   Many  urban  policy  commentators  argue  that  the  solution  lies  in  privatizing  urban  services,  pursuing  marketled development, and embracing neoliberal policy prescriptions. I argue that in reality, it is these  very  policies  of  marketorientation  that  entrench  the  interests  of  elites  in  the  formal  sector  while  constraining  the  formalization  of  the  informal  sector  Â­  without  problematizing  neoliberalism  or  the  legacy of colonialism that remains ossified in the postcolonial state. As development lobbies, real estate  brokers  and  other  elites  battle  over  claims  and  tenure  to  public  and  private  lands,  weak  policy  frameworks  (such  as  failed  land  reforms)  and  institutional  structures  are  exposed  to  graft,  corruption  and  exploitation.  The  various  layers  of  the  bureaucracy,  previously  beholden  to  colonial  elites,  are  now  influenced  by  local  elites  and  cater  to  their  interests.  Over  time,  influential  state  actors  form  alliances  with  elites  to  appropriate  public  lands,  goods  and  resources  for  their  own  gain.  The  result  of  which,  is  widespread corruption as upper tier state actors tied to organized crime groups (who appropriate public  land  and  public  water)  exploit  informal  settlements  through  the  extraction  of  rents  while  denying  residents of basic services. Before I continue, let me expand upon my use of the terms, upper and lower  tier  state  actors,  a  distinction  in  the  postcolonial  context  that  has  its  roots  in  the  structure  of  the  colonial state's bureaucracy in South Asia.    Across  the  policy  literatures,  assumptions  persist  regarding  the  applicability  of  Eurocentric  approaches  to developing country administrations. Policy research, for example, focusses on increasing engagement 

6   

between  the  political  leadership  and  the  public,3  while  ignoring  the  hierarchical  nature  of  the  bureaucracy,  especially  in  the  postcolonial  context.   This  theoretical  position,  ignores  the  hierarchical  structure  and  dynamics  of  South  Asia's  state  machinery,  which  bears  a  heavy  imprint  of  the  colonial  state  structure  that  was  in  the  service  of  the  British  colonial  occupation  of  India.  The    impact  of  this  legacy  meant  that  the  colonial  state's  hierarchical  structure,  reimposed  in  the  postcolonial  era,  was  effectively a recreation of a class of higher level4 bureaucrats (considered worthy of engaging the ruling  class) who were educated and groomed to cater to  elite interests through the creation of closed circuits  of social and political engagements.  Lower echelons5 of the bureaucracy (more representative of society  as  a  whole)  were  left  with  limited  opportunities  for  education,  development  or  decisionmaking  power  as compared to their superiors.  Furthermore, while members of higher levels of the civil service are well  respected  and  their  positions  at  the  federal  and  provincial  levels  considered  prestigious,  lower  level  posts  within  the  provincial  (specifically  those  that  engage  the  IS)  and  municipal  levels  are  often  perceived as 'punishment positions' and remain underequipped and less developed in their capacity for  service  delivery  (Shaheen,  2009).  The  intergovernmental  fault  lines  created  by  colonialism,  prompt  me  to  highlight  the  divide  by  examining  the  postcolonial  state  within  the  context  of  the  bureaucracy's  upper and lower tiers.   It  is  within  this  policy  and  political  and  economic  framework,  my  dissertation  explores  the  challenges  to  water  and  sanitation  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements  in  South  Asia's  largest  mega  cities:  Dhaka,  Karachi,  and  Mumbai.  I  analyze  the  roles  and  differential  attitudes  of  different  state  and  nonstate  actors  involved  in  extending  and  sustaining  services.  I  also  examine  how,  despite  a  disabling  policy  context,  members  of  the  urban  informal  sector  engage  civil  society  organizations  in  an  effort  to  self organize.  Once  mobilized,  informal  sector  labourers,  many  of  whom  reside  in  informal  settlements,  are  able to leverage local knowledge and obtain services from the state.

 It should be mentioned that many of the solutions accept the reality of foreign involvement and the introduction of governance models that  rely increasingly on the transfer of state responsibilities to the private sector.  4  This upper tier of bureaucrats and politicians, are largely employed within the federal and provincial levels of government.  These positions  are largely prestigious and do not actively engage society or the IS.    5  The lower tier of bureaucrats and politicians, are largely employed within the provincial and municipal levels of the government.  These  positions are occupied by more front line civil servants and are nested within IS communities.

The  literature  on  informality  consists  of  interdisciplinary  contributions  that  link  neoliberal  forces  with  the  informal  sector  and  informal  settlements.  I  unpack  the  role  of  market  forces  (stemming  from  neoliberalism)  in  my  examination  of  the  displacement  of  rural  labour  and  their  continued  migration  to  urban  settings.  Urban  markets  and  industrial  settings  benefit  from  the  supply  of  low  wage  labour  and  the  surplus  available  to  profit  taking  enterprise.  For  instance,  private  sector  led  'development'  projects  utilize this low wage labour pool (during construction of highways and other formal infrastructure) while  excluding  them  from  the  decision  making  (informal  settlements  are  levelled  to  make  room  for  highway  corridors). Now, this dissertation is not meant to offer a comprehensive critical analysis of neoliberalism  per  se  or  of  capitalist  development  in  the  global  South  in  the  period  of  neoliberalism.  Therefore,  I  will  restrict  this  part  of  the  introduction  to  outlining  the  key  terms  relevant  to  my  research  and  analysis:  informality,  informal  settlements  and  informal  sector  work.  I  will  discuss  these  terms  more  fully  in  section 1.3.1.   I  view  `informality'  as  the  consequence  of  rural  migrant  displacement,  industrialization,  mechanization  of  agriculture  and  most  of  all  the  failure  of  urban  governments  and  society  to  absorb  the  inflow  of  displaced  labour  from  rural  areas,  and  recognize  their  contribution  to  the  urban  economy.  Informality  contributes  to  enlarging  the  life  chances  of  poor  and  lowpaid  workers  of  the  formal  sector  who  rely  on  lowcost  goods  and  services  from  the  informal  sector.   Informality  defines  the  existence  of  people  who  work  in  the  informal  sector,  outside  the  realm  of  the  formal  capitalist  economy  and  purview  of  state sanctioned  services,  government  protection  or  the  enforcement  of  labour  laws,  social  cover  and  security.  Many  of  these  informal  sector  workers  live  in  informal  settlements  that  are  considered  "irregular"  and  "illegal"  by  the  state.  The  enormous  human  toll  of  informality  is  visible  in  the  condition  of  informal  settlements.  These  settlements  start  as  largely  rudimentary  makeshift  arrangement  that  displaced people cobble together for basic shelter and survival, which then take on a life of their own as  the  state  in  South  Asia,  and  the  global  South  more  generally,  remains  aloof  and  indifferent  to  the  needs  and wellbeing of communities impacted by rural displacement. This indifference of the state leads to the  rise  of  informality  at  one  level  and,  at  another,  makes  available  a  very  large  body  of  unemployed  workers  that  are  willing  to  work  for  depressed  wages  in  order  to  subsist.  Because  this  pool  of  labour  is  being  regularly  replenished  by  future  rural  displacements,  it  becomes  captive  to  the  exploitive  impulse  of  capitalists  and  downward  pressure  on  wages.  Consequently,  informality  becomes  a  concomitant  part  of capitalist development, and informal sector workers as ready and exploitable reserve for the needs of  capital.   Although  informality  is  marked  by  destitution,  poverty,  oppression  and  exploitation,  people  in  8   

informal  settlements  Â­  by  their  sheer  determination,  grit  and  creativity  Â­  manage  to  use  their  creativity  and  ingenuity  to  create  as  dignified  an  existence  as  is  conceivable  under  very  challenging  and  troubling  circumstances6.  My  case  studies  below  will  provide  the  reader  with  some  sense  of  the  challenges  posed  by  informality,  and  how  some  of  these  have  been  mitigated  by  the  activities  of  those  who  reside  in  informal settlements.    The  `informal  sector'  is  the  ballooning  pool  of  displaced  rural  migrants  struggling  to  survive  in  urban  centres.  The  ranks  of  the  informal  sector  have  swelled  as  a  result  of  continued  ruraltourban  migration  and neoliberalismtriggered displacement. This group of largely `familyrun operations' functions outside  of government regulations and remains unrecognized by the state. Many of these operations begin with  individual  migrant  workers  leveraging  whatever  skills  they  have  to  carve  out  an  economic  niche  for  themselves within the urban economy. The absence of state engagement (such as documents linking the  individual  to  a  formal  address)  excludes  them  from  services  and  forces  them  into  the  informal  sector.  Many  of  them  start  off  as  food  vendors,  cobblers,  waste  collectors,  day  labourers  and  transportation  operators.  Over  time,  informal  sector  workers  may  find  jobs  as  house  servants,  garment  workers  or  rickshaw  drivers.  The  more  entrepreneurial  among  them  will  start  small  cottage  industries  (shops,  recycling  depots)  supplying  goods  and  services  to  small  and  medium  enterprises.  The  patterns  of  informal  sector  employment  have  been  fuelled  by  Neoliberalism  and  the  low  wage  comparative  advantage  sustained  by  local  industry.  In  order  to  remain  competitive,  local  industries  contract  out  work, suppress wage rates, and reduce formal sector work (AminKhan, 2012). My primary research and  case studies in particular, illustrate how the development costs of neoliberalism have been borne largely  by  members  of  the  informal  sector  who  are  unemployed,  underemployed,  or  engaged  in  precarious  work.  For  a  fuller  discussion  of  the  relationship  between  the  informal  sector  and  neoliberalism,  please  see section 2.4.2.  The diversity of economic niches that are carved out by the informal sector, is paralleled by the range of  improvised  shelters  and  complexity  of  communities  which  they  inhabit.  In  the  absence  of  sufficient

 Ideas for the explanation of informality are from Tariq AminKhan, "Rural Social Relations and the Disruption of the RuralUrban Dialectic in  PostColonial Societies." Unpublished paper presented at the XIV Congress of Rural Sociology, August 1014, 2016, Ryerson University, Toronto

levels  of  affordable  tenements,  informal  sector  workers  will  occupy  any  and  all  available  public  and/or  private  spaces  where  they  can  rest  between  periods  of  work.  In  the  most  'impermanent'  of  conditions,  informal  sector  workers  are  pavement  dwellers,  sleeping  on  the  streets,  sidewalks  and  alleyways  near  places  of  employment.  Although  this  reduces  their  costs  of  habitation  and  transport  it  increases  risks  to  their personal security and permits their employers to dictate their availability, suppress their wages and  marginalize their rights even further. Given the spatial dispersal of this group of informal sector workers,  it is difficult to study and even engage them holistically. At the more 'permanent' end of settlements are  those  informal  sector  labourers  who  reside  in  temporary  or  semi  temporary  housing,  often  referred  to  as  shanties,  slums  or  more  broadly,  informal  settlements.  These  informal  settlements,  or  communities  of  shelter  are  generally  not  recognized  by  the  state  but  are  the  most  practical  sites  from  which  service  delivery  to  the  informal  sector  can  be  both  extended  and  studied:  at  these  sites,  one  can  explore  and  analyze  interactions  between  nonstate  actors  (NGOs  and  CBOs,  which  support  the  informal  sector)  and  state  service  delivery  providers  (underfunded  lower  tier  state  actors)  as  they  engage  or  disengage  the  members  of  the  informal  sector.  For  example,  nonstate  actors  such  as  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs  and  CBOs)  are  mobilizing  representatives  of  the  informal  sector  to  selforganize  as  community based  organizations  (CBOs).  These  CBOs  are  mobilizing  the  informal  sector  to  advocate  for  themselves  and facilitate some basic levels of service delivery from lower tier state actors. Although I will return to a  more  specific  discussion  of  these  interactions  later  (refer  to  2.3.1  for  a  discussion  of  nonstate  actors),  the  centrality  of  the  informal  settlements  context  to  the  human  development  of  the  informal  sector  must be recognized. My case studies will profile them as sites of service delivery.  My research approach  is  unique  in  that  it  unpacks  relationships  between  the  different  tiers  of  the  state  in  relation  to  the  informal  sector.  In  the  following  sections,  I  examine  in  more  detail,  the  relationships  between  the  informal  sector,  nonstate  actors,  and  their  interactions  with  upper  and  lower  tiers  of  the  postcolonial  state  as  part  of  service  delivery  efforts.  Let  us  now  turn  to  the  research  problem  as  framed  by  colonialism and neoliberalism. 

1.2 Research Problem
Colonialera policies  are  one  of  the  more  significant  structural  impediments  behind  the  continued  social  and  economic  polarization  of  South  Asia's  mega  cities.  Part  of  this  colonial  legacy  began  with  the  sharp  segregation  between  `elite  ruler'  and  `native  administrator.'  (Siddiqui  et  al,  1998).  Most  researchers  agree  that  colonialism  created  a  pliant  elitist  upper  tier  of  state  actors  as  part  of  its  empirebuilding  10   

goals  of  resource  extraction,  tribute  collection,  control,  and  profit  maximization.  The  new,  post independence  `native  elites'  continued  their  dependency  on  the  new  postWorld  War  II  imperial  power,  the  US  and  embraced  development  models  supported  by  the  Green  Revolution  and  mechanization  of  agriculture,  which  drove  ruraltourban  migration  as  farm  labourers  continued  to  be  displaced  by  the  introduction  and  expansion  of  technology.  These  elite  policymakers  also  adopted  Westerninfluenced  importbased  industrialization  (instead  of  import  substitution),  urban  manufacturing,  and  exportled  development  zones  as  a  means  of  facilitating  state  restructuring  which,  in  the  absence  of  meaningful  rural  development  policy,  has  resulted  in  the  informal  sector  being  further  marginalized.  Although  this  may  appear  to  lay  almost  exclusively  the  blame  on  external  actors  for  persistent  social  and  economic  disparities  in  South  Asia's  urban  centers,  I  argue  that  internal  factors  are  also  at  play.  Specifically,  I  maintain  that  upper  tier  state  actors  have  continued  to  adopt  neoliberal  thinking  Â­  originally  promoted  by  the  IMF  and  the  World  Bank  Â­  by  facilitating  economic  globalization  and  opening  markets  to  foreign  investment,  and  transnational  corporations  based   on  establishing  free  trade  zones.  Critical  researchers  generally  agree  that  the  gains  made  (by  elites)  from  neoliberal  policies,  now  via  the  GATTWTO,  have  been  at  the  expense  and  exploitation  of  the  informal  sector  (Davis,  2006).  I  argue  that  the  alignment  between  foreign  interests  and  these  upper  tier  state  actors  has  created  the  conditions  for  continued  inequitable development and marginalization of the informal sector.   The  iron  cage  that  allowed  the  upper  tier  of  the  state  to  retain  decisionmaking  power  have  had  disastrous  effects  on  urban  planning  and  municipal  service  delivery.  Marketoriented  neoliberal  policies  transposed on colonialera frameworks have further polarized the relationships between different levels  of  government.  Over  time,  a  dichotomy  has  emerged  between  upper  and  lower  tiers  of  the  state,  reflected  by  a  `differential  attitude'  expressed  as  a  willingness  (or  lack  thereof)  to  engage  informal  settlements.  For  example,  upper  tiers  are  often  accused  of  `policy  formalism,'  which  results  in  badly  designed  `pro  poor'  policies  and  insufficient  funding  of  implementation  machinery  (Farazmand,  2009).  The  majority  of  national  poverty  reduction  programs  have  failed  due  to  their  distance  from  urban  decisionmakers  and  complex  servicedelivery  contexts.  At  the  municipal  level,  little  evidence  from  the  urban  literature  points  to  much  impact  from  nationallevel  policies  on  the  whole.  In  reality,  lower  tier  departments  ranging  from  healthcare  providers  and  educational  institutions  to  public  works  departments  have  all  suffered  from  neglect,  political  interference,  and  dwindling  resources.  The  limited  resources that have been transferred have only ensured that services are provided to the wealthy upper  classes  of  society.  In  my  interviews,  many  frontline  bureaucrats  (lower  tier  state  actors)  and  11   

functionaries  complained  that  their  roles  have  been  reduced  to  serving  as  personal  servants  of  the  upper  tier  state  actors.  As  a  result,  state  services  are  delivered  inequitably  across  class  and  income  groups.   In order to make up for the insufficient capacity of state service delivery machinery, nonstate 'for profit'  actors  are  engaged  in  the  service  delivery  process.  Private  firms  will  often  be  contracted  to  ensure  that  wealthy  neighbourhoods  are  provided  with  an  adequate  level  of  service.  Civil  society  actors  strive  to  provide  services  to  informal  settlements  either  in  cooperation  with  or  independently  of  the  state.  Many  commentators  (Zerah,  MH.,  2009,  De  Wit  and  Berner,  2009)  argue  that  nonstate  'for  profit'  actors  are  a  byproduct  of  neoliberal  policies  and  will  eventually  `substitute'  the  work  of  state  machinery  by  creating  markets  for  service  delivery  and  development.  Such  criticisms  rightly  point  out  that  the  efficiency  of  `forprofit'  actors  is  in  response  to  market  structures  and  financial  incentives,  rather  than  taking  responsibility  for  human  development.  However,  many  nonstate  actors  are  supporting  the  capabilities  of  the  state  by  developing  and  facilitating  alternative  service  delivery  models  to  counter  the  imbalances  created  by  market  forces.  My  study  findings  contribute  to  the  literature  by  helping  to  clarify  the  roles  played  by  different  tiers  of  state  actors.  Analysis  from  the  case  studies  reveals  the  pivotal  role  played by nonstate actors.  Most  of  the  interdisciplinary  research  treats  state  actors  simply  as  onedimensional  functionaries  in  a  homogenous  institutional  structure.  In  contrast,  my  research  distinguishes  between  the  capabilities  and  capacities  of  upper  and  lower  tier  state  and  nonstate  actors,  in  influencing  the  extension  or  denial  of  municipal services to informal settlements.  Many critical researchers dismiss state actors as corrupt and  accuse  nonstate  actors  of  attempting  to  substitute  for  the  state  as  part  of  the  neoliberal  project.  In  my  policy  examination  of  the  urban  water  and  sanitation  servicedelivery  context,  I  challenge  this  assumption  based  on  my  research  findings  and  analyzing  the  specific  roles  of  different  tiers  of  state  actors,  infrastructure,  and  institutions  of  service  delivery  provision.  I  also  assess  the  role  played  by  different  tiers  of  nonstate  actors  in  relation  to  informal  settlement  development  and  state  service delivery  machinery.  Many  comparative  institutional  studies  neglect  the  political  and  economic  context  that  affects  administrative  processes:  I  explore  these  relationships  by  establishing  linkages  between  neoliberal  policies,  corrupt  state  actors,  criminal  organizations,  and  weakened,  outdated  colonialera  policy frameworks. Additionally, most development studies contributions dismiss the role of state actors  in  servicedelivery  solutions.  In  contrast,  I  explore  the  differences  in  will  and  ability  between  different  12   

tiers  of  state  and  nonstate  actors  in  extending  services  to  informal  settlements.  These  differences  have  more  to  do  with  the  entrenchment  of  neoliberal  policy  thinking  which,  when  coupled  with  the  colonial  legacy of uppertier bureaucratic elites, ends up serving upper class interests.   

1.3 Issues in Informal Settlements and Informal Sector Research
Issues  related  to  informal  settlements  and  the  informal  sector  are  explored  by  examining  water  and  sanitation service delivery to informal settlements in Dhaka, Karachi, and Mumbai. I employed a layered  methodology,  supported  by  primary  and  secondary  research  on  the  roles  of  upper  and  lower  tier  state  and nonstate actors in extending services to informal settlements. Given the discontinuous and opaque  nature  of  state  institutions  and  data  sources,  I  employed  a  comparative  approach  to  manage  the  diversity  of  sources.  Qualitative  data  were  categorized  using  five  specific  comparator  variables  that  are  frequently  cited  across  the  urban  and  development  studies  literatures:  political  representation;  inter governmental  relations;  accountability  and  transparency;  pro  poor  initiatives  and  civil  society  engagement  via  NGOs  and  CBOs.  These  variables  were  used  to  categorize  factors  specific  to  upper  and  lower  tier  state  and  nonstate  actors  in  extending  services.  By  grouping  evidence  through  these  five  comparator  variables,  I  was  able  to  crossreference  and  triangulate  findings  between  different  actors,  levels  of  government,  and  mega  cities.  The  layered  methodology  included  a  case  study  heuristic,  which  enabled  comparisons  between  different  mega  city  (national)  policy  contexts.  Each  of  the  case  studies  demonstrates  how  specific  variables  act  as  determinants  of  successful  and  unsuccessful  service  delivery  outcomes.  Compared  with  previous  research,  my  analysis  offers  more  depth  and  resolution  in  terms  of  data related to mega cities.  

1.3.1 Informality: Distinguishing between the informal sector and informal settlements
Defining  the  informal  sector  and  its  relationship  with  informal  settlements  is  both  complex  and  multilayered  (IIED,  1995;  Wratten,  1995).  There  are  a  wide  range  of  debates  surrounding  informality,  the  informal  sector,  and  informal  settlements.  In  this  section,  I  describe  the  relationship  between  informality,  the  informal  sector  and  informal  settlements  as  they  are  related  to  the  research  problem  and  associated  questions.  I  will  return  to  some  of  the  definitions  in  my  concluding  chapter,  when  I 

13   

discuss the findings in light of the broader themes of urbanization, neoliberalism, informality and service  delivery to informal settlements.  South  Asia's  mega  cities  are  home  to  a  growing  population  of  migrant  workers,  many  of  whom  find  employment  within  the  informal  sector.  Supply  chains  that  drive  capitalist  production  in  urban  centres  often  begin  with  labour  and/or  materials  supplied  by  the  informal  sector.  As  market  competition  places  downward  pressure  on  input  prices,  a  growing  number  of  `undocumented  and  unregulated  companies'  and  firms  that  avoid  `paper  policy  compliance'  become  low  cost  suppliers  to  formal  sector  activities  (Mahadevia,  1998).  To  remain  competitive,  these  undocumented  companies  employ  large  numbers  of  informal sector labourers at wages far below those  of formal sector competitors. A persistent surplus of  migrant  labour  ensures  that  market  wages  remain  low.  The  ample  supply  of  lowcost  labour  subsidizes  formal  sector  profits,  perpetuating  the  cycle  of  polarization  between  capitalists  and  labourers.  This  is  evidenced by the chronically poor human development indicators of informal sector workers.   Unsurprisingly,  this  `informal'  or  `unorganized  sector'  has  been  identified  as  the  main  cause  of  surging  population  growth  (Davis,  2006).  Poorly  implemented  development  policies  and  state  indifference  have  resulted in increased internal displacement and ruraltourban migration, and a corresponding growth in  unplanned,  informal  settlements  and  communities  (Stren  et  al.,  1994;  Siddiqui,  2005).  Populations  across  these  communities  have  swelled  due  to  increases  in  the  numbers  of  informal  sector  workers  within  South  Asia's  urban  labour  pool  (Alavi,  1997;  Siddiqui  et  al.,  2004).  More  than  forty  percent  of  South  Asia's  urban  populations  are  employed  in  the  informal  or  unorganized  sector  (UN  Habitat,  2003).  The informal sector is defined by the United Nations as `those units which typically operate at a low level  of  organization,  with  little  or  no  division  between  labour  and  capital  as  factors  of  production  and  on  a  small  scale'  (ILO,  1993).  Others  see  the  informal  sector  as  a  bridge  to  employment  in  the  formal  sector  (Hart,  1973).  The  1976  ILO  study  of  the  informal  sector  along  with  other  UN  reports  has  generated  a  number  of  definitions.  For  my  purposes  here,  I  define  the  informal  sector  as  'labour  that  provides  flexible and elastic services to the formal sector and direct as well as indirect subsidies' (Bose, 1974).   To  retain  employment,  many  informal  sector  labourers  live  in  the  streets  or  informal  settlements  near  places  (construction  sites,  manufacturing  facilities)  of  work.  The  dense  and  impoverished  mega  cities  in  South  Asia  have  expanded  to  include  a  broad  range  of  informal  settlements.  Informal  settlements  have  long  histories  in  Africa,  Latin  America,  and  Asia  (Myers,  2010),  and  some  scholars  have  equated  them  with  slum  dwelling,  which,  by  most  accounts,  is  highly  prevalent  in  South  Asia:  on  average, 55.5  percent  14   

(Bangladesh),  84.7  percent  (India),  and  73.6  percent  (Pakistan)  of  urban  populations  reside  in  `slums'  and/or  lowincome  areas  (Davis,  2006).  My  policy  analysis  groups  slums  as  well  as  goths,  katchi  abadis  and bastis within the definition of informal settlements. I will return to this term momentarily.    Recent findings from urban research have identified multiple benefits and costs associated with informal  sector  labour.  For  instance,  whether  labourers  are  seasonal,  permanent,  displaced,  or  temporary,  their  relocation  has  been  linked  with  increased  remittances  to  home  towns  and  villages.  Increased  remittances  to  rural  towns  and  villages  have  been  found  to  play  a  role  in  alleviating  poverty  and  under development  (Yeung,  1994;  Siddiqui,  2005).  However,  the  presence  of  informal  workers  in  host  cities  places  a  substantial  burden  on  already  weak  municipal  servicedelivery  capacity.  A  political  economy  of  service  delivery  limits  human  development  among  migrant  workers  and  permits  human  deprivation  (MUH  HDC,  2011;  Myers,  2011).  From  this  perspective,  it  can  be  argued  that  healthier,  more  productive  informal  sector  workers  will  generate  more  remittances  and  contribute  to  improved  development  outcomes  for  rural  towns  and  villages.  In  policy  terms,  this  mean  improving  basic  services  to  informal  settlements.  Interdisciplinary  policy  research  on  informal  settlements  has  yielded  a  range  of  definitions.  Informal  settlements  are  defined  by  the  United  Nations  as  "those  households  residing  in  urban  or  periurban  areas  that  are  not  recognized  by  the  state  (as  part  of  GDP  calculations)  or  formally  connected  to  municipal services" (UN Habitat, 2003, pp 10). The terms `slums,' `unplanned communities,' `lowincome  areas,'  and  `squatter  settlements'  have  also  emerged  to  describe  unplanned  housing  that  lacks  formal  recognition  by  the  state  (UN  Habitat,  2003;  Davis,  2008).  I  apply  the  term  'informal  settlements'  to  clusters  of  such  communities  that  have  remained  unrecognized  by  the  state  and  which  over  time,  have  been  enveloped  by  expanding  urban  centres.  These  unrecognized  settlements  are  often  referred  to  as  `bastis',  `katchi  abadis,'  slums,  or  `goths'  in  urban  South  Asia.  Many  urban  centers  across  the  Global  South  continued  to  expand  and  engulf  more  of  such  settlements  into  their  municipal  jurisdictions.  Nevertheless,  informal  settlements  continued  to  struggle  with  access  to  basic  services.  In  2008,  a  UN  meeting  in  Nairobi  characterized  informal  settlements  as  being  overcrowded,  composed  of  poorly  constructed  and/or  informal  housing  structures  with  inadequate  access  to  safe  water  and  sanitation,  and  insecurity  in  terms  of  tenure  (UN  Habitat,  2008).  This  however,  has  not  stopped  some  informal  settlements  from  struggling  for  recognition.  More  recently,  informal  settlements  have  been 

15   

documented  as  mobilizing  and  struggling  to  obtain  access  to  basic  services  from  states  (SDI,  2010;  UN  Habitat, 2011).   Most previous research has focused on the marginalization of these communities as a result of exclusion  from  economic  opportunities  and  deprivation  due  to  the  absence  of  public  services  (Davis,  2005).  I  take  a  different  approach  by  focusing  on  the  experiences  of  informal  settlements  in  trying  to  engage  service  delivery  providers  and  gain  recognition.  Once  services  are  extended  to  informal  settlements,  the  settlements  do  gain  recognition  as  municipal  departmental  records  are  updated  and  revised  (land  title,  billing  collections,  etc.).  A  few  studies  have  investigated  engagement  between  the  state  and  informal  settlements  (Opel, 2000; Sethuraman, 1981). The sprawling informal settlements of Dhaka, Karachi, and  Mumbai  (home  to  the  largest  of  the  region's  slums, Dharavi)  face  common  challenges  in  accessing  state  services  (Reza,  2003;  Hasan,  2002;  Islam,  2005).  But  each  community's  struggles  for  infrastructure  and  human  development  continue  well  beyond  initial  state  engagement,  as  will  be  discussed  later  in  this  dissertation.   Informal  settlements  are  becoming  overcrowded  and  in  the  absence  of  services,  a  growing  number  of  informal  sector  workers  are  living  in  the  streets  (AM,  2012).  The  homelessness  of  these  `pavement  dwellers'  is  related  to  a  number  of  factors,  other  than  lack  of  space.  These  individuals  are  stigmatized,  treated as secondclass citizens, and excluded from urban development agendas and services (SDI, 2010;  Jain, 1999; Laquian, 2004). Many of them also come from ethnic and religious minorities that are outside  of  the  kinship  and  familial  circles  that  link  rural  villages  with  urban  informal  settlements.  The  highly  mobile and transient nature of this group makes their examination in policy and program terms difficult,  and  this  is  why  I  am  so  interested  in  examining  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements,  given  the  economic benefits they bring to South Asia's mega cities. 

1.4 Research Questions
Within  the  context  of  the  research  problem  and  the  aforementioned  policy  constraints  to  service  delivery, my study addresses the following research questions:    Given  this  dissertation's  understanding  of  informality,  how  successful  have 

inhabitants/representatives  of  informal  settlements  been  in  obtaining  specific  services  from  state functionaries?  

16   



Evidence  from  an  earlier  study  revealed  serious  contradictions  between  upper  and  lowertier  state  actors  (Shaheen,  F.H,  2009)  and  a  deplorable  response  to  meet  the  needs  of  informal  settlements.  In  light  of  these  incongruities,  have  the  latter's  needs  been  met  by  engaging  non state actors and/or lowertier state functionaries?  



What  implications  do  dynamics  between  informal  settlements,  nonstate  actors  and  lowertier  state  functionaries  have  for  service  delivery,  sustainability  and  autonomous  models  of  local  governance across the region's mega cities? 

1.5 Dissertation Structure
The  dissertation  is  divided  into  seven  short  chapters,  with  additional  information  included  in  the  appendix.  This  introductory  chapter  has  provided  an  overview  of  the  research  context  and  questions,  as  well  as  a  discussion  of  informality,  the  informal  sector,  and  informal  settlements.  The  political  economy  of  informality  is  critical  to  appreciating  the  policy  context  and  the  study's  purpose.  Acceptance  of  structural  adjustment  based  on  neoliberalism,  free  trade  thinking,  and  `antiagricultural'  policies  has  driven  waves  of  rural  labourers  to  urban  centres,  many  of  whom  are  unable  find  homes  and  are  forced  to live on the streets, close to their places of employment.   The  second  chapter  presents  the  theoretical  framework  of  the  study.  It  begins  with  an  overview  of  the  interdisciplinary  literature  on  urban  research  from  the  fields  of  public  administration,  critical  political  economy,  and  development  studies.  Each  discipline  presents  different  perspectives  on  service  delivery  in  urban  settings.  Unfortunately,  the  dominant  perspectives  tend  to  emerge  from  Western  or  Eurocentric  understandings  of  development  and  the  perceived  `optimal  function'  of  the  developmental  state.  Although  most  perspectives  highlight  the  human  development  needs  of  informal  settlements,  they stop short of addressing the frameworks or `arrangements' necessary to ensuring equitable service  delivery.  The  second  chapter  also  presents  a critical  discussion  of  neoliberalism  and  its  relationship  with  the informal sector.  The  third  chapter  explains  the  study's  methodology,  which  is  based  on  a  history  of  crosscountry  research  approaches  in  developing  country  and  municipal  contexts.  In  exploring  the  policy  history  of  each  mega  city,  I  researched  the  national,  subnational,  municipal,  and  institutional  settings  that  influence  service  delivery,  and  drew  on  these  data  to  gain  insights  into  broader  policies  and  programs.  The third chapter also explains the comparative framework that guided my qualitative approach.   17   

The  fourth,  fifth,  and  sixth  chapters  present  the  research  findings  from  each  of  the  three  megacities,  comparing  country  and  municipal  histories,  institutional  settings,  and  water  and  sanitation  service delivery  contexts.  These  chapters  explore  the  shared  colonial  legacies  and  provide  primary  and  secondary  evidence  for  each  context,  using  the  five  comparator  variables.  Two  case  studies  are  presented  for  each  mega  city,  clarifying  the  experiences  of  nonstate  actors  in  facilitating  service  delivery extension to communities.   The  seventh  and  final  chapter  presents  the  analysis,  conclusions,  and  policy  implications  for  future  research.  It  explores  relationships  between  upper  and  lower  tier  state  functionaries  and  nonstate  actors  and  clarifies  the  effects  of  colonialism  on  state  structures  and  bureaucratic  stratification.  Finally,  it  summarizes  the  regional  challenges  to  neoliberal  policies  and  topdown  development  approaches,  along  with  institutional  solutions  and  formalized  roles  for  nonstate  actors.  Let  us  now  turn  to  an  overview of prominent themes which emerge from my research. 

1.5.1

Emerging themes

A number of key findings and prominent themes respond to the research questions and engage broader  discussions  on  informal  settlements  (and  the  informal  sector),  the  colonial  legacy  (on  urban  development),  neoliberalism's  influence  (particularly  at  the  municipal  level),  service  delivery  as  facilitated  by  nonstate  actors  and  autonomous  modes  of  municipal  government.  First,  there  is  an  obvious  gap  between  the  will  and  objectives  of  upper  tier  state  actors  and  the  human  development  needs  of  informal  settlements  across  the  region's  mega  cities.  Second,  the  abilities  of  autonomous,  lower  tier  state  actors  are  evidenced  as  being  better  suited  to  engage  civil  society  to  enable  human  development,  as  compared  to  their  upper  tier  state  counterparts.  Finally,  mobilized  informal  settlements  (CBOs)  are  capable  of  moving  the  state  (specifically  lower  tiers)  Â­  corruption  and  all  notwithstanding  Â­  to  respond  to  their  service  delivery  needs.    CBOs  have  been  successful  in  ensuring  that services are extended to informal settlements, with some level of engagement with lowertier state  actors.   My  analysis  of  comparator  variables  and  case  study  outcome  elaborates  on  these  findings  through  five  themes  of  importance  in  terms  of  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements  in  mega  cities  in  South  Asia,  and by extension to developing countries: (1) Precariousness of informal settlements; (2) Colonial legacy  in  urbanization  and  postcolonial  realities;  (3)  Success  and  failures  of  community  based  mobilization;  (4)  18   

Need for decentralized governance models; and (5) The growing ruralurban divide and the absent state.  I will now provide a brief overview of these themes.  The  most  pronounced,  reoccurring  finding  from  my  dissertation  is  the  perseverance  of  informal  sector  labour  and  precariousness  of  informal  settlements.  Despite  the  prevalence  of  hazardous,  precarious,  lowwage  working  conditions,  informal  sector  labourers  have  continued  to  carve  out  valueadding  economic  niches  in  each  mega  city  economy.  The  findings  reveal  the  economic  benefits  provided  by  the  informal sector despite neglect by state actors.   The  research  findings  also  point  to  the  impact  of  the  colonial  legacy  and  neoliberalism  on  policy  failures  at  multiple  levels  of  government  that  have  over  time,  weakened  service  delivery  machinery.  My  interdisciplinary  research  points  to  the  need  to  reframe  policy  and  program  development  by  upper  and  lower  tier  actors  to  both  overcome  the  structural  impact  of  the  colonial  legacy,  and  to  move  away  from  a  strict  market  orientation.  Evidence  from  each  of  the  mega  city  service  delivery  contexts  reveals  tensions between upper and lower tier state and nonstate actors. The level of neglect demonstrated by  elected  officials  and  other  upper  tier  state  actors  for  informal  settlements  highlights  the  polarizing  impact of the colonial legacy on the developing state.   In  light  of  these  policy  failures,  my  research  highlights  the  role  that  civil  society  actors,  particularly  communitybased  organizations  (CBOs),  play  in  mobilizing  informal  settlements  and  linking  them  with  the service delivery capacities of lower tier water and sanitation authorities. Evidence from comparative  analysis  reveals  the  relationship  between  mobilized  communities,  lower  tier  state  engagement  and  positive  service  delivery  outcomes.  Evidence  also  reveals  the  constraints  of  political  interference,  unsustainable  capital  projects  and  absent  intergovernmental  support.  These  findings  challenge  the  mainstream development literature and counters calls for increased privatization.   Evidence  from  my  study  also  supports  the  need  for  decentralized  governance  models  and  institutional  strengthening,  which  echo  the  recommendations  of  public  administration  and  critical  management  researchers  on  increasing  public  utility  autonomy,  and  engagement  of  nonstate  actors  (which  is  accompanied  by  transparent  frameworks).  One  examples  is  the  success  of  Dhaka's  WASA  reforms,  as  profiled  in  the  case  studies,  which  points  to  the  expanded  reach  of  transparent,  departmental  cooperation  with  nonstate  actors.  This  is  in  contrast  to  the  corruption  that  plagues  the  works  department  in  Mumbai  and  weakens  the  departmental  mandates  of  the  KWSB  in  Karachi.  My  research  19   

highlights grassroots engagement of lower tier state actors, which are often hidden in community based  research.  In  contrast  to  the  literature,  my  evidence  points  to  the  benefits  of  accountability  and  transparency  frameworks,  established  through  formalized  engagement  between  state  and  nonstate  actors at the lowest tiers of state and society.   Finally, my research points to the growing ruralurban divide because of the spread of neoliberal policies  and  a  general  absence  of  state  support  for  informal  settlements.  In  order  to  reverse  the  overwhelming  tide of unemployed rural workers to urban centers, there is an urgent need for the state to invest in the  agricultural sector, resuscitate rural economies and balance the redistribution of wealth across polarized  segments  of  urban  society7.  The  continued  failure  of  upper  tiers  of  the  state  to  commit  to  such  policies  will  only  permit  the  continued  social  and  economic  polarization  of  rural  and  urban  society,  to  the  detriment of all.  My research points to the need to enable, empower and extend the reach of the lower tiers of the state,  in  partnership  with  representative  community  based  organizations  (CBOs).  Formalized  arrangements  between  lower  tier  state  and  nonstate  actors  can  counterbalance  the  poorly  formulated  development  polices  of  upper  tier  state  actors.  Once  communities  are  engaged  by  lower  tier  state  actors  as  partners  in  service  delivery  and  development,  the  surplus  that  is  being  lost  to  corruption  will  be  stopped  and  resources reinvested in community service delivery models. These solutions are not elaborated upon in  the  literature  nor  are  they  linked  to  policy  frameworks  in  so  far  as  mega  cities  are  concerned.  My  research  insists  on  the  inclusion  of  nonstate  actors  (NGOs  and  CBOs)  in  the  development  agenda  for  informal  settlements  as  integral  actors  in  mega  cities.  Such  measures  will  elevate  the  profile  of  local  service  delivery  knowledge  and  enable  the  sustainable  extension  of  services  to  informal  settlements.  Such  a  shift  in  resource  allocation  will  also  counter  the  dominant  forms  of  market  inspired,  topdown  urban  development  approaches  by  placing  the  needs  of  communities  and  people,  before  those  of

 Limited efforts have been made at the provincial level, at least in Punjab and to a lesser extent Sindh; where capacity building cells have been  created in the planning and development departments to build governance and planning capacity in small and medium sized cities in Punjab  and Sindh. While such efforts will require persistent, long term resource investments; the creation of these units within each province's  planning and development departments is evidence of the policy recognition to alleviate pressure from the nation's two largest cities, Lahore  and Karachi.

markets  and  profits  to  offset  the  trajectory  of  neoliberalism.  Such  a  shift  will  also  counter  balance  elite  power  and  expose  the  stranglehold  of  corrupt  state  actors  and  criminal  groups  on  public  goods  and  resources.  Closing  these  gaps  in  governance  and  urban  service  delivery  management  is  central  to  my  conclusions  as  market  failures  and  social  polarization  continue  to  characterize  the  three  mega  cities  in  South Asia.

2 Literature Streams and Divides
My  interdisciplinary  literature  review  draws  on  contributions  from  the  fields  of  public  administration,  critical  political  economy,  and  development  studies.8  Taken  separately,  these  disciplines  do  not  fully  engage the complexities surrounding administrative development policies, especially engagement of the  informal  sector  (Conticini,  2008).  By  situating  my  research  within  these  three  disciplines,  I  have  been  able  to  clearly  define  specific  enabling  factors  of  equitable  urban  policy  development  and  implementation  that  influence  positive  service  delivery  outcomes  (Andrews,  2010).  Prior  to  exploring  the  interdisciplinary  literature,  I  will  briefly  outline  the  linkages  between  the  literatures  and  the  dissertation research question.  First,  because  my  research  focuses  on  the  service  delivery  arrangements  that  engage  informal  settlements,  the  role  of  the  lower  tiers  of  the  state  is  central  to  my  study.  Despite  the  growth  of  urban  centres,  urban  research  has  a  noticeable  `intergovernmental  gap':  most  studies  focus  on  national  and  subnational  dynamics;  almost  no  studies  have  focused  on  municipal  resource  allocations,  implementation  or  sustainability.  Therefore,  I  have  used  comparative  public  administration  research  to  contrast  the  roles  of  the  upper  and  lower  tiers  of  the  state  in  `enabling'  or  `disabling'  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements.  Urban  `service  delivery'  and  `support'  are  inextricably  tied  to  the  condition  of  mega  city  government  policies  and  programs  (the  implementing  bureaucracy)  so  it  is  valuable  to  examine  the  comparative  public  administration  literature.  The  United  Nations  (UN)  continues  to  document  the  relentless  growth  of  mega  cities,  corridors  and  regions  across  the  Global  South  (UNDP,  2013).  Cross  country  researchers  have  documented  the  slow  incorporation  of  the  urban  policy  research  agenda  across  developing  municipalities  (Stren,  1994).  Analysis  also  reveals  the  accelerating  growth  of  South  Asia's  urban  areas  well  beyond  previous  forecasts  (Brookings,  2012).  Clearly,  urban  policy  development  has  been  out  paced  by  the  complex  challenges  that  face  mega  cities.  For  instance,  the  number  of  inhabitants  of  informal  settlements  is  growing  globally  by  ten  percent  per  annum  (UN

 Relevant contributions to the literature about South Asia's urban informal sector can also be found in other disciplines, e.g., urban planning,  sociology. In light of the policy focus, I include these contributions as part of the three streams (planning with public administration, sociology  as part of development studies, etc.). This process will help clarify the relationships between state and nonstate actors as outlined above.

Habitat,  2011).  Nevertheless,  there  is  a  persistent  lack  of  information  regarding  the  challenges  of  extending services to informal settlements and surging mega city populations (Flood, 1997; Davis, 2008).  South  Asian  policy  analysts  and  development  researchers  have  repeatedly  referred  to  this  trend  as  unmanageable,  given  the  current  patterns  of  migration,  resource  allocations,  governance,  and  unsustainable  development  (MUH  HDC,  2011;  CUS,  2010;  UNDP,  2010).  This  growing  and  yet  marginalized  segment  of  urban  society  is  in  urgent  need  of  policies  and  programs  to  address  the  lack  of  human development (ADB, 2008; MUH HDC, 1999).  Second,  because  power  relations  determine  the  distribution  of  resources  among  state  and  nonstate  service delivery providers, perspectives from critical political economy literature are important (Mainzer,  1994).  South  Asia's  centralized  planning  and  resource  disbursement  models  share  the  organizational  impressions  of  colonial  rule,  while  at  the  same  time,  postcolonial  administrative  structures  cannot  be  considered  homogenous  (Englebert,  2000).  This  is  especially  true  given  the  inequitable  development  of  South Asia's mega cities. Stateinfluenced processes of rural displacement, urbanization, mechanization,  and  the  green  revolution  have  all  contributed  to  the  migration  of  the  rural  poor  to  the  urban  fringe,  to  the  benefit  of  capitalist  elites  (Amin,  2011).  While  lower  tier  state  actors  are  overwhelmed  by  population  growth,  one  cannot  ignore  the  entrenched  interests  of  upper  tier  state  actors.  The  urban  poor  are  simply  treated  as  a  necessary  byproduct  of  development.  As  such,  my  study  is  sensitive  to  the  class  divisions  and  power  relations  across  state  and  informal  settlements  as  well  as  the  capitalist  modes  of development.   Third,  the  prominent  role  of  nonstate  actors  is  important  to  the  research  question,  given  their  success  in  extending  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements.  In  the  absence  of  an  overseeing,  transparent,  accountable  and  coordinating  state;  nonstate  actors  experience  success  in  isolated,  discontinuous  contexts.  The  documentation  of  such  cases  has  been  captured  throughout  the  development  studies  literature.  Some  researchers  have  analyzed  the  role  of  donors,  contrasting  mega  project  multilateral  donors  with  sectorspecific  funding  agencies  (Cohen,  M.,  2006).9  Researchers  have  also  categorized  the

 Contemporary development studies research on multilateral institutions, fuelled by the antiglobalization movement, has focused mainly on  the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and more recently the World Trade Organization. These studies have identified the 

23   

types  of  civil  society  actors,  outlining  key  differences  in  function,  capability,  capacity,  and  proximity  to  recipient  communities  (Sansom,  2006).  This  body  of  literature  is  characterized  by  a  growing  representation  of  Southbased  perspectives  and  critiques  of  Northern  assumptions  and  interests  in  service  delivery.  Specific  case  studies  that  document  the  engagement  of  informal  settlements  by  non state  actors  provide  valuable  perspectives  for  analysis.10  Specifically,  the  communitynetworked,  South based  nonstate  actor  is  more  likely  to  engage  informal  settlements  and  facilitated  interactions  with  state  actors.  Unfortunately,  few  studies  about  alternative  models  of  service  delivery  extension  to  informal settlements have focused on the required role and responsibility of the state. Research findings  and  analyses  from  this  field  elucidate  the  appropriate  arrangements  between  nonstate  and  state  actors, given the efforts of nonstate actors in facilitating service delivery.  Situating  my  research  within  these  three  bodies  of  literature  provides  a  more  comprehensive  policy  context  for  the  examination  of  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements.  Taken  together,  the    displacement,  marginalization  and  deprivation  of  informal  settlements  are  examined  as  part  of  a  social  and  political  process.  The  driver  of  this  process  is  a  polarized  state  that  passively  accepts  human  deprivation  and  inefficient  service  delivery  despite  the  emergence  of  alternative  models.  My  analysis  clarifies the potential of service delivery extension to  informal settlements by adjacent state actors with  appropriate  incentives  for  engagement.  The  following  discussion  reviews  specific  contributions  from  each  of  the  three  disciplines  to  the  study  of  informal  settlements  in  urban  contexts.  This  review  is  followed  by  a  summary  of  common  themes  that  affect  informal  settlement  policy  in  urban  settings  and  their  relevance  to  megacity  governance  in  South  Asia.  This  summary  also  establishes  a  framework  for  the  subsequent  chapter,  which  elaborates  on  the  dissertation  methodology.  Let  us  now  turn  to  the  first  body of literature, comparative public administration.  

                                                                                                                                                                                                       
shortcomings of these global donors and to a limited extent, the marginalized role of various United Nations departments and programs. At a  smaller scale, there has been some discussion of the role played by foreign governments and funding agencies, but discussions remain at the  national scale of study. Furthermore, they are concerned with advocacy and raising awareness, rather than actual service delivery. Sector specific funding efforts and donor activities are eclipsed by larger players. The expertise of sectorspecific donors requires understanding, as  they do not seek to displace local government machinery but rather resuscitate it, so that their work may continue alongside it.   10  The work of civil society organizations extending services to informal settlements is so valuable that actors within each of the megacities are  approached as part of the methodology to profile positive and negative outcomes of servicedelivery extension efforts.

2.1 Comparative Public Administration
A review of the Comparative Public Administration (CPA) literature revealed ample analysis of the role of  the  bureaucracy  in  developing  policy,  but  limited  analysis  of  the  bureaucracy  in  implementing  policy  (particularly  the  program  level  within  large  cities).  Research  highlights  how  the  `administration'  of  services  by  municipalities  in  developing  countries  has  been  irrevocably  affected  by  globalization  and  Neoliberalism  (UNDP,  2000).11  The  `contextless  nature'  of  public  administration  in  developing  states  continues  to  leave  them  vulnerable  to  a  range  of  externally  and  internally  driven  forces  (Haque,  1996).  The  combination  of  exogenous  forces  (market  pressure,  state  restructuring,  foreign  policy  dictates)  and  endogenous  factors  (weak  governance,  kinshipbased  politics,  elitist  interests,  ethnic  discord,  patronagebased  policies  and  corruption)  has  inhibited  the  maturation  of  indigenous  state  machinery  (Laquian,  2006).  The  under  representation  of  these  challenges  in  the  CPA  literature,  which  focuses  on  political change rather than administrative reform, has constrained progression within the literature as a  whole  (Farazmand,  2007).12  The  first  half  of  this  subsection  explores  the  history  of  CPA  and  the  response.  The  second  half  summarizes  differences  between  upper  tier  and  lower  tier  actors  in  service  delivery.  

2.1.1

Developments in CPA research and analysis

The  last  few  decades  of  municipal  policy  research  have  benefitted  from  a  number  of  comparative  initiatives  linking  Northern  and  Southern  institutions.  The  Harvard  School's  Woodrow  Wilson  initiative  spawned  a  program  of  comparative  urban  study  in  the  1980s,  publishing  research  across  the  Global  South.  In  the  early  1990s,  a  comparative  urban  research  project  was  established  at  the  University  of  Toronto,  which  profiled  the  field  work  of  state  and  nonstate  actors  in  large  cities  across  the  Global

 'Administration' in the context of developing countries refers to the policy, resource, and program delivery of state to society (Umeh and  Andranovich, 2005, Batley and Larbi, 2005). I will elaborate more on this in my discussion of upper and lower tiers of state and society and their  engagement of informal settlements. I introduce the dynamic between upper and lower tiers here, to highlight the gap that has persisted in the  literature regarding analysis on policies vs. programs. There is very little research, analysis or recommendations on improving administrative  processes across front line programs, against a landscape of social and political variables. My study contributes to informing a research agenda  regarding this gap.  12  Ironically, the absence of policybased research in the public management research stream has been replaced with concern for privatization  and the removal of policy power from the state sphere. Solutions are being developed without fully understanding the context within which the  existing systems of governance have failed. The specifics and enabling factors of 'open institutions' are underrepresented in the literature  (Goldsmith, 2007).

South.  Findings  from  these  citybased  institutions  has  highlighted  the  opaque  nature  of  municipal  data  as well as the tendency of public administration scholarship to view cities simply as economic engines of  growth  rather  than  as  places  of  habitation  (Stren  et  al.,  1994).  This  research  has  been  validated  by  coordinated  data  analysis  with  partner  institutions  across  the  Global  South,  many  of  which  have  relied  on United Nations programs, sector specific donors, and other multilateral agencies (Stren et al., 1994). I  will  return  to  the  contributions  of  these  Southbased  institutions  later,  but  it  is  important  to  note  that  these  analyses  indicate  that  megacity  leadership  is  driven  by  economic,  rather  than  social,  priorities.  A  policy agenda focused on economic growth continues to neglect administrative systems that are needed  to  address  the  social  concerns  of  housing,  infrastructure,  and  basic  services.  As  such,  linkages  between  capitalistic  industrialization,  economic  growth  and  pro  poor  outcomes  are  poorly  understood  (Shah  and  Batley, 2009).  The  response  of  state  policymakers  to  research  about  urban  challenges  has  been  insufficient,  due  to  a  number  of  exogenous  and  endogenous  factors.  Exogenous  factors  beyond  the  control  of  the  state  include  the  residual  impressions  of  colonialism,  state  restructuring,  marketcentred  development,  and  neoliberal  policies.  Simultaneously,  administrative  development  has  been  outpaced  by  ruraltourban  migration  and  economic  restructuring  (Stren,  1996).  The  resulting  institutional  `path  dependency'  has  distracted  state  actors  and  institutions  from  developing  and  defining  truly  sovereign  policies  and  programs,  particularly  at  local  levels  of  government  (Farazmand,  2002;  Dwivedi,  1989).  Endogenous  forces  such  as  weak  governance  frameworks  and  a  lack  of  transparency  and  accountability  have  constrained  institutional  development  and  neutralized  capacity  development  among  frontline,  municipal  departments.  Discussions  around  `good'  and  `bad'  governance  have  neglected  the  examination  of  program  outcomes  (Brinkerhoff  and  Goldsmith,  2004).  The  concentration  of  power  within  central  `elite'  departments  of  upper  tier  policy  circles  has  prevented  any  real  sustained  flow  of  resources  to  lower  tier  actors  and  implementing  institutions  (Farazmand,  1999).  Concurrent  research  agendas  have  also  been  framed  by  Western  understandings  and  models,  further  constraining  a  sovereign  agenda  of  policy  development  by  local  policy  actors  (Umeh  and  Andranovich,  2005).  For  example,  there  has  been  little  evidence  of  nationallymandated  cooperation  between  municipalities  to  face  these  challenges.  Caught  between  national  interests,  daytoday  operational  realities  and  strategic  challenges,  many  of  the  shared  challenges  facing  megacity  administrations  across  the  region  remain  unaddressed across Asia in delivery of basic services (Chaudhury and Devarajan, 2006). 

26   

Public  administration  and  development  research  has  also  been  insufficient,  due  to  constraints  of  focus  and scale.  Research has continued  to focus on national and provincial policy changes and administrative  developments  in  the  wake  of  electoral  patterns  and  policy  activism  and  has  not  engaged  the  relationships  of  statenonstate  providers  at  the  municipal  level  (Farazmand,  2001;  Moran,  2006;  Batley  and  Larbi,  2005).  Multilateral  institutions  and  transnational  INGO  research  focuses  on  high  level  top  down  policy  programs,  where  they  have  capacity,  but  perhaps  not  the  relevant  state  actors  (UNDP,  2000).  Other  streams  deal  mainly  with  public  management  and  economics  (Madhoo,  2007).  Some  governance  studies  have  examined  the  preconditions  of  decentralization  (Sellers  and  Lidstrom,  2008).  However,  few  studies  have  focused  on  how  policies  and  programs  affect  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements  in  mega  cities  (Khan,  1991).  There  are  few  proposals  regarding  intergovernmental  policy  reforms  that  will  ensure  effective  urban  government  (Shami,  2001;  Stren,  2001).  Intergovernmental  research  has  revealed  that  federal  and  provincial  interference  in  urban  affairs  has  negatively  affected  the  sustainability  of  municipal  service  delivery  (Reza,  2003;  Hasan,  2002).  This  trend  is  repeated  across  as most urban policy studies focus on describing interests rather than engaging institutional analysis.   The  origins  of  CPA  reveal  limitations  in  the  progression,  agenda,  and  approach  to  studying  municipal  policy  challenges  across  the  Global  South.  Initial  CPA  research  approaches  were  rooted  largely  in  replicating the structures, institutions and processes of Weberian governments. These approaches failed  to  take  into  account  the  complex  interests  that  converge  on  municipal  settings  where  market  interactions  and  state  processes  are  simultaneously  in  conflict  and  cooperation  (Farazmand,  2010).  Subramaniam's  critical  review  of  Western  approaches  to  administrative  development  in  the  Third  World,  argued  that  many  of  the  constraints  can  be  traced  to  colonialism  and  neocolonial  pressure  during  the  postCold  War  period  (Subramaniam,  1998).  Most  of  the  scholarly  work  conducted  in  the  1950s and 1960s focused on the effects of colonialism as well as the political, social, and historical facets  of  development  that  restricted  economic  growth.  Little  attention  was  paid  to  bureaucracies,  let  alone  local  government  institutions  or  service  delivery  machinery  in  rapidly  urbanizing  centres.  In  the  1960s  and 1970s, dependency theories built on this work. These movements followed neoMarxist approaches  and  attributed  the  poor  situation  in  the  developing  world  to  colonial  rule  and  its  subservient  state  structures.  In  the  1980s,  development  administration  research  was  linked  with  public  administration  research  in  response  to  dependency  theorists.  Riggs  and  Heady  illustrated  how  administrative  systems  are  linked  with  complex  social  and  political  systems  (Riggs,  1989;  Heady,  1980).  Another  set  of  development  administration  research  emerged,  with  the  intent  of  readying  developing  economies  for  27   

the  pressures  of  economic  globalization  (Farazmand,  2004).  This  work  would  inform  upper  tier  state  policy  makers  on  free  market  policies  following  the  end  of  the  Cold  War.  The  2000's  has  seen  an  era  of  capacity building take hold at the lower tiers, which are struggling to make cities more selfsufficient and  selfreliant  (Gupta  and  Rayadurgan,  2008).  In  all  cases,  very  little  CPA  research  has  focused  on  under developed  lower  tier  institutions  and  inherent  policy  frameworks,  beyond  case  studies  (Gershenberg,  1998).   Preliminary  research  from  urban  Pakistan  revealed  sharp  differences  between  upper  and  lower  tiers  of  the  state  in  capability  and  capacity  to  extend  services  to  the  informal  sector  (Shaheen,  2009).  The  key  finding  of  Pakistanbased  research  was  the  differential  attitude  between  upper  and  lower  tiers  of  the  state.  Research  also  revealed  sharp  differences  between  upper  and  lower  tier  nonstate  actors.  Where  isolated  successes  in  service  delivery  extension  were  realized,  lower  tier  NGOs  were  present  in  facilitating  and  mobilizing  CBOs.  Critical  analyses  which  hold  the  state  accountable  for  the  delivery  of  basic  services  recognizes  the  existence  of  power  relations  and  much  needed  reforms.  In  policy  terms,  the  upper tiers of the state are concerned with  development and formulation of policies that define  the  capabilities  of  mega  city  administrations.  `Upper  tiers'  include  departments  and  offices  at  the  national  (and  to  some  extent,  provincial)  level  of  government  that  are  focused  on  setting  agendas,  formulating  and  developing  policies,  as  determined  by  the  political  factors  and  administrations  of  the  day.  Budget  decisions  and  resource  allocations  are  developed  at  this  level  for  lower  tier  departments.  However,  all  too often are such policies developed without addressing implementation and resource requirements at  the  lower  tiers.  Upper  tier  departments  are  characterized  by  access  to  resources,  formalized  cadres  of  upwardaspiring officers, proximity to budget funding, hierarchical networks, alignment with centralized  capital  budget  resources  and  `gate  keeper'  expert  status  with  multilateral  institutions.   The  networks  of  relationships at this level of government operate through direct and indirect channels to ensure a critical  level  of  budgetary  roles  and  responsibilities.  This  tier  is  technically  unfamiliar  with  reallife  conditions  and  specific  interventions  to  alleviate  poverty.  Nevertheless,  they  leverage  political  budgetary  aims  and  navigate  client  relations  with  politically  aligned  departments,  enabling  the  release  of  funds  to  specific  areas of government activity without requiring much accountability for performance or outcomes.   The  attitude  of  these  upper  tiers  of  the  state  is  reminiscent  of  colonial  rule,  characterized  by  strong  central  governments  with  an  elite  cadre  of  officers  that  are  similar  in  rank  and  profile.  The  political  and  economic  elite  of  the  upper  tiers  include  highranking  officials  who  enjoy  privilege  and  position  within  28   

society. Groomed and bred through elite schools (also institutional remnants from the colonial era), they  do not mix with, nor are they infiltrated by, outsiders. Given their position within society as well as their  profile,  they  occupy  a  strata  that  is  considerably  better  off  than  most.  Based  on  informant  interviews  and a critical review of the policy and development literature, the upper tiers are merely concerned with  navigating  periods  of  political  change,  rather  than  improving  public  service  delivery.  Their  knowledge  of  loopholes  across  departmental  policies  and  procedures  allows  them  to  informally  engage  elites  from  nonstate  sectors.  The  result  is  the  exchange  of  favors  and  often  the  appropriation  of  public  assets  for  their  own  benefit,  mainly  in  the  form  of  unallocated  tracts  of  land  (Subramanian,  1998).  Their  circles  of  influence  include  the  wealthy  elite  from  economic  and  business  circles.  The  client  and  patronage  cycle  perpetuates  itself  within  these  elite  circles  along  with  the  incentives  to  maintain  positions  of  power  and  influence.  Issues  of  relevance  to  the  public  service  and  the  betterment  of  society  are  neglected,  as  reflected  by  inequitable  modes  of  government  and  service  delivery  (Bourdieu,  1998).  The  effects  of  policy  agenda  setting,  formulation  and  development  at  the  upper  tiers  has  immediate  impacts  on  implementation at the lower tiers of government.  Lower  tiers  of  the  state  are  defined  as  those  at  the  level  of  local  government  (and  to  a  limited  extent,  provincial  government).  In  contrast  to  the  upper  tier,  lower  tier  government  departments  and  agencies  are  largely  responsible  for  operating  and  maintaining  existing  infrastructure  and  staterun  programs.  Lower  tier  actors  are  responsible  for  the  service  delivery  infrastructure  of  mega  cities  and  reside  in  municipal  departments.  Isolated  from  the  policy  making  environment,  these  actors  staff  the  offices  of  the  urban  cities  of  South  Asia.  Their  budgets  are  understated  and  underfunded,  with  limited  support  from  upper  tiers  of  the  state.  Research  on  Karachi  revealed  that  the  local  government  was  fraught  with  structural  challenges  (poor  intergovernmental  relations,  accountability  and  transparency  frameworks),  and  illconceived  extensions  of  service  delivery  policies.  Lower  tier  officers  are  professionals  of  varying  levels  of  capacity  and  capability.  Their  departments  are  often  mandated  with  an  unrealistic  set  of  responsibilities  with  little  coordination  with  adjacent  institutions.  In  most  cases,  upper  tiers  have  not  devolved  any  authority  to  lower  tiers  (local  government)  to  engage  in  revenue  generation  or  cost recovery  programs.  Although  the  upper  tier  acts  as  a  guide  and  inform  the  responsibilities  of  municipal  government,  the  lower  tiers  are  provided  with  limited  support  to  implement  and  fulfill  those  mandates  (Hasan,  2008;  Islam,  2004;  Van  Horen,  2004).  Chronic  problems  such  as  disrepair  and  insufficient  performance  are  handled  using  emergency  funds  and  politically  motivated  rehabilitation  efforts.  When  policy  outcomes  are  positive,  upper  tier  budget  allocations  are  justified  without  any  provision  for  29   

sustaining  operational  and  maintenance  concerns  at  the  frontlines.  In  other  words,  if  a  program  is  delivered  successfully,  upper  tier  departments  take  credit;  chronic  failures  of  program  delivery  (and  all  related problems) are shouldered by underfunded lower tier departments.   Despite  their  marginalized  role,  mounting  responsibilities  and  frustrating  operating  context;  lower  tier  departments  possess  a  wealth  of  operational  knowledge  and  expertise  about  the  actual  urban  environment,  which  has  been  leveraged  by  nonstate  actors.  Many  urban  policy  settings  across  the  Global  South  reveal  lower  tier  support  for  nonstate  research.  Although  lower  tier  state  documents  will  be  cited  in  academic  publications,  the  formal  policy  development  process  rarely  engages  these  experts  as  part  of  the  overall  planning  process.  Furthermore,  upper  tier  policy  development  will  rarely  engage  lower  tier  counterparts  in  the  design  of  `poverty  alleviation  programs'.  Nonstate  actors  (private  and  nongovernment organizations) have learned how to leverage this critical mass of lower tier knowledge.  Private  sector  solutions  along  with  community  led  development  initiatives  are  sometimes  designed  and  built  with  some  level  of  input  from  lower  tier  actors.  Lower  tier  state  actors  are  motivated  to  engage  these  nonstate  actors  as  it  provides  them  with  an  opportunity  to  demonstrate  technocratic  merit.  In  many mega cities, local media outlets (and upper tier nonstate actors) are all too eager to lay blame for  ineffective  service  operation  on  lower  tier  departments.  Lower  tier  state  actors  are  more  willing  to  engage  familiar  nonstate  actors  who  recognize  their  skills  and  knowledge.  Their  forums  provide  lower  tier  state  actors  with  a  voice  and  opportunity  to  present  their  perspectives  and  experience  on  service  delivery.  In  return,  these  lower  tier  state  actors  facilitate  nonstate  efforts,  alternative  service  delivery  models  and  pilot  projects.  Just  as  it  is  important  to  differentiate  between  upper  and  lower  tiers  of  the  state,  it  is  important  to  differentiate  between  upper  and  lower  tiers  of  nonstate  actors,  based  on  their  mandates. I will now turn to a review of the CPA literature regarding these groups.    

2.1.2

Civil Society, the City and the Global South

Although  lower  tier  actors  remain  understudied,  recent  CPA  contributions  have  focused  on  nonstate  actors.  The  contributions  of  urban  policy  research  and  advocacy  institutions  have  been  documented  across  Latin  America,  Asia,  and  the  Middle  East  (Shami,  2001;  Stren,  2001).  Management  experts  have  also  promoted  partnerships  with  nonstate  actors  as  a  solution  to  poor  government  performance.  Research about inputs to positive service delivery has also explored the relationships between state and  nonstate  actors  with  regard  to  critical  services  such  as  water  supply  and  electricity  (Rondinelli,  1991).  The  evolution  of  nonstate  actors  in  South  Asia  has  been  marked  by  periods  of  cooperation  and  30   

competition  with  state  actors  (Nair,  2011).  The  lack  of  collaboration  in  policy  planning  is  alarming  despite  the  significance  of  nonstate  contributions  (Batley,  2006).  To  this  end,  public  administration  scholars  have  developed  typologies  of  state  and  nonstate  engagement  (Stein,  1993;  Sansom,  2006;  Batley  and  Larbi,  2005).  Contributions  outline  `desirable'  relationships  between  state  and  nonstate  actors  in  specific  contexts,  which  are  urgently  needed  in  larger,  denser  mega  cities  (Sansom,  2011).  For  example, megacity administrators need to appreciate the appropriate policy settings for the `scaling up'  vs.  `replication'  of  alternative  modes  of  service  delivery  and  their  enabling  frameworks  (Brinkerhoff,  1999).  `Scaling  up'  may  be  beneficial  where  increasing  the  volume  of  services  delivered  may  be  appropriate.  However,  where  capital  funds  and  maintenance  costs  present  a  constraint,  `replication'  may be more appropriate.  In the latter  case, service delivery mechanisms (a pump or toilet  block) might  be  created  and  maintained  in  a  separate  community.  Clearly,  the  social  and  technical  features  of  such  options  require  a  series  of  policy  steps  prior  to  being  realized.  The  frameworks  that  enable  the  realization of such arrangements will be explored in more detail in this dissertation. In other words, how  can  utility  management  staff  and  residents  of  informal  settlements  cooperate  to  maintain  public  and  community based service delivery infrastructure (pumps, pipes, billing systems).  Southbased contributions to the body of CPA literature tend to emphasize the roles and responsibilities  of  local  government  actors  in  managing  service  delivery  discrepancies  between  various  groups  (Batley  and Larbi, 2005). Research recognizes the need for fragile states to ensure that nonstate alternatives do  not  delegitimize  state  processes  (Batley  and  McLoughlin,  2010).  Accountability  is  central  to  preserving  the  role  of  the  state  (Cavill  and  Sohail,  2004).    In  an  effort  to  inform  administrative  and  management  policies  on  urban  service  delivery,  my  research  will  assess  the  enabling  political  and  administrative  settings  in  the  various  service  contexts,  in  contrast  to  the  predominant  topdown  approach  to  policy  development.  The  upper  tiers  of  the  state  have  influenced  the  trajectory  of  economic  development  to  the  detriment  of  local  governments.  The  lower  tiers  of  the  state  must  be  enabled  to  manage  the  operational  realities  of  social  polarization  (Shaheen,  2009;  Laquian,  2006).  My  research  will  inform  the  role  of  state  and  actors  and  cooperation  with  nonstate  actors  to  allow  local  government  reforms  and  programs  to  be  more  equitably  delivered  (BrennanGaluw,  2004;  Siddiqui  et  al.,  2004;  Hart  and  Mitlin,  1996).  In  order  to  ensure  that  services  are  provided  in  a  depoliticized,  equitable,  servicedelivery  focused  manner,  a  more  participatory  approach  that  is  engaging  of  local  values  and  behaviours  will  be  required (Zaidi, 2008; Umeh and Andranovich, 2004).

Evidence from administrative and management studies point to the constraints that are placed on lower  tier actors at the `bottom of the pyramid' (Prahalad, 2011). Policy discussions on autonomy change from  within  and  decentralization  are  constrained  by  graft  and  corruption  (Laquian,  2005;  Khan,  1991).  The  RiggsBrainbanti  debate  encapsulates  the  state  of  ThirdWorld  institutions  and  the  growth  of  bureaucracy  (Ahmed,  2008).  Donor  funding  patterns  have  also  influenced  policy  priorities  and  program  decision  making  within  a  prefectural  bureaucracy  (Aranaral,  2008;  Ahmed,  2008).  While  Neoliberalism  has  traumatized  and  restructured  the  developing  state,  it  has  also  irrevocably  affected  the  social  and  economic balance of urban and rural development across South Asia and the Global South. I now turn to  this issue in the next section of this chapter. 

2.2 Critical Political Economy
Many  critiques  of  Neoliberalism  emerge  from  South  Asia,  as  inequality  increases  and  the  plight  of  the  poor  continues  to  be  seen  as  buoying  the  risk  leveraged  by  the  wealthy  elite.  Recent  critiques  of  South  Asia's  political  economy  have  made  powerful  contributions  to  the  postcolonial  literature.  For  example,  the  seminal  works  of  Said  and  Bhabha  have  contributed  to  poststructuralist  understanding  of  the  `postcolonial'.  Similarly,  past  and  recent  scholarship  has  explored  imperialism  and  nationalism  as  by products  of  colonial  domination  and  anticolonial  resistance  and  within  the  context  of  social,  political,  and  cultural  differences  across  South  Asia  (Alavi,  1998;  Ahmad,  2007;  AminKhan,  2012).  Critical  theorists  have  rigorously  analyzed  globalization  and  the  impact  of  neoliberal  designs  on  financial  and  economic  power  balances  (Amin,  2011;  Haque,  2001).  Critical  approaches  (concerned  with  national  levels of activity) view public management as a byproduct of colonialism, where administrative systems  are  dominated  by  bureaucrats  and  an  upper  class  `salariat'  among  other  interest  groups  (Zafarullah  and  Haque,  1998;  Alavi,  2002).  Some  approaches  emphasize  the  different  circumstances  under  which  state  formation  has  taken  place  across  the  developing  world  and  as  such,  argue  that  any  analysis  which  employs  structures  or  policy  instruments  inherent  to  'modern  western  states'  is  limited.  The  hegemony  imposed  by  elites,  dichotomous  to  the  will  and  social  organization  of  the  people,  cannot  go  unchallenged  through  any  analytical  lens.  In  order  to  account  for  this  limitation,  social  movements  and  other  nonstate  actors  are  focussed  on.  Recent  studies  have  focused  on  resistance  and  urban  social  movements,  but  have  neglected  the  different  roles  of  state  actors  and  institutions  (Gills,  2001;  McFarlane,  2008).  This  subsection  reviews  South  Asian  perspectives  on  urban  development  and  administration  from  a  critical  political  economy  perspective.  I  begin  with  a  brief  history  of  South  Asia's  32   

urban  `disruption'  under  colonial  rule,  followed  by  a  summary  of  the  resulting  urban  administrative  context  across  the  three  countries  of  study.  Next,  I  outline  the  current  framework  of  challenges  facing  urban  development  and  administrative  change,  specifically  in  terms  of  migratory  labor  inflows  and  financial  capital  outflows.  The  section  concludes  with  a  critical  examination  of  the  various  nonstate  actors  involved  in  the  service  delivery  supply  chain  and  their  role  in  engaging  state  actors  to  extend  service delivery to the informal sector.  The  lack  of  critical  research  about  megacity  development  and  densification  is  related  to  the  genesis  of  critical  political  economy  research  across  the  Global  South.  Urban  politics,  for  example,  are  not  one  dimensional and require comparative analysis (Mazinoshou, 1985). First, researchers have not unpacked  the  different  tiers  of  the  bureaucracy  and  agents  of  the  state  in  postcolonial  urban  contexts.  Few  researchers  have  examined  `Third  Worldism'  and  the  impact  of  its  decline  on  urban  settings,  socialist  urbanplanning  experiments,  or  the  dissolution  of  these  experiments  in  the  face  of  spreading  imperialism  (Prashad,  V.,  2010).  Second,  critical  research  has  tended  to  focus  on  national  political  events,  interests,  and  ideas  Â­  with  little  reference  to  their  deleterious  effects  within  large  urban  centres  (Ahmed,  2000).  Some  researchers  have  referred  to  the  international  and  national  implications  of  globalization  on  the  nationstate  and  citizenry,  highlighting  the  polarization  of  power  structures  globally  and  even  regionally  (Amin,  2011;  Prashad,  2007).  These  forces  have  a  clear  and  direct  impact  on  large  urban  centres  across  South  Asia.  A  brief  history  of  the  events  that  characterized  precolonialism  and  colonialism in the region's urban centres is necessary to contextualize the emergence of socioeconomic  polarization and the resulting social resistance. This period can be divided into two phases, during which  cities are directly and indirectly affected by colonial rule and policies. 

2.2.1

Periods of colonial rule

The  initial  phase  of  colonization  resulted  in  the  dismantling  of  the  indigenous  machinery  that  upheld  political  and  economic  activity  across  South  Asia's  urban  centres.  Precolonial  urban  societies  were  characterized  by  a  separation  between  nobility/rulers  and  merchants/tradesman.  Precolonial  markets  were  underpinned  by  multitalented  functionaries  and  guilds  of  workers.  This  kind  of  system  flourished  prior  to  and  after  the  discovery  of  the  IndianÂ­European  trade  route.  During  the  periods  of  colonial  rule,  two  objectives  were  achieved.  Initially,  there  was  the  eradication  of  the  remains  of  Asiatic  modes  of  governance.  Through  the  progression  of  colonial  rule,  a  number  of  processes  were  entrenched  that 

33   

contributed  to  the  spread  of  capitalism  and  Neoliberalism  (Alavi,  2004;  Khan,  1999).  I  will  briefly  discuss  these two phases and their effect on urban development.  The  first  phase  of  colonial  rule  resulted  in  the  transfer  of  wealth  from  India's  land  revenue,  resulting  in  the  pauperization  of  farmers  during  periods  of  famine.  This  transfer  of  wealth  to  foreign  nobility  ended  the  cycle  of  reinvestment  and  circulation  of  wealth  in  the  urban  economy,  thereby  depriving  local  markets  and  merchants  of  resources  to  sustain  them.  The  result  was  older  cities  such  as  Dhaka,  contracting  in  growth,  when  political  power  shifted  to  Kolkata  (Siddiqui  et  al.,  2000).  The  Industrial  Revolution  of  the  early  1700s,  led  to  the  export  of  wealth  to  colonial  heartlands,  leaving  local  textile  industries  decimated  (Alavi,  1996).  As  local  industrial  bases  changed,  so  did  the  revenues  that  sustained  local  governments  and  the  networks  of  panchayats  that  facilitated  the  participation  of  neighbourhoods  and  otherwise  disconnected  communities  in  the  functioning  of  the  cities.  Industrialization  and  patterns  of  reinvestment  perpetuated  the  cycle  of  inequity  in  rural  vs.  urban  development,  which  led  to  the  second phase of colonial impact on urban development.  The  second  phase  of  colonial  rule  targeted  the  subcontinent's  rural  heartlands,  with  exportdriven  industries strengthened by the economic development of urban centres. In the 1800s, British capital was  invested  in  Indian  industries  such  as  plantations  and  extractive  sectors,  and  those  sectors  saw  growth  and  drove  exports.  Local  `coolies'  were  employed  at  serflike  wage  levels  to  provide  labour  for  these  undertakings  (Gadgil,  1973).  British  interests  were  then  set  to  increase  the  commercialized  exports  of  cotton  through  infrastructure,  facilitated  by  canal  irrigation  as  well  the  construction  of  the  railways  in  the  late  1800s.  Industry  continued  to  thrive  in  rural  areas  and  exportled  growth  dominated  the  rural  landscape.  As  agriculture  became  more  subordinate,  the  peasantry  were  inevitably  reduced  to  landless  labourers.  These  laborers  began  searching  and  migrating  for  employment  and  populated  the  decaying  city  of  Dhaka,  which  had  already  lost  a  substantial  amount  of  its  population  to  deterioration  and  the  devastating  shifts  of  investment  during  the  previous  century.  Colonial  policies  had  succeeded  in  establishing  the  foundations  of  the  export  led  growth  model.  This  model  of  development  would  continue  to  drive  urban  economic  growth  and  the  spread  of  market  based  decision  making.  Export  led  growth has also turned state concerns away from feeding domestic markets and sustaining supply chain  and  demand  cycles.  For  example,  ten  percent  of  India's  grain  is  lost  to  rot  while  another  ten  percent  to  pilferage  (CUTS,  2000).  Each  of  the  three  nations  has  struggled  with  development  agendas  in  the  shadow of this colonial legacy.  34   

Urbanization  accelerated  across  South  Asia  during  the  transition  to  Neoliberalism  inspired  market  led  growth.  Bangladesh's  urban  centres  swelled  with  economic  activity  following  industrialization,  with  the  highest levels of ruraltourban migration reached in Dhaka. India and Pakistan saw the disappearance of  older  class  groups  and  the  creation  of  new  ones,  which  contributed  to  the  formation  of  the  urban  elite.  The  educated,  industrialized,  and  financial  hub  of  Mumbai  quickly  became  the  economic  centre  of  Indian  capitalism.  Ethnic  communities  that  exploited  the  flows  of  trade  formed  the  new  bourgeoisie,  founded  on  the  cotton  textile  industry.  Foreign  trained,  upward  aspiring  professionals  were  trained  to  sustain  subservient  colonial  era  state  hierarchies  and  develop  provincial  laws  and  municipal  bylaws  to  govern  these  cities.  In  Pakistan,  a  professionalized  bureaucracy  was  dominated  by  the  military  bureaucratic oligarchy and larger landowners. India's metropolitan industries formed a new dependency  on  foreign  capital  through  agreements  about  technology  that  sustained  the  competitive  edge  of  industry.  Pakistan  and  Bangladesh's  metropolises  have  grown  dependent  on  the  presence  of  multinationals (Alavi, 1998). The  coordinated relocation and departure of wealth from the region during  colonial  rule  continued  with  Neoliberalism.  The  acceleration  of  globalized  financial  flows  and  transnational  corporate  activities  is  also  referred  to  as  neocolonialism  (Ahmad,  1992;  Amin,  2011).  Market led growth has not been matched by improved capacity at the lower tiers of the state.  The  polarization  of  power  between  upper  and  lower  tiers  is  rooted  in  colonial  era  policies.  In  the  17th  century, the presidency towns of the East India Company were separated into `White' and `Black'. While  the  former  experienced  well  maintained  infrastructure  and  services,  the  latter  were  left  in  squalor.  The  1800s  saw  the  piloting  of  local  government  structures  (courtesy  of  Lord  Ripon's  altruistic  resolution,  to  prevent  the  spread  of  disease  to  White  enclaves),  but  very  little  was  implemented  across  India.  In  fact,  command  and  controltype  approaches  reminiscent  of  colonial  rule  characterized  intergovernmental  relations well beyond this period. For example, in Dhaka, it was quite common to have local concessions  offered  to  legitimize  authoritarian  rule  at  the  national  level  (Siddiqui  et  al.,  2000).  Central  government  power  over  municipal  budgets,  functions  and  council  decisions  have  led  to  poor  governance  (Huque,  2001). In the late 1980s and 1990s, all municipalities in the three countries were superseded, resulting in  stunted growth and development (Sivakumarakrishnan, 1999).   At  present,  most  of  South  Asia's  largest  cities  receive  less  than  fifty  percent  of  the  GDP  contributions  required  to  maintain  and  sustain  basic  services  and  infrastructure  including  roads  and  transportation  (ADB, 2010). The inequitable distribution of power that characterizes South Asia's economic and political  35   

development  explains  the  relative  `enslavement'  of  underresourced,  undercapacity  lower  tiers  of  the  state  by  dominant  upper  tiers.  Decisions  such  as  increasing  taxes  and  water  rates,  firing  superfluous  labour,  and  demolishing  unauthorized  construction  are  difficult  for  decentralized  administrations,  but  not  for  a  central  governmentappointed  administrator  (Siddiqui  et  al.,  2000).  Selfinterest  and  the  tone  of  indifference  that  characterizes  upper  tier  actors  has  placed  an  irreversible  drain  on  public  finances  and funding resources needed at the level of megacity administrations.  

2.2.2

Portrayal of Lower Tier State Actors in the Literature

Many  critical  theorists  treat  administrative  machinery  (the  bureaucracy)  as  integral  to  the  capitalist  processes  of  wealth  accumulation  and  the  erosion  of  developing  countries  and  cities.  However,  development researchers from across the Global South point to the limited attention that Marxists have  given  to  the  discussion  of  local  government  (Umeh  and  Andranovich,  2006;  Farazmand,  2002;  Heady,  1998).  Limited  but  compelling  evidence  from  across  the  Urban  South  points  to  sharp  differences  between  lower  and  upper  tiers  of  the  state.  One  example  of  this  is  the  dominant  and  disproportionate  presence  of  development  authorities  within  the  municipal  planning  context.  These  authorities  oversee  regulatory  planning,  real  estate  development  and  housing  and  public  works  functions.  Their  policies  bypass  local  authorities  and  ultimately,  monopolize  development  decisions.  The  Karachi  Development  Authority  (KDA)13,  Dhaka  Development  Authority  (RAJUK)14,  and  Mumbai  Development  Authority  (MDA)15  are  all  provincial/state  government  entities  whose  development  priorities  supersede  municipal  offices  and  bylaws.  I  will  examine  the  role  of  these  development  authorities  against  the  institutional  landscapes  of  each  mega  city  in  later  chapters.  National  institutional  landscapes  aside,  each  of  the                                                                    
13

 The KDA was established to replace the Karachi Improvement Trust and coordinate the sale of state owned land to private development.  After being merged with the City District Government in 2002, it has now been reinstated under the jurisdiction of the provincial government  (www.kda.gos.pk). The divergence between the institutional mandates of the KDA and KWSB have contributed to the poor state of  infrastructure (Sohail and Ahmed, 2003). While the province subsidizes electricity to the KWSB, the KDA does not coordinate planning activities  or support revenue recovery of the water utility, leaving it perpetually reliant on the province for financial assistance.  14  RAJUK was established to replace the Dhaka Improvement Trust and coordinate all development planning and the necessary controls. Their  board includes several directors from the major service delivery departments including DWASA (www.rajukdhaka.gov.bd).  However, their  mandate did not address the multiple departments and duplications of bureaucracy that influence Dhaka's development landscape. Over time,  planning has remained disorganized and real estate markets have outpaced state controls (Islam, 2005).    15  The MDA or MMRDA was established by the state government to direct infrastructure investment and promote the long term growth of  Mumbai (www.mmrda.maharashtra.gov.in). However, over time it has become clear that housing continues to be unaffordable for the masses  and insufficient infrastructure is being overwhelmed by population and polarization (Pinto, 2008). 

36   

development authorities allocate substantially more resources to the planning and capital investment of  new  private  development  rather  than  the  public  responsibilities  of  operations  and  maintenance  of  municipal infrastructure (Siddiqui, 2004). In the absence of municipal leadership from the province/state  governments,  development  continues  from  the  upper  tiers  of  government  while  responsibilities  for  maintenance  are  downloaded  to  lower  tier  municipal  departments  without  the  necessary  resources.  Given the number of departments with overlapping mandates and misaligned reporting structures, `true  devolution'  is  nonexistent  across  all  South  Asian  jurisdictions.  In  any  event,  it  is  important  to  focus  on  the  condition  of  the  lower  tiers  of  the  state,  and  explore  their  capability  and  potential  to  engage  the  marginalized informal sector.  In  terms  of  the  nation  state,  pressure  from  insurmountable  debt  has  compelled  polarized  state  structures  to  accept  Neoliberalism,  encouraging  capitalism  to  flourish  while  their  own  people  suffer  (Amin,  2011).  Neoliberalism  has  also  transformed  multilateral  institutions  which  once  advocated  on  behalf  of  developing  states  (MGI,  2012;  Cleaver,  2008).16  Neoliberal  policy  designs  have  led  to  policies  and  programs  developed  to  encourage  the  growth  of  the  consumer  class,  as  advocated  for  by  range  of  city  development  organizations  and  indicators  (PWC,  2010).  Despite  a  history  of  misplaced  urban  comparisons,  there  is  little  recognition  of  the  need  to  orient  policies  more  equitably  across  the  city.  Inequities  in  the  informal  sector  are  increasing  in  tandem  with  globalization  (HarrisWhite,  2003).  A  country's  bond  rating  goes  up  with  rising  stock  prices,  signaling  the  accumulation  of  capital  by  fewer  elites,  the  demise  of  traditional  sectors  and  lowerpaid  occupations.  Evidence  reveals  that  many  provincial  and  national  leaders  ignore  these  local  concerns,  even  though  many  had  previously  served  as  mayors  of  large  cities  for  long  periods  (Shivakumarakrishnan,  1999).  While  upper  tier  state  actors  express  their  economic  interests  outside  formal  policy  processes17  lower  tier  functionaries  are  confined  to local administrative settings and underfunded departments.

 United Nations agencies are wellknown for their support of developing country administrations by building capacity and developing  consensus on important issues (e.g., UNCTAD Â­ trade and development, UNEP Â­ environmental issues, ILO Â­ labour rights and work). Over time,  the UN has been underfunded and marginalized politically, which has led to a multilateral void in terms of institutional support for developing  country administrations.  17  Many upper tier actors also have land holdings, and appropriate public assets for their own gain. I will discuss this in later chapters. 

37   

In  light  of  the  politicized,  patronclient  relations  wielded  by  upper  tiers  of  the  state  and  the  subservient  challenges  faced  by  lower  tier  functionaries,  local  governments  in  these  countries  have  not  existed  in  the true elected and operational sense. A politicized and patronclient condition creates an environment  of  corruption  and  malgovernance  that  is  beyond  the  control  of  departments  that  already  suffer  from  underfunding. Ultimately, lower tier departments are tied to the people for their survival. Contemporary  development research reveals that locallevel agents of the state assume roles in facilitating civilsociety  led  initiatives  to  engage  the  informal  sector  (Devas,  2005;  Siddiqui  et  al.,  2004).  Frontline  `streetlevel  bureaucrats'  who  straddle  their  capacities  in  both  state  and  society  can  facilitate  engagement  with  the  informal  sector  by  compelling  state  programs  to  engage  marginalized  groups.  Within  the  context  of  these  research  findings,  categorizing  lower  state  functionaries  as  part  of  the  capitalist  `bureaucracy'  is  problematic.  The  lower  tiers  of  the  state,  which  are  the  most  directly  engaged  with  the  informal  sector,  are  marginalized  and  treated  as  punishment  posts  (Cheema  and  Mohmand,  2003;  Siddiqui,  2005).  The  agency  of  the  locallevel  street  bureaucrat  needs  to  be  treated  separately  from  mainstream  critical  theories about the state.18   Based  on  the  findings  described  above,  the  role  of  the  streetlevel  bureaucrat  needs  to  be  assessed  in  terms  of  capacity  and  capability.  Research  inspired  by  Habermas  assesses  in  light  of  accountability  and  transparency)  how  streetlevel  bureaucrats  influence  program  development  and  management  as  they  deal  with  daytoday  cases  (Piore,  2010;  Brodkin,  2008).  In  some  developing  countries,  evidence  suggests  that  agency  cultures  have  adapted  to  changing  organizational  relationships,  engaging  `client  groups'  using  distinctly  unWeberian  methods  (Crook  and  Ayee,  2006;  Wade  1992).  There  is  a  need  to  look  at  how  street  level  policy  is  implemented  through  alternative  management  approaches  (Brodkin,  2011).  Evidence  from  urban  Pakistan  (water/sanitation  and  housing/shelter)  reveals  the  facilitating  role  that  autonomous  state  and  nonstate  actors19  play  in  replicating  selfhelp  development  models  from  one  community  to  another  (Siddiqui,  2005;  Zaidi,  2008).  Evidence  shows  that  state  and  nonstate                                                                    
18

 The sociopolitical dynamics within the 'subaltern group' are also worth exploring in relation to Gramsci's notion of the organic, 'revolutionary  minded intellectuals' who should develop from the working class (Hoare and Smith, 1971). If 'classconscious' state actors (in some contexts, I  would argue, bureaucrats from lowerranking posts) engage with civil society and advocate for the poor, their social location relative to  communitybased activists must be reconsidered.  19 Civil society actors are within the NGO/CBO community, while civic society actors are within the bureaucracy. 

38   

cooperation  is  possible  through  streamlined,  in  situ,  streetlevel  `onewindow'  approaches  to  service  delivery.  However,  a  lack  of  resources  and  recognition  by  upper  tiers  marginalizes  these  approaches.  Critical  theorists  have  recognized  the  need  from  development  from  below,  to  counter  topdown  mandates  (Gills,  2001).  While  Neoliberalism  has  traumatized  and  led  to  the  restructuring  of  the  developing  state,  it  has  also  irrevocably  affected  the  social  and  economic  balance  of  urban  and  rural  development  across  South  Asia  and  the  Global  South.  I  now  turn  to  the  discussion  of  this  issue  in  the  final body of literature that frames my research study. 

2.3 Development Studies
A  growing  body  of  research  has  explored  alternative  models  of  service  delivery  to  marginalized  groups  across the Global South and South Asia (Najania, 2010; Mitlin, 2001; Banuri et al., 2002). Research about  how  communities  organize  to  engage  the  state  and  access  services  can  inform  frameworks  of  state  and  nonstate engagement and encourage inclusive development (Coleman, 1988; McGregor, 2008; Putnam,  2000; Roy, 2011). When civil society actors value collective benefits, replace `I' with `we,' form networks,  and demonstrate how social income and revenue can be generated by communities; they serve as active  facilitators  of  statecommunity  engagement  (Krishna  and  Uphoff,  1997).  This  final  subsection  surveys  the  development  studies  literature  for  the  role  played  by  nonstate  actors  in  facilitating  service  delivery  to the informal sector. I begin with an overview of how nonstate actors are analyzed and continue with  an assessment of the different disciplinary agendas that have shaped these findings and how they affect  perceptions  about  nonstate  actors.  I  conclude  by  exploring  the  current  state  of  research  on  nonstate  actors  that  are  engaging  in  service  delivery  and  their  separation  from  state  actors  in  an  era  of  Neoliberalism.  My  categorization  of  the  development  studies  literature  is  based  on  a  postcolonial  studies understanding of development, not of Marxist approaches.   Neoliberalism  has  irreversibly  altered  the  distribution  of  labour  across  the  Global  South.  It  has  also  constrained  the  human  development  of  large  segments  of  developing  societies.  Firstly,  market  led  industrialization has increasingly focused on manufacturing and export led growth in urban centres. As a  result,  development  policy  making  and  support  has  neglected  fragile,  state  dependent  agricultural  sectors.  As  villages  and  rural  economies  experience  the  effects  of  `anti  rural'  and  `anti  agricultural'  policies, unemployment and impoverishment drives rural labourers to precarious employment in rapidly  industrializing  cities  (Bello,  1999).  Second,  the  mechanization  of  agriculture  has  replaced  farm  workers  with  tractors  and  capital  intensive  modes  of  agricultural  inputs.  This  too,  has  driven  unemployed  rural  39   

labour  to  urban  centres  (Davis,  2006).  Third,  the  `green  revolution'  and  the  widespread  adoption  of  irrigation  practices  to  support  cash  crops,  has  altered  the  composition  of  rural  agricultural  sectors.   Capital intensive irrigation projects, tied to export led growth, has led to the concentration of productive  lands  within  larger  land  holdings.  The  combined  effects  of  the  `green  revolution'  and  the  mechanization  of  agricultural  have  left  many  small  landowners  unable  to  compete  in  the  new  agroeconomy.  After  being  forced  to  sell  their  land,  these  small  landowners  have  migrated  to  cities  in  pursuit  of  economic  opportunities.20  Similarly,  seasonal  rural  labourers  have  established  more  permanent  informal  settlements  across  the  urban  and  periurban  fringes  of  city  centres  due  to  falling  rural  employment  opportunities21.  Researchers  have  noticed  that  as  subsequent  generations  make  these  periurban  informal  settlements  their  home,  their  identity  with  their  home  villages  diminishes  and  they  associate  themselves  with  the  host  city.  Taken  together,  these  migrants  provide  a  flexible,  elastic  pool  of  inexpensive  labour  for  the  formal  urban  economy.  Unfortunately,  despite  the  sheer  mass  of  migrant  labour,  the  `informal  sector'  is  subjected  to  deplorable  working  conditions  as  compared  with  other  developing economies (GCIF, 2000; MUH HDC, 2011).   South  Asia's  mega  cities  have  struggled  more  with  rural  to  urban  migration  and  highdensity  urbanization  as  compared  to  other  mega  cities  across  the  global  South.  Informal  settlements  expanded  in  South  Asia's  cities  in  the  mid1970s  as  a  result  of  sharp  increases  in  ruraltourban  migration  (Bhagat,  2011;  Narayana,  2010).  The  surge  in  internal  migration  was  driven  by  the  adverse  effects  of  the  `green  revolution,' the mechanization of agriculture, and the establishment of exportprocessing zones in South  Asia's  larger  cities  (McMichael,  2008).  In  the  1980s,  continued  neglect  of  agricultural  policy,  along  with  the  market  dictates  of  multilateral  economic  and  financial  interests,  further  marginalized  rural  development,  displacing  labour  markets  and  exacerbating  already  overwhelming  levels  of  urbanization  (BanerjeeGuha,  2009;  Mellor,  1991;  Mukherji,  2001;  UN  Habitat,  2007).  The  encroachment  of  informal  settlements and their modest economic activities (fuelled by the informal sector) has followed industrial

 There is a continuing policy debate on interventions to resuscitate rural livelihoods and economies, in light of climate change and food  insecurity. I do not seek to engage this debate here, but only point out that migration to urban centres is not irreversible at the national levels  of policy intervention.  21  This trend is in contrast to the previous practise of returning regularly to their home town or village in rural heartlands.

and  commercial  development  and  has  spilled  over  into  servicebased  activity.  In  the  absence  of  realistic  planning,  the  spontaneous,  clusterbased  concentration  of  informal  sector  activity  has  contributed  to  the ad hoc nature of municipal zoning. However, this regulatory environment has been undermined by a  more  organized  hijacking  of  formal  developments,  the  majority  of  which  is  done  by  crime  syndicates  of  land  grabbers  (Davis,  2008).22  These  criminal  networks  are  able  to  bypass  weak  municipal  zoning  rules  and  `bylaws'  and  appropriate  public  land  occupied  by  informal  settlements.  Because  the  poor  lack  organizational  and  political  clout,  their  ad  hoc  economic  activities  and  settlements  are  often  blamed  in  onesided analyses of the repercussions of encroachment, such as pedestrian and vehicle congestion.23  All three countries have simultaneously experienced the uncontrolled growth of the informal sector and  its  neglect  by  policy  makers  and  actors24.  In  India,  an  estimated  ninety  three  percent  of  the  population  resides within the informal sector (SDI, 2010).25 Economic policymakers celebrate increases in corporate  earnings,  rising  investment,  and  steady  GDP  growth,  despite  the  deplorable  working  conditions  of  migrant  labourers  (Siddiqui,  2008;  ILO,  2008;  PILER,  2004).  An  estimated  fifty  seven  percent  of  India's  urban  labourers  earn  below  minimum  wage  and  are  subject  to  working  hours  that  exceed  the  average  eight  hours  as  outlined  by  labour  laws  (MukherjeeReid,  2010).  Working  conditions  in  Pakistan's  informal  sector  are  also  deplorable,  as  enforcement  of  existing  labour  legislation  has  been  nonexistent  (Ayub, 2008). Policy research on Bangladesh's informal sector has highlighted the exclusion of the sector  from  the  country's  economic  prosperity  (Siddiqui,  2006).  Bonded  and  child  labour  is  still  observed  throughout  the  region,  as  poor  households  mobilize  available  labour  to  meet  the  rising  costs  of  basic  necessities (Save the Children, 2011; PILER, 2010).

 In the absence of transparent and robust institutional frameworks for land use zoning, development and regulation, illegal developments  have sprouted across the urban landscape. For example, consortiums of public and private officials will violate, bypass and exploit processes  and procedures in order to appropriate public lands. Once title has been illegally obtained, they will then arrange for service connections and  further integration with utilities to prepare the property for sale.  23  Formal development which is ad hoc, often results in the densification of urban areas beyond previously 'designed' or 'intended' carrying  capacities. Due to the political and economic profile of real estate interests and actors, their disregard for municipal planning is rarely called  into question. While it is not the focus of our study (although it appears in the water and sanitation research context), it must be recognized  that failures in informal ad hoc planning are the result of a complex range of forces, of which the informal sector is only one component.  24  The informal sector grew as a result of rural to urban migration and the establishment of informal settlements across growing mega cities. I  will discuss the emergence of the informal sector in each of the countries in more detail in the results chapters.  25  The informal sector in these studies encompasses informal sector labour that is employed as entrepreneurs and standalone proprietorships  as well as informal labour which are employed by the formal sector in poor conditions. My study does not intend to conduct an exhaustive  analysis of these definitions and their applications. Rather, I only point to these figures as an indicator of its relentless growth.

The  result  of  unchecked  rural  to  urban  migration  has  been  the  reproduction  of  urban  poverty.  The  industrialization  of  cities  perpetuates  the  cycle  of  rural  labour  shortages  by  attracting  more  migrants  with  the  `perceived'  promise  of  work  (Fava,  1968).  This  trend  has  been  experienced  across  the  continent.  Asia's  `rise'  has  stemmed  from  large  municipalities  witnessing  economic  growth  well  beyond  the  capacities  of  existing  service  delivery  machinery  (ADB,  2012).  Social  development  programs  are  rare  and  migrant  labourers  are  left  in  deplorable  working  and  living  conditions.  Human  development  goals  are  left  to  the  outputs  of  `trickledown'  economic  growth  (MUH  HDC,  2000).  Weak  local  government  frameworks  and  poorly  supported  institutions  have  been  incapable  of  ensuring  the  equitable  distribution of service delivery (Angotti, 2006; Rakodi, 2002).   Population  forecasts  suggest  that  over  the  next  decade,  several  of  South  Asia's  medium,  large,  and  megacities  will  experience  the  greatest  rates  of  urban  growth  and  service  demand  (UN  Habitat,  2003).  As a result, many of the larger cities, and especially megacities, will evolve into `meta cities' (populations  over  20  million),  characterized  by  urban  corridors  and  regional  economic  clusters  (see  Appendices).  Continuous  migration  and  the  resulting  overwhelming  social  and  economic  activity  will  polarize  urban  citizenry  as  marketbased  approaches  to  development  continue  to  dominate  the  urban  development  policy  context  (Laquian,  2006).  Similarly,  the  tenuous  relationship  between  the  state  and  informal  settlements will persist as both stakeholders have a permanent status within the urban context (Bhagat,  2005).  While  urban  growth  is  celebrated  as  part  of  national  development  (McKinsey  et  al.,  2008),  the  adverse  effects  are  being  felt  across  South  Asia's  largest  municipal  government  departments  and  agencies  (Siddiqui  et  al.,  2004;  Bose,  1992).  The  numbers  of  informal  settlements26  and  informal  sector  labourers  are  also  expected  to  rise,  as  space  becomes  physically  and  economically  scarce  (The  Economist,  2007).  I  will  return  to  a  discussion  of  these  factors  later  on  in  this  dissertation.   Now  let  me  turn to the administrative context that is the geographic focus of my dissertation and a discussion of the  informal settlements and its relationship with the informal sector as a whole.

 Evidence from census data and localized surveys has pointed to an overall slowdown in the growth of slums. However, it may be argued that  this trend highlights the critical mass which slum and low income area dwellers have reached as a result of migration. Low income areas may  have 'pucka' (brick or solid) walls while still being vulnerable to evictions and demolition in the face of rising land values. For this reason, we  combine both groups together as vulnerable and in need of basic service extension and recognition within urban policy frameworks.

The development studies literature has under represented the specific roles and responsibilities of state  and nonstate actors in delivering services to the informal sector. To date, urban poverty continues to be  understated  for  a  variety  of  factors  and  when  `poor  data'  is  used  to  inform  poorlythoughtout  policy  prescriptions, the challenges facing lower tier state and nonstate actors increases (Satterthwaite, 2007).  Research  at  the  national  levels  has  insisted  on  the  employing  `welfare  state'  elements  for  South  Asian  governance  (Palis,  2001).  At  the  upper  tiers,  the  roles  of  the  public  sector  in  contrast  to  donor  institutions  has  yet  to  be  defined  as  part  of  decentralization  programs  (Romeo,  2003;  WB,  1999;  Brookings,  2012).  While  comparative  studies  across  cities  exist,  very  little  research  has  focused  on  administration  and  management  at  these  lower  tiers  (Memon  et  al,  2006).  This  is  despite  the  long  held  recognition of civil society engagement of local CBOs and poor communities.  Dynamics are complex and  more  research  is  required  beyond  the  simplistic  steps  of  guide  books  and  best  practices  manuals  that  lack  political  and  economic  context  (Mitlin,  2001).  Few  scholars  have  explored  the  benefits  and  trade offs  involved  in  arrangements  between  state  and  nonstate  actors,  given  the  structural  constraints  and  environment  of  distrust  (Batley  and  McLoughlin,  2010).  Many  Southbased  commentators  also  point  to  the  need  for more  SouthSouth  comparisons  that  examine  governance  arrangements  from  a  developing  city  perspective.  To  this  end,  there  is  a  need  for  more  SouthSouth  comparisons  on  municipal  programs  and  arrangements  that  formalize  nonstate  engagement.  Unfortunately,  most  development  studies  research  involves  methodologies  borrowed  from  nonadministrative  fields  such  as  development  economics,  the  result  of  upper  tier  research  agendas  and  export  led  development  models.  Calls  for  SouthSouth  governance  and  administration  comparisons  are  ignored  as  policy  audiences  turn  their  attention  to  private  led  development  models  and  solutions.  Despite  the  influence  of  neoliberalism  on  urban  policy  thinking,  most  experts  in  the  field  still  point  to  the  critical  role  of  the  state  to  provide  for  those  suffering  from  poor  human  development  (Haq,  1999;  Sen,  2008).  Where  a  gap  in  state  services  has  been  noticed,  civil  society  has  been  recognized  at  least  as  an  interim  advocate  for  the  informal  sector. Let us now turn to the experiences of these nonstate actors in the next subsection.

2.3.1

Isolated successes in the field

The  role  of  civil  society  in  engaging  the  urban  poor27  and  arranging  for  access  to  services  from  the  state  has been documented through case studies (Haque, 2004; Banuri et al., 2002). Unfortunately, this group  of  advocates  for  the  poor  have  not  had  much  influence  in  the  policydevelopment  process  or  urban  program reforms28 (Laquian, 2005; Burra, 2005). In Karachi, civil society actors await the revival of lower  tier state  departments and political  changes in order to implement policies and programs specific  to the  informal  sector  (Siddiqui,  2005;  Zaidi,  2008).  A  similar  situation  exists  in  Mumbai,  where  evictions  of  slum  communities  continue  despite  years  of  lobbying  by  civil  society  actors  to  housing  authorities  (Burra,  2005;  Raman,  2011).  Clearly,  the  mobilization  of  communities  by  civil  society  need  not  be  solely  for  political  purposes;  it  must  involve  administrative  functioning  in  an  effort  to  extend  services  and  strengthen  communities  (Hasan,  Patel  and  Satterthwaite,  2005).  In  order  to  invert  the  relationship  between  formal  and  informal  sectors  which  subsidize  the  elite  with  cheap  and  unprotected  labour,  increased  engagement  between  state  and  nonstate  actors  will  be  required  to  address  marginalization  and encourage some level of human development  and service delivery (Amin, 2011; Gills, 2001).   Development  studies  research  has  documented  successful  efforts  of  state  and  nonstate  actors  across  the  Global  South  (Tostensen  et  al.,  2001;  Rook  and  Ayre,  2006).  Fewer  alternative  service  delivery  experiences  have  been  profiled  in  South  Asia  (Martin,  2004;  Siddiqui,  2005;  Chowdhury,  2011).  Pilot  projects  abound,  but  limited  oversight  and  no  process  for  engaging  nonstate  actors  has  been  established.  Meanwhile,  civil  society  organizations  are  facilitating  the  extension  of  services  to  the  informal  sector  in  cooperation  with  lower  tier  state  actors  in  areas  such  as  water  and  sanitation  (Sansom,  2006).  The  analysis  of  civil  society  pilot  projects  and  public  service  reforms  across  Asia  points  to  opportunities  of  shifting  governance  to  local  programs.  (Raagman  and  Robinson,  2006).  Although  there  has  been  considerable  documentation  of  civil  society  successes  within  market  settings  and  through MNC aligned business models, very little assessment of the requisite program design and policy  implications  has  been  conducted  (Prahalad,  2004).  Based  on  these  findings,  states  still  do  not  appear  to

 Civil society actors (locallevel CBOs), with the assistance of NGOs demand the provision of services on behalf of poorer communities.    Foreign NGOs appear everywhere, with country and regional offices. Most of these INGOs are advocates rather than service facilitators 

44   

fully  understand  the  potential  of  engaging  both  the  informal  sector  and  nonstate  actors  in  socioeconomic  development.  This  may  be  due  to  the  widespread  skepticism  in  the  industry  and  perception  that  nonstate  actors  are  aiming  to  displace  the  state  (Zaidi,  1999).  Furthermore  the  state  may  also  be  signaling  its  desire  to  control  and  manage  the  increasingly  influential  nonprofit  sector  (Sidel,  2005).  This  is  understandable  given  evidence  that  the  state  may  be  more  effective  in  service  delivery  than  the  nonstate  sector  (Kundu,  2011;  Mansuri  and  Rao,  2004)  and  the  commercialization  of  various  nonstate  actors  (Mitlin,  2001;  WB,  2009).  Informing  this  body  of  literature  about  the  roles  of  informal  sector  and  lower  tier  actors  will  be  valuable  to  policies  that  extend  service  delivery  in  mega  cities.  Neoliberalism  has  had  irrevocable  consequences  on  service  delivery  contexts  across  the  subcontinent.  As  antirural  policies  pushed  migrant  labourers  to  urban  centres,  urban  service  delivery  has  been  overwhelmed.  Upper  tier  policies,  preoccupied  with  industrialization  and  the  concentration  of  power  in  the  hands  of  capitalists,  have  neglected  lower  tier  realities.  The  result  has  been  the  systematic  withdrawal  of  the  state  from  service  delivery  to  growing  segments  of  urban  society.  Over  time,  service  delivery  has  become  polarized  between  wealthier,  formal  settlements  and  informal  settlements.  The  gap  in  service  delivery  to  the  informal  settlements  has  been  filled  by  a  number  of  nonstate  actors.  A  range of multilateral institutions, private donors, nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and community  based  organizations  (CBOs)  have  inserted  themselves  into  development  contexts.  Over  time,  service  delivery  shortfalls  across  the  different  mega  cities  have  been  filled  on  an  ad  hoc  basis  by  nonstate  actors  which  may  inevitably  exclude  public  sector  agencies  or  reduce  them  to  being  subservient  to  neoliberal  development.  As  donorfunded  civil  society  projects  compensate  for  inadequate  service  delivery  machinery  to  the  poor  at  the  lower  tiers  of  the  state,  higher  tiers  of  government  avoid  addressing the social and structural realities and providing resources to lower tiers, perpetuating service  delivery  polarization  (Cleaver,  2001;  Tandon  et  al.,  2001;  Farazmand,  2002).  The  cycle  is  perpetuated  as  the  comparative  `low  wage'  advantage  of  the  industrializing  city  is  fed  by  migrant  workers.    Growing  informal  settlements  with  no  accommodation  or  access  to  basic  services  then  results.  Although 

45   

scholarship  on  private  sector  supply  chain  management  has  been  well  received,  process  improvements  to administrative machinery have received little attention.29    The  limited,  isolated  successes  of  nonstate  actors  have  revealed  differences  in  approaches  to  service  delivery across a range of nonstate (civil society actors). Critical views of nonstate actors abound across  the  development  studies  literatures  which  point  to  the  flaws  of  development  thinking,  propagated  largely by larger, upper tier nonstate actors such as NGOs and INGOs. These upper tier nonstate actors  have  often  embraced  large  scale,  private  sector  led  solutions  to  service  delivery  opportunities  with  little  in  the  way  of  funding  or  sustainment.  For  example,  marketsavvy  donordriven  INGOs  appropriate  development  contexts  and  policy  discussions  from  `selfhelp'  and  indigenous  NGOs  through  foreign  funded  resources  and  networks.  These  forces  have  influenced  international  policy  forums,  drawing  attention away from lower tier concerns (Satterthwaite, 2001). It should be noted at this juncture, that I  will  not  be  expanding  on  the  influence  of  these  upper  tier  nonstate  actors  on  the  'development  industry'  and  the  policy  landscape  of  municipal  governance.  My  research  is  primarily  concerned  with  understanding  the  intricate  relationships  which  have  formed  between  lower  tier  state  and  nonstate  actors  in  the  context  of  policy  formation  and  how  policy  is  or  is  not  implemented.  Regarding  lower  tier  efforts,  sustained  pressure  on  the  administration  of  service  delivery  is  needed  to  counterbalance  the  deviations  and  unsustainable  costs  of  topdown  policy  initiatives  (Wegelin  and  Borghan,  2001).  Lower  tier  nonstate  actors  fill  in  the  shortfalls  by  mobilizing  informal  sector  communities  and  developing  smaller  scale  initiatives  to  support  infrastructure  extension.  Unfortunately,  these  alternative  models  at  the  lower  tiers,  allow  the  upper  tier  nonstate  (and  state)  actors  to  avoid  addressing  institutional  restructuring  challenges.  This  in  turn,  perpetuates  service  delivery  polarization  (Cleaver,  2001;  Tandon  et al., 2001; Farazmand, 2002).   

                                                                  
29

 Development thinking leans towards private sector efficiencies, while neglecting the examination of public service delivery effectiveness.  New public management approaches push for the unbundling of state services while avoiding the analysis of gaps and shortfalls. The short  sightedness of such thinking is evident in the pattern of 'remunicipalisation' of water utilities across the global South. Similarly, the failure to  recognize the integral nature of informal sector labour as part of the Globalizing Urban South's comparative advantage, leads to their eviction.  The relationship with sustainment will be expanded on later. 

46   

Cooperation  between  state  and  nonstate  actors  has  been  documented  within  specific  urban  service  delivery contexts, such as water and sanitation (Sansom, 2006). The policy literature also documents the  establishment  of  service  delivery  networks,  highlighting  the  critical  role  of  lower  tiers  of  the  state  in  engaging  the  urban  poor.  Multilateral  stakeholders  are  once  again  promoting  the  need  for  capacity  building,  as  part  of  a  retooled  new  institutionalism  based  agenda  that  previously  ignored  municipal  development  (ADB,  2008).  Administrative  development  evidence  suggests  that  the  lower  tiers  of  the  state  are  better  positioned  to  engage  the  urban  poor  than  programs  situated  at  upper  tiers  of  the  state  (Shaheen,  2009).  Researchers  have  identified  differences  in  motivations  between  upper  tier  stakeholders  (policy  formalism  and  `votes  for  services')  and  lower  tier  actors,  which  are  tied  to  funding  at national and provincial levels of government (Farazmand, 2002; Heady, 1998).   The various service delivery outcomes that have resulted from the engagement of lower tier state actors  with  civil  society  organizations  warrant  comparative  research  and  examination.  Lessons  from  the  experiences  of  megacities  and  their  struggles  with  neoliberalism  can  inform  policy  and  management  frameworks  for  cooperation  between  state  and  nonstate  actors.  In  order  to  further  define  and  situate  my study, I now survey this literature as represented from the perspective of the Global South.  

2.4 Informal Settlements, Neoliberalism and the Global South
The  economic  contribution  of  the  informal  sector  has  been  discussed  within  the  development  literature  and  deserves  special  attention.  The  contributions  of  the  informal  sector  have  been  understated  in  early  work  by  DeSotto,  Turner,  and  others.  More  recently,  a  number  of  development  economists  have  unpacked  the  `capabilities'  and  `capacities'  of  the  urban  poor  to  develop  on  their  own  terms  (Sen  and  Dreze, 1998). The social rehabilitation of the informal sector through improving their settlements seems  to  be  an  effective  set  of  interventions  for  human  development.  In  economic  terms,  simply  enabling  the  urban  poor  seems  to  be  the  most  efficient  approach  for  their  development.  Sen's  lectures  on  commodities  and  capabilities  outline  such  an  approach.  Having  long  challenged  the  traditional  notions  of  opulence  (based  on  real  incomes)  as  well  as  utility  (possessing  choice,  obtaining  happiness  or  fulfillment),  Sen  (2005)  repackaged  the  measures  of  human  choice  and  ability,  arguing  that  the  real  measure  must  be  of  what  a  person  can  do  and  can  be  through  `wellbeing'  and  `advantage'.  A  person's  `functioning' (what a person does with the commodities and capabilities at hand) and his/her `valuation'  (that  which  is  held  in  high  regard  by  the  individual  or  society)  require  addressing  at  the  policy  level:  47   

one's  ability  to  make  decisions  is  affected  by  one's  immediate  environment  (Dreze  and  Sen,  2008).  The  valuation of the informal sector is intricately tied to Neoliberalism.  Neoliberalism has exacerbated the formation of informal settlements since the end of colonialism. A key  input  to  capitalism  across  developing  countries,  informal  sector  labour  has  provided  lower  costs  and  depth of capacity to the industries and economic bases of their host mega cities. This displaced segment  of  labour  subsists  by  working  under  irregular  working  conditions  with  no  benefits,  lower  rates  of  remuneration,  and  no  safety  protocols  or  implemented  labour  laws.  Informal  sector  labour  also  allows  urban  industries  to  engage  in  import  substitution  and  replacement  without  incurring  the  requisite  costs  associated with basic service provision and social development of the working class (Davis, 2008). Urban  industries  are  thus  able  to  maintain  a  flexible,  elastic  labour  force  while  avoiding  the  costs  associated  with  ensuring  the  provision  of  adequate  publicly  supplied  services  (Portes,  1996;  Davis,  2006).  Underpaid  employees  of  formal  sector  firms  also  employ  informal  sector  labourers  in  various  services  such  as  food  services,  clothing  and  transportation.  This  buoys  the  livelihoods  of  formal  sector  labourers  with  amenities  that  they  might  otherwise  be  unable  to  afford.  Local  industry  is  provided  with  hourly/piecemeal wages as needed, without the  costs of paying benefits or taxes that would resuscitate  a  poor  and  marginalized  labour  class.  Clearly,  the  ample  supply  of  informal  sector  labour  contributes  to  increased productivity and profits that drive urban economies.   Despite  their  contribution  to  urban  industries,  their  contribution  is  not  recognized  by  the  state  or  market.  In  fact,  public  and  private  authorities  occasionally  seek  to  eliminate  the  informal  settlements  that  spring  up  across  megacities  as  informal  labourers  struggle  to  cope  with  the  lack  of  housing  (Stokes,  1962;  Mangin  &  Turner,  1968;  Perlman,  1976).  Shortages  of  housing,  water,  sanitation,  waste  management,  transportation  and  other  basic  services  burden  urban  `carrying  capacity'  and  fragile  service  delivery  mechanisms  (UN  Habitat,  2011).  The  result  is  the  emergence  of  private  `payperuse'  models,  which  displace  public  service  delivery.  As  the  wealthy  are  able  to  pay  for  services,  the  poor  are  left  to  cope  with  alternatives  or  illegal  access.  Illegal  access  exposes  informal  settlements  to  the  threat  of  eviction.  For  instance,  informal  settlements  which  are  situated  on  land  where  tenure  has  not  been  awarded  to  slum  dwellers  may  be  appropriated  by  developers  once  land  values  rise.  Consequently,  as  public  assets,  wealth,  and  access  to  services  are  captured  and  concentrated  in  elite  networks,  polarization  fuels  conflict  and  social  unrest.  In  order  to  placate  the  informal  sector,  the  state  provides  a  meagre,  temporary  level  of  service  delivery  and  recognition.  Scholars  are  questioning  the  effectiveness  48   

of  such  an  approach  and  the  legitimacy  of  the  institutions  that  sustain  them.  The  effectiveness  of  imported  development  models  is  questioned,  as  years  of  experimentation  have  not  yielded  positive  outcomes or equitable development (Batley & Larbi, 2008).  

2.4.1

Formal-Informal sector dynamics

As  the  informal  sector  underpins  the  productivity  of  urban  economies,  state  interests  should  motivate  the  formulation  of  policies  that  sustain  the  condition  of  flexible  labour.  Development  economists  recommend  that  the  state  combine  the  `identification'  (identifying  who  in  society  is  poor)  and  `aggregation'  (summarizing  the  meanings  of  `urban  poverty')  of  the  informal  sector,  for  the  betterment  of  urban  society  (Sen,  2006).  Although  most  state  actors  are  disconnected  from  urban  society  and  the  informal  sector,  those  at  the  lowest  tiers  are  mandated  with  ensuring  sustained  service  delivery  to  all  citizens  (Laquian,  2008).  In  fact,  it  is  expanding  megacities  which  are  struggling  to  provide  services  to  all  segments  of  society.  Because  mega  city  economies  have  multigovernmental  effects,  their  administrations  should  be  supported  by  intergovernmental  policies  that  encourage  the  delivery  of  basic  services to informal settlements (UN Habitat, 2012). As implementers and administrators of state policy,  the  lowest  tiers  of  the  state  are  best  positioned  to  assess  the  condition  and  context  of  informal  settlements. Unfortunately, there are a number of factors that disable engagement.    Unfortunately,  policy  actors  often  equate  the  informal  sector  and  settlements  with  criminal  activity  and  the  pilferage  of  public  assets.  However,  the  linkage  between  the  two  is  much  more  complex  than  one sided analysis suggests. First, the spread of illegal developments in areas characterized by increased land  values,  are  the  result  of  opportunistic  collusion  and  corruption  among  government  officers.  The  weak  institutional  frameworks  that  permit  such  organized  crime  are  rarely  held  to  account.  Second,  informal  settlements  lack  access  to  basic  services,  despite  ad  hoc  `policy  bandages'  (Civis,  2008).  The  absence  of  basic  services  provides  opportunities  for  organized  criminals  to  exploit  weak  institutional  frameworks.  Building  materials,  water  and  power  are  all  sold  by  criminal  syndicates  at  exorbitant  rates  to  informal  settlement  households.  Third,  political  rhetoric  has  resulted  in  a  short  term  cycle  of  neglect.  Upper  tier  state  actors,  nudged  by  general  strikes  and  media  coverage  of  slum  evictions,  offer  time  bound  support  to  informal  settlements.  This  results  in  short  term  initiatives  being  launched  to  facilitate  slum  upgrades  and rehabilitation. However, many of these `topdown' policies fall short of their intended promises and  fail  to  address  chronic  service  delivery  challenges.  Local  implementing  bodies  and  lower  tiers  of  the  state  are  disengaged  from  these  efforts,  leaving  slum  dwellers  to  find  alternative  (illegal)  access  to  49   

water, sanitation, and shelter. In the meantime, the development lobbies continue to push their agenda,  which results in gentrification drives and uprooting of slum dwellings and informal settlements.  Policy  development  is  further  complicated  by  the  legacy  of  colonialism,  the  proliferation  of  neoliberal  policies  and  extremely  rapid  urbanization.  Colonial  rule  has  left  developing  countries  with  an  elitist,  centre  facing  bureaucracy,  disconnected  from  the  realities  of  lower  income  groups.  Situated  within  the  upper  levels  of  the  state,  a  welleducated  class  of  Anglicized  bureaucrats  has  been  largely  concerned  with  retaining  power  rather  than  implementing  policies  (Alavi,  1972).  These  forces  have  overwhelmed  the  carrying  capacities  of  mega  cities  and  their  ability  to  engage  the  informal  sector.  The  legacy  of  colonial  rule  has  been  that  political  and  economic  interests  dictate  the  policy  priorities  of  national  and  provincial  governments.  Macroeconomic  concerns  divert  support  away  from  dense,  overburdened  municipalities. Neglect by `upper tiers' of the state and declining provincialÂ­municipal resource transfers  is  eroding  `lower  tier'  service  delivery  capacity.  The  result  is  the  polarization  of  access  to  services:  only  those  with  political  connections  and  economic  resources  are  able  to  negotiate  access  to  scarce  municipal  services.  Those  without  the  requisite  political  ties  or  economic  resources  are  confronted  with  scarcity.  This  is  the  situation  faced  by  the  informal  sector,  many  of  which  are  surviving  in  unplanned,  informal  settlements.  Relegated  to  shrinking  public  spaces,  the  informal  sector  struggles  to  meet  basic  needs30.  As  a  result,  its  members  are  unable  to  participate  as  recognized  and  capable  citizens  within  urban  development  (ADB,  2008).    My  primary  objective  is  to  inform  administrative  development  research  about  the  ultimate  responsibility  of  the  state  for  extending  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements.  The  findings  may  contradict  the  neoliberal  trend  of  downsizing  or  trimming  governments;  genuine  social  development  of  South  Asia's  megacities  requires  active  involvement,  coordination,  and  sponsorship by the state.

 Nonstate actors including civil society and donor agencies provide isolated instances of support, which I will explore later on as part of my  research. However, the absence of continuous state support is devastating for the informal sector.

2.4.2

Neoliberalism31 and the Global South

The pressures of globalization, `Neoliberalism', and urbanization continue to be felt across the sprawling  cities  of  the  `Global  South'  (Jack,  2006;  Cornia  and  Court,  2001;  UNDP,  2001).  Neoliberalism  is  most  simply  defined  as  the  spread  of  market  led  policy  development  by  the  privatization  of  the  public  domain.  Since  the  end  of  the  `Cold  War',  several  developing  countries  experimented  with  state  led  development  models.  Stateled  development  or  quasisocialist  policies  were  adopted  across  many  countries  during  the  first  three  or  so  decades  of  decolonization,  but  due  to  a  number  of  external  and  internal  factors,  experienced  limited  success  in  terms  of  social  uplift.  As  capitalism  spread  during  the  postcold  war  global  economy,  U.S.  supremacy  continued  largely  unabated.    During  this  time,  development  models  sidelined  the  role  of  the  state  and  placed  more  emphasis  on  the  role  of  markets.  I  would like to emphasize at this juncture, that I do not intend to expand on how neoliberalism has spread  in  states  as  they  embraced  globalization.  A  theoretical  examination  of  the  relationship  between  neoliberalism  and  the  complexities  of  expanding  developing  city  contexts  is  well  beyond  the  scope  and  resources of this study. My interdisciplinary focus is concerned largely with how neoliberalism manifests  itself  within  the  informal  sector  and  at  different  levels  of  urban  state  and  society.  Industrial  capitalism  has  led  to  the  marketization  of  developing  countries  where  finance  and  export  led  growth  have  dominated  policy  making.  The  policies  of  administrations  in  India,  Pakistan  and  Bangladesh  have  been  shaped  by  neoliberal  thinking,  restructuring  and  deregulation,  and  other  policy  dictates  of  Bretton  Woods' institutions.  The result of market centered policies has been exponential levels of rural to urban  migration as well as urban displacement which in turn has compounded migration. Key works by Harvey  among  others,  regarding  the  'right  to  the  city'  are  engaged  by  my  research  on  the  disparities  between  different  tiers  of  the  state  and  those  which  support  human  development.  As  such,  the  relationship  between capital and labour and various modes of production in so far as these services are concerned is  not  my  main  focus.  Nevertheless,  let  me  briefly  touch  upon  some  of  the  key  manifestations  of  neoliberalism in urban settings which have implications for our theoretical understanding.

 The term 'Global South' is often used in reference to the states and societies of developing countries south of the equator. The term  'Glurbanization' is emerging in the literature as a reference to the simultaneous processes of globalization and urbanization. I use urban  throughout my dissertation, but recognizes the linkages between globalization and urbanization. 

51   

With  respect  to  the  effect  of  neoliberalism  on  inequality,  evidence  from  South  Asia's  mega  cities  links  the  polarizing  development  patterns  of  urbanization  (set  into  motion  by  colonial  rulers)  with  rising  land  values  and  the  crowding  in  of  market  forces  (in  large  cities).  Over  time,  policy  attention  given  to  urban  industrialization  and  rural  mechanization  has  led  to  the  steady  flow  of  informal  sector  labour  (resulting  from  rural  to  urban  migration  and  the  growth  of  slums  and  informal  settlements).  Criminal  interests  (internal  and  external  to  the  state)  have  coalesced  into  a  'land  grabbing  mafia'  which  has  exploited  policy gaps in land planning to appropriate public and private land for development that caters to elites.  At  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum,  the  absence  of  any  effort  by  the  state  to  engage  in  the  human  development  of  rural  migrants  has  led  to  the  exploding  ranks  of  urban  informal  sector  labour.  The  exploitation  of this labour pool and intensification of capitalism has paralleled the policies of developing  economies to leverage the competitive advantages of urban cities32.   Neoliberalism's  anti  agriculture  approach  (a  la  the  GATTWTO)  has  mechanized  agriculture,  driving  labour  from  rural  heartlands  to  ballooning  mega  cities.  In  the  meantime,  the  nation  state  has  neglected  any  efforts  to  resuscitate  social  services  or  capabilities  as  weak  programs  have  been  dismantled  (through  state  restructuring  as  well  as  the  concentration  of  donor  facing  policy  power  in  central  governments) (Farazmand, 1996, 1999, 2002). The only remaining apparatus within central governments  (development  authorities  in  each  of  the  mega  cities)  have  been  refocussed  on  multilateral  institutions,  facilitating market liberalization and unsustainable plans for urban development and modernization. The  combined  pressure  of  these  neoliberal  forces  have  eradicated  any  the  remaining,  albeit  tattered,  social  safety  nets.  So  the  cities  have  become  places,  as  Harvey  says,  for  business  to  grow,  rather  than  for  people  to  develop  (Harvey,  2006).  As  these  mega  cities  and  their  social  services  continue  to  buckle  under  the  pressure  of  migrant  labour,  the  bare  operation  of  municipal  capabilities  caters  mainly  to  the  needs  of  elites  without  engaging  the  steady  supply  of  rural  to  urban  labour.  As  a  result,  lower  tier  services are unable to bridge the gaps between rich and poor, or facilitate any service delivery extension 

                                                                  
32

 The persistent attention given to neoliberal strategies (McKinsey's Mumbai development papers) has eclipsed more community based,  pluralistic discussions of equitable development which result in interactions between broad segments of urban stakeholders (state and non state). I will explore these patterns and gaps within the results chapters for each city and draw out findings from the case studies.

to  the  broader  benefits  of  human  development  across  the  ranks  of  precarious  labour  in  the  informal  sector.  My  research  insists  that  the  study  of  the  urban  precariat  must  be  accompanied  by  representatives  and  sympathizers  in  the  state  and  nonstate  sectors  who  struggle  to  extend  services,  in  the  case  of  my  research,  to  the  informal  sector  and  informal  settlements.  Of  course,  there  are  multiple  layers  and  complexities  that  require  examination  and  research  in  the  complex  socio  economic  settings  of  the  municipal  south,  than  have  been  factored  into  my  analysis33.  Nevertheless  my  research  accompanies  these  observations  and  points  out  that  counter  forces  may  not  emerge  solely  from  the  ranks  of  the  urban  poor,  key  participants  in  'class  struggle'  as  has  been  traditionally  understood.  Conscious  technocrats  (as  illustrated  by  the  range  of  actors  in  the  water  and  sanitation  sector)  who  recognize  the  'human  development  needs'  of  the  informal  sector  and  the  precariat  are  valuable  supporters  in  this  struggle.  My  research points to a separation between elite bureaucrats (who neoliberalism has restored  class  power  to)  in  central  governments  and  less  educated,  lower  class  functionaries  (street  level  bureaucrats)  in municipal  government.  If, as Harvey indicates, this is all about  class struggle,  particularly  in  cities  (be  they  across  the  Global  North  or  South)  theories  about  neoliberalism  must  account  for  differences  across  the  labour  market,  which  he  points  to  in  his  elaborate  discussion  of  the  redistributive  effects  of  neoliberalism  (Harvey,  2006).  For  example,  municipal  departments  who  benefit  from  the  engagement  of  informal  settlements  (although  they  are  held  hostage  to  the  whims  of  local  elites)  must  be  considered  as  partners,  at  least  passive  ones34,  in  the  efforts  to  resuscitate  informal  settlements  and  their  inhabitants.  More  specifically,  municipal  utilities  such  as  water,  benefit  from  direct  engagement  with  communities  and  the  cycles  of  revenue  generation  from  tariffs  and  user  fees.  There  are  also  technocrats  from  municipal  governments  (punishment  posts)  and  members  of  civil  society  who  are  embedded  in  these  informal  settlements  who  advocate  and  negotiate  with  lower  tier  departments  for

 Davis' 'Planet of Slums' provides a rich overview of these forces in urban settings and their situation within the neoliberal policy context.    The interests of this lower tier of state functionaries, due to their marginalization by the upper tiers of the state, are not in line with the  wealth redistribution patterns (privatization, financialization, crises management and upper tier state led redistribution of assets) supported by  the upper tiers of that state and neoliberal apparatus. The lower tier does not benefit from 'accumulation by dispossession', as Harvey states  but more from the equitable distribution of services and human development of all citizens to the benefit or urban infrastructure investment  and sustainment. This difference in interests, combined with the marginalization of the lower tiers, situates these 'street level bureaucrats'  closer socially and politically even, to the informal settlements than elites within the upper tiers of the state.  

53   

the  extension  of  services35.  Their  role  is  in  contrast  to  the  plethora  of  nonstate  actors  which  have  dominated urban development.    It  should  be  noted  that  multilateral  institutions  have  always  played  a  role  in  promising  participation  to  developing  country  governments.  However,  as  researchers  have  pointed  out,  rules  and  policies  have  always  been  tied  to  a  framework  of  U.S.  based  control  (Cox,  1987).  It  is  certainly  arguable  that  proponents  of  Neoliberalism  failed  to  prepare  developing  countries  for  the  after  effects  of  market  centred  policies. Nevertheless, the overall and  continuing subjugation of developing  countries and  cities  by developed countries requires analysis.  Neoliberal policies were implemented without a sufficient understanding of the impacts on urbanization  or  human  development.  Several  studies  on  the  neoliberal  restructuring  of  the  Global  South  has  improved  our  understanding  of  the  challenges  and  dynamics  surrounding  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements.  In  the  absence  of  `state  will',  service  delivery  has  been  contracted  out  to  nonstate  actors  (civil  society)  with  costs  and  benefits  for  urban  economies.  Critical  analysis  of  NGO  efforts  points  to  the  provision  of  a  minimal  level  of  intervention  to  resuscitate  informal  settlements  and  their  inhabitants.  As  Dunk points out, these efforts guarantee the provision of a marginalized, desperate working class that is  without  recourse  or  recourse  for  human  development  (Dunk,  2002).  Along  the  urban  fringe,  many  informal settlements are struggling with access to services, priced as much as ten times the public tariff.  There  are  a  growing  number  of  homeless  informal  sector  workers  who  reside  on  the  streets  as  pavement dwellers.   The  risks  of  disease,  civil  unrest,  pollution,  scarcity  and  insecurity  post  significant  risks  to  urban  society.  As a result, in contrast to Dunk's commentary, nonstate actors are pointing to the active role that lower  tier actors must take in preventing such a tipping point from taking place36. Peck (2004), rightly points to                                                                    
35

 Similarly, these lower tier nonstate actors cannot be treated in the same way as upper tier nonstate actors such as the donors who have  been discussed already. Analysis of their role will emerge in the findings chapters of this dissertation.  36  In this regard, it is relevant to point to the disastrous circumstances that arise from ongoing unrest in Karachi. Civil unrest leads to violent  riots where the public vents their frustrations by damaging public and private property.  In many cases, the target of rioting is the poor state of  transit and ostensibly, buses and other large vehicles. It should be noted that most of the buses in Karachi are owned by private operators. 

54   

the  transnational  nature  of  Neoliberalism.    He  points  out  rightly  that  across  the  literature,  there  is  an  acceptance  that  Neoliberalism  has  not  replaced  the  state,  but  has  in  fact  influenced  the  state  to  accept  market  led  development  through  different  means  of  regulating/policing  market  activities  (Peck,  2004).  According  to  Harvey,  urban  governments  have  been  forced  to  shift  from  managerialism  (providing  services, facilities and benefits) to entrepreneurialism (local development and employment  growth) as a  way  of  retaining  a  position  within  the  neoliberal  state  (Harvey,  1989).  This  brings  the  relationship  between  urban  change  and  economic  development  into  focus  as  developing  states,  go  through  considerable  economic  and  political  instability.  Urbanization  has  helped  to  capture  urban  surpluses.   Many  who  are  dispossessed  live  alongside  the  wealthy  and  affluent  in  what  Davis  refers  to  as  planet  of  slums  (Davis,  2006).  Harvey's  solution  is  more  democratic  control  of  the  surplus  and  democratic  management of the city. The roles played by state and nonstate actors will be explored later on.  The  colonial  legacy  has  most  obviously,  led  to  the  restructuring  of  the  South  Asian  state  and  the  polarization  between  upper  and  lower  tiers  of  government.  Neoliberalism  has  ossified  this  relationship  by  concentrating  economic  and  financial  power  in  the  upper  tiers  of  the  state.  Neoliberal  forces  allow  for  the  imposition  of  top  down  policies  formulated  at  the  upper  tiers  of  the  state  on  lower  tiers.  For  example,  national  and  provincial/state  governments  across  the  region  have  retained  financial  control  over  public  and  private  led  development.  Lower  tier  state  actors  (municipal  governments),  subjected  to  post independence development experiments have continued to struggle with limited capacities and the  effects of Neoliberal policies. The combination of limited state led models, contextless colonial era state  structures  and  severe  climaterelated  events  have  negatively  affected  the  regions  unplanned  mega  cities.37  (Subramaniam,  1990;  Sivakumarakrishnan,  2004;  Parker  et  al.,  2010).  Over  time,  upper  tier  planning  for  South  Asia's  largest  cities  shifted  from  development  projects  to  exportled  growth.  Private  sector  investment  and  development  projects  displaced  state  planning  and  public  sector  projects  with                                                                                                                                                                                                         
However, postriot analysis continues to show that that it is only the few remaining public buses that are torched and set alight. As a result of  such action, the informal transportation industry or road mafia, retains control over its assets and is in fact strengthened. Service continues to  be deplorable, which leads to civil unrest and riots. The cycle then continues.  37   `Context  less,  colonial  structures'  is  a  term  coined  by  Subramaniam  to  describe  legacybased  structures  from  colonial  rule,  and  hierarchical  bureaucracies  with  little  connection  with  the  societies  in  which  they  are  established.  Selfinterest  and  promotion,  as  opposed  to  public  service  and societal engagement, has further distanced institutions from the members of society which the state is mandated with serving.

liberalized,  free  market  policies  (MUH  HDC,  2001).  Initially,  upper  tier  policies  marginalized  agriculture  and  promoted  exportprocessing  zones.  These  policies  elevated  the  political  profile  and  economic  position  of  urban  industry,  perpetuating  the  inflow  of  migrant  labour  (Siddiqui,  2008).  As  private  interests  gathered  strength,  they  overwhelmed  lower  tier  institutions  (already  fraught  with  corruption  and  mismanagement)  resulting  in  further  neglect  (Siddiqui,  2006;  2004).  The  result  has  been  the  privatization  and  transfer  of  lower  tier  state  assets  to  the  private  sector  elite.  The  downtrodden  and  marginalized have been left to improvise in ad hoc urban contexts (Hasan, 2002; Islam, 2006).   Evidence  from  megacities  (including  South  Asia)  has  revealed  how  free  market  development  agendas  have  contributed  to  an  increasingly  polarized  urban  citizenry  (Hasan,  2002;  Islam,  2004;  Siddiqui  et  al.,  2004;  UN  Habitat,  2010).  Rising  land  values  attract  commercial  developers  and  few  provisions  are  made  to  accommodate  the  social  and  economic  activity  of  the  labour  force.  Very  quickly,  existing  infrastructure is overwhelmed by unplanned development, so ad hoc service delivery pathways emerge.  Targeted socially planned lowincome settlements are converted to middle income assets, vulnerable to  volatile  housing  markets.  The  city's  marketdriven  environment  becomes  so  competitive  that  even  well intended  imported  projects,  policy  prescriptions,  and  civil  society  efforts  struggle  in  isolation  to  support  the  informal  sector  (MUH  HDC,  2007).  Imported  projects  are  limited  by  short  life  cycles  as  they  target  specific  groups  without  addressing  the  structural  constraints  to  equitable  development.  Thus,  the  competitive  environment  perpetuated  by  Neoliberalism  continues  to  erode  equitable  development  in  South  Asia's  megacities.  In  the  absence  of  sufficient  municipal  capacities  to  balance  development  outcomes, vast segments of the urban poor are excluded, contributing to a growing informal sector.   As personal or informal regulation increases, formal regulation through the state has advanced in others  ways.  For  instance,  there  are  a  number  of  `vertical  topographies  of  power  above  daily  life  and  community',  which  have  taken  over  the  role  of  the  state  (Ferguson  and  Gupta,  2002).  My  research  will  explore  the  manner  by  which  certain  institutions  have  been  destroyed  and  replaced  by  others,  at  the  expense of human development and service delivery to informal settlements.  

2.4.3

South Asia's Mega Cities and Informality

South  Asian  research  about  informality  speaks  to  the  role  played  by  the  informal  sector  in  economic  development  (Khan  and  Kazmi,  2008;  Bairagya,  2010).  For  example,  informal  sector  labour  supplies  food,  clothing,  and  transportation  services  to  the  broader  labour  market  and  supply  chains  utilized  by  56   

the  formal  sector  (Hasan,  2002;  Islam,  2006).  It  also  provides  flexible,  contracted  labour  and  supplier  services  to  the  formal  sector  during  turbulent  periods  of  economic  activity  (Khan  &  Kazmi,  2008;  Amin,  1987;  Mukherjee,  2002).  In  many  cases,  this  pool  of  labour  provides  mega  city  administrations  with  services  that  bridge  gaps  in  service  delivery.  Informal  sector  productivity  expands  and  contracts  to  mirror  economic  needs  because  it  operates  within  a  transient  social  and  economic  space  (Reza,  2003;  Chaudhuri  &  Yabuuchi,  2007).  It  also  redistributes  wealth  to  rural  areas,  through  remittances  from  migrant  workers,  internally  displaced  peoples  and  informal  sector  labourers  (Seddon,  2004,  Miah  &  Weber,  1991).  Because  the  informal  sector  is  intricately  linked  with  urban  economic  activity,  development economists have long argued that the informal sector should receive state recognition and  rehabilitation  on  this  basis  alone  (Khan  and  Kazmi,  2008;  Chen  et  al.,  1999).  Evidence  from  the  informal  financial  sector  in  Bangladesh  has  been  shown  it  to  serve  the  needs  of  the  poor  much  better  than  the  formal sector (Rahman, A., 1992). Evidence from field studies shown that the poor are capable of saving,  once  the  machinery  to  support  their  financial  behaviour  has  been  provided  (Rutherford,  1998).  In  the  surging  urban  economies  of  Asia,  this  line  of  development  thinking  has  gained  momentum,  so  more  policy discussion about the engagement of marginalized groups in urban areas is required. The dynamics  between formal and informal stakeholders is now turned to in the next subsection.   Despite  its  contribution  to  the  local  economy,  the  informal  sector  continues  to  suffer  from  policy  and  service  delivery  neglect.  Recognition  of  the  informal  settlements  of  South  Asia's  urban  society  is  formal  at  best,  in  so  far  as  national  policies  exist  on  paper  (Farazmand,  1998;  Siddiqui  et  al.,  2004).  Informal  settlements  have  received  support  from  nonstate  actors,  but  successful  outcomes  are  isolated  and  almost  in  light  of  the  swelling  numbers  of  migrant  labourers  (Banuri  et  al,  1999).  State  and  nonstate  actors alike recognize the ultimate responsibility for service delivery lies with state actors.  In  light  of  the  overwhelming  growth  of  informal  settlements  across  South  Asia  it  is  valuable  to  compare  how  state  and  nonstate  actors  extend  services  to  informal  settlements  across  the  region's  megacities.  For  instance,  upper  tiers  of  the  state's  bureaucracy  can  introduce  or  withdraw  resources,  targeted  programs  and  differential  tax  regimes.  The  accumulation  of  wealth  and  the  exercise  of  power  at  these 

57   

upper  tiers  of  the  state  affect  outcomes  at  the  lower  tiers  by  excluding  them  from  the  policy  making  agenda.  Mega  city  administrations  at  the  lower  tiers  of  the  state  are  thus  forced  to  negotiate  their  relationships  with  upper  tiers  of  the  state  as  well  as  donors,  market  players,  civil  society,  and  a  range  of  classbased  communities.38  The  complexity  of  relations  between  upper  and  lower  tier  state  actors  and  informal  settlements  makes  comparisons  between  Dhaka,  Karachi,  and  Mumbai  all  the  more  insightful39.  Global  studies  have  emphasized  the  importance  of  basic  services  as  key  components  of  human  development  (UNDP,  2010).  Evidence  from  South  Asia  has  also  revealed  the  importance  of  basic  services to human development and poverty.   Comparative  research  about  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements  across  South  Asian  megacities  is  necessary  given  the  region's  shared  history  of  colonial  development  and  neocolonial  intervention.  The  subcontinent's  shared  social,  cultural,  religious,  historical,  and  political  context  provides  a  useful  stage  for  national  and  urban  comparison  (Siddiqui  et  al.,  2004;  Bauer,  1956).  Colonialism's  effects  on  the  region's  governmental  structures  (e.g.,  bureaucratic  class  culture,  institutional  hierarchy,  and  political administrative  dichotomies)  have  had  an  irrevocable  impact  on  stateÂ­society  relations  (Subramaniam,  2001;  Haque,  1996).  The  state  cannot  be  taken  as  homogenous;  the  relationships  between  upper  and  lower  tiers  of  state  actors  require  examination.  Studies  conducted  in  African  cities  have  shown  how  vibrant,  indigenously  developed  urban  centres  have  been  replaced  by  topdown,  hierarchical  models  of  governance  imposed  by  colonial  masters  (Myers,  2011).  Clearly,  the  postcolonial  development  of  state  and  city  has  been  influenced  and  dictated  by  foreign  agendas,  multilateral  institutions,  private  sector  interests,  donor  agencies,  and  NGO  mandates.  Collectively,  development  experiments,  foreign  policy  interventions,  and  market  volatility  have  complicated  the  overall  improvement  in  human  development  within  developing  countries  (McMichael,  2008).  Foreign  intervention  has  complicated  inter governmental  processes,  controls,  and  power  relations,  thereby  contributing  to  failed  devolution  and  decentralization  reforms.  The  `resilience'  of  the  informal  settlements  as  well  as  the  informal  sector

 Clearly delineating between upper and lower tiers is a complex undertaking. I use this term not to exclude other meanings of upper and  lower tiers, but only to clarify my understanding and ensure consistency in examination across South Asia's mega city contexts.  39  Water and sanitation service delivery processes and pre requisites share linkages with housing and shelter as well as solid waste management  processes. Where relevant, I will reference findings from these service delivery contexts across the three mega cities. 

58   

within  South  Asia's  mega  cities  compels  the  case  for  comparative  policy  research  at  the  mega  city  level.  In  order  to  frame  the  approach  of  my  research,  I  now  provide  a  brief  overview  of  the  current  themes  in  the interdisciplinary policy literature. 

2.5 Current Themes in Interdisciplinary Research
Comparative  public  administration  research  has  identified  the  limitations  of  imported  development  frameworks  and  asserted  a  research  agenda  for  the  condition  of  local  government  policy  and  program  frameworks40  (Stren,  1994;  Siddiqui  et  al.,  2002).  At  the  national  levels  of  government,  topdown  economic  policies  continue  to  exert  donorfunded  pressure  on  development  plans,  with  gains  funding  the  current  political  regimes  (Umeh  &  Andranovich,  2008;  Rakodi,  2006).  The  costs  are  absorbed  by  the  growing  masses  of  urban  marginalized  labourers,  who  are  excluded  from  formal  development  (Laquian,  2008).  When  social  and  environmental  development  projects  are  proposed  by  multilateral  institutions,  they  fail  to  address  the  overwhelming  structural  problems  within  the  context  of  urban  development  (Satterthwaite,  2006).  In  contrast,  researchers  have  acknowledged  that  effective  reforms  to  developing  states  will  require  approaches  to  reducing  corruption,  along  with  increased  transparency  and  accountability  (Batley  &  Larbi,  2004).  Unfortunately,  few  comparative  analyses  have  focused  on  the  institutions  responsible  for  urban  service  delivery.  Upper  tier  institutions  involved  with  decentralization  and  lower  tier  institutions  mandated  with  basic  service  delivery  require  assessment  from  the  perspective  of  human  development41  (Dwivedi  &  Nef,  1998).  Careful  analysis  of  these  policies  and  institutions  Â­  and  to  distinguish  how  Neoliberalism  inserts  itself  by  pursuing  transparency  and  accountability  demands  without  the  corresponding  attention  to  structures  that  promote  corruption  or  unaccountable  bureaucratic  and  political  decisionmaking  Â­  will  help  clarify  whether  policy  failures  are  the  result  of  poor  formulation  or  development,  legacy  of  colonial  states  structures  or  insufficient  implementation and monitoring resources.                                                                    
40

 In particular, little local research is disseminated and shared broadly with higher tier policy makers in a way that may possibly positively  impact development policies in larger urban centres. Stren's frustration with management replacing planning is apt, given the overwhelming  challenges facing urban centres across the global south where planning, for all intents and purposes, has met limited measurable success.  41  To this end, it is arguable that SAARC be considered as a forum where regional urban issues can be discussed and policy/program solutions  shared between cities that otherwise lack a critical mass of policy capacity. Only together, arguably, will mega city stakeholders and their  burgeoning 'corridors' be able to move beyond a colonial and postcolonial context.  

59   

Contributions  to  critical  policy  analysis  also  focus  mainly  on  the  upper  tiers  of  the  state;  while  urban  service  delivery  machineries  and  institutions  at  the  lower  tiers  are  neglected  (Leftwich,  2008;  Devas,  2001;  Umeh  &  Andranovich,  2005;  Rakodi,  2004).  As  eluded  to  earlier,  critical  theorists  and  Marxist  analysts  focus  on  the  developing  state  and  attribute  underdevelopment  to  coreperiphery  marginalization, neocolonial effects, and the destruction of the indigenous precolonial mechanisms and  governmental  structures,  vital  to  societal  development  (Amin,  2010).  While  such  analysis  is  certainly  accurate, research agendas dismiss the  ability of governments to  deliver services equitably, arguing that  states  as  a  whole,  lack  the  political  will.  Graft  and  corruption  among  petty  bureaucrats  is  often  blamed  for  the  inability  of  policies  to  translate  into  improved  outcomes.  Generally,  researchers  conclude  that  `good'  policy  ideas  were  subject  to  ineptitude,  underfunded,  and  improperly  implemented.  This  conclusion  rests  on  the  assumptions  that  resources  were  adequate  and  that  intergovernmental  cooperation  was  obtained.  In  other  words,  `policy  failures'  are  blamed  on  state  actors,  institutions,  and  instruments  at  the  policy  implementation  stage.  Similarly,  critical  policy  analysis  tends  to  focus  on  how  the colonial state creates impediments to equitable  service delivery and development, allowing elites to  benefit  from  state  accumulation  of  capital.  Few  studies  have  separated  the  structures  that  support  policy development and formulation from those which implement at the lowest tiers42.   While  policy  activism  led  by  civil  society  has  emerged  from  the  failures  of  state  development,  analyses  have  neglected  service  delivery  reforms.  Research  stops  at  the  failings  of  policy  formulation  and  development at the national/provincial or upper tiers of the state (Banuri et al., 2001). Imported models  are  increasingly  being  viewed  with  suspicion  by  commentators  on  development  policy  as  they  do  not  factor  in  nonstate  engagement  (Satterthwaite,  2006;  Anzorena  et  al,  1998).  Where  civil  society  initiatives have been successful, studies have avoided the policy analysis of precursors to state and non state  engagement.  Civil  society  led  research  under  emphasises  the  value  of  state  and  nonstate  models  for  service  delivery.  Development  research  about  the  global  South  focuses  on  contextspecific  innovative experiences, anecdotal  perspectives, and voices of individuals and communities  (Civis, 2003).                                                                    
42

 For instance, many of the mega cities of South Asia are responsible for jurisdictional problems and challenges that are well beyond 'official  city limits'.  The peri urban fringe is a space where upper and lower tiers of the state jostle for resources and neglect service delivery  responsibility. 

60   

Many  of  these  studies  exclude  the  condition  of  state  institutions  even  if  they  assign  to  them  ultimate  policy  and  program  responsibilities.  Hence,  while  development  research  provides  insight  into  the  realities  of  marginalized  groups  and  challenges  the  assumptions  of  mainstream  studies,  they  avoid  a  rigorous  examination  of  the  state's  role  within  these  societal  contexts.  In  contrast,  research  focused  on  urban service delivery has identified the critical role of the state to sustain efforts beyond the short term  (Siddiqui  et  al.,  2008;  Umeh  &  Andranovich,  2008).  The  outcome  of  a  narrow  research  agenda  is  the  generation of short term solutions, without a sustained long term role for state actors. The result of this  analytical  trend  is  a  lack  of  real  input  for  policy  research  and  reform:  a  sort  of  `policy  black  hole'  (Hay,  2001).  I  will  review  the  literature  more  substantially  in  the  next  chapter,  as  my  purpose  here  is  to  draw  out the composition of the state.   

2.6 The interdisciplinary policy context of service delivery to informal settlements
The  interdisciplinary  literature  reveals  a  range  of  policy  challenges  that  surround  service  delivery  in  mega  cities.  First,  research  from  all  three  bodies  of  literature  has  directly  or  indirectly  pointed  to  the  necessary role of the state in ensuring sustained service delivery to the urban poor (Kundu and Samanta,  2011;  Desai,  1999).  Second,  pressure  on  local  governments  for  services  will  increase  in  the  years  ahead  as  state  resources  and  service  delivery  capacities  experience  scarcity  in  the  face  of  rising  populations  (Sivaramarakrishnan,  1999).  Third,  the  general  consensus  is  that  lower  tiers  of  the  state  have  been  challenged  by  a  history  of  mal  governance:  upper  tier  interests  and  poor  policy  interventions  have  resulted  in  duplicate  departments,  overlapping  mandates,  and  inefficient  and  ineffective  programs  at  the  lower  tiers.  Additionally,  evidence  indicates  that  flawed  upper  tier  policies  and  weak  governance  frameworks  have  resulted  in  the  elite  capturing  public  resources  through  collusion  and  illegal  activities.  Finally, various contextspecific studies have revealed the urgency with which upper and lower tier state  responsibilities  must  be  disentangled  to  ensure  service  to  marginalized  populations  (Mah,  2011;  Bapat  and Agarwal, 2003).   Addressing  the  complexities  of  urban  challenges  is  not  high  on  the  political  (policy)  agenda.  A  lack  of  political will persists at the upper tiers of the state, resulting in limited budget allocations to mega cities.  Disenchanted  informal  sector  stakeholders  have  lost  faith  in  election  promises  and  temporary  interventions to service delivery limitations. Selfhelp civil society actors argue that it is more valuable to  analyze  weaknesses  in  institutional  reforms  rather  than  create  another  set  of  policies  for  lower  tier  61   

actors.  Analyses  of  service  delivery  should  be  based  on  indicators  such  as  levels  of  autonomy,  participation  of  the  informal  sector,  service  delivery  efficiency,  equity,  transparency,  accountability,  and  the  rule  of  law  (Siddiqui  et  al.,  2004;  Zaidi,  2008;  Hasan,  2002;  Chaudhry  and  DevaraJain,  2006).  For  the  state  to  sustainably  reform  administrative  machinery,  it  must  invert  its  policy  approach  and  assess  development from the perspective of the service delivery recipient. As mega cities continue to grow, the  revenues  required  to  sustain  capital  intensive  development,  to  service  a  small  percentage  of  city  dwellers, will fall. There is a need to transform the city into a provider of basic services and participant in  human  development  rather  than  simply  drive  of  physical  development.  State  actors  need  to  join  non state  actors  in  considering  the  voices  of  the  poor,  recipients  of  aid  and  services  (IIED,  2001).  A  `development  from  below'  approach  stresses  the  efforts  of  civil  society  actors  and  lower  tier  state  actors,  who  are  situated  in  marginalized  communities.  If  the  lower  tier  is  valued  and  community  service  delivery  efforts  are  recognized,  replicating  and  facilitating  such  initiatives  through  local  government  departments  will  become  a  policy  priority.  Differentiating  between  upper  and  lower  tier  capacities  and  capabilities  (state  and  nonstate)  is  critical  to  this  process,  as  is  comparison  between  the  functional  role  of state and nonstate service delivery actors to the informal sector. 

2.6.1

Comparisons across South Asia

My survey of the interdisciplinary literature illustrates the vulnerability of South Asia's mega cities to the  adverse  impacts  of  Neoliberalismled  development.  More  comparative  research  about  state  engagement  of  the  informal  sector  across  the  region  will  help  clarify  which  key  variables  that  underpin  megacity  governance  and  urban  management.43  Researchers  have  long  been  aware  of  the  problems  looming  over  large  urban  cities  and  mega  cities  (Fava,  1968),  but  little  comparative  policy  research  has  focused  on  solutions.  The  rate  of  growth  of  the  informal  sector  in  South  Asia  makes  this  kind  of  examination  urgent,  particularly  from  an  integrated  social  and  economic  policy  perspective.  If  the  poor 

                                                                  
43

 Studies across Latin America, Africa and East Asia point to the need for more attention to urban issues and challenges. However, due to the  lack of policy attention and donor interest, these governance concerns are often overlooked and private sector solutions touted in the  literature by upper tier state and nonstate actors. 

62   

continue  to  lack  access  to  basic  services,  mega  cities  will  be  at  increased  risk  in  terms  of  security  and  health.   While  several  state  managed  services  have  been  cited  as  critical  to  human  development,  only  a  few  studies  have  assessed  their  resilience  in  mega  city  settings.  Kamal  Siddiqui's  regional  survey  of  service  delivery  across  South  Asia's  mega  cities  demonstrates  the  critical  linkages  between  housing  and  shelter,  water  and  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  management  (Siddiqui,  2004).  His  thorough  examination  of  service  delivery  informs  the  urban  research  agenda  with  specific  determinants  (variables)  and  constraints  to  service  delivery  outcomes.  The  incorporation  of  his  findings  into  South  Asia's  mega  city  research  agenda  could  in  turn,  inform  the  analysis  of  power  relations  and  optimal  administrative  relations.  Siddiqui's  work  is  relevant  for  my  study  as  he  identifies  specific  variables  for  comparative  analysis as well as focal points for research on the effects of concentrated power relations.   If  service  delivery  extension  to  the  informal  sector  is  neglected,  the  destabilizing  forces  that  undermine  South  Asia's  administrative  development  will  only  threaten  the  already  fragile  levels  of  urban  security.  The  longterm  social  and  economic  benefits  of  inclusive  development  make  it  logical  to  engage  the  informal  sector  and  employ  its  labor  pool.  Given  the  gaps  between  mainstream  and  critical  policy  research  and  the  responses  of  policymakers  to  growing  urban  problems,  it  is  likely  that  the  informal  sector  will  continue  to  struggle  with  limited  recognition  and  support.  Their  deplorable  and  marginalized  conditions will compel them to support and subsidize the economic machinery of urban development at  wage  levels  far  below  human  development  indicators.  Similarly,  if  lower  tiers  of  the  state  and  local  service  delivery  providers  continue  to  experience  marginalization  by  upper  tiers,  they  may  also  be  forced  to  withdraw  from  engaging  the  informal  sector,  overwhelmed  by  neoliberal  policies  (Batley,  2006). The emergence of combined state/nonstate  providers of services may become more common in  extending  basic  services  and  support  to  the  urban  poor.  However,  the  lack  of  coordination  and  accountability  may  result  in  inefficiency  and  lower  returns  on  donor  investment,  so  the  persistence  of  state  neglect  and  the  avoidance  of  critical  reflection  about  policy  and  program  engagement  of  the  informal sector will only polarize mega cities and lead to more insecurity and impoverishment.

2.6.2

A note on the Policy Stages Approach

Upper  and  lower  tier  state  actors  have  complex  effects  on  local  government  service  delivery.  To  organize  these  within  the  context  of  each  country,  a  holistic  yet  policyspecific  heuristic  will  be  beneficial.  Previous  policy  research  designs  have  benefited  from  using  the  `policy  stages'  approach  (Deleon,  1988).  Criticisms  notwithstanding,  one  of  its  weaknesses  is  of  great  benefit  within  the  South  Asian  context:  its  largely  legislative,  topdown  approach  matches  the  centralized  policy  development  behaviour  exhibited  by  state  decisionmakers  in  postcolonial  countries.  By  disaggregating  the  policy  cycle into a series of separate and defined stages, we can focus on key issues of resource allocations and  development,  while  avoiding  the  distractions  of  other  issues.  While  the  policies  themselves  are  not  central  to  the  study,  the  research  will  benefit  from  the  `policy  moment'  from  each  of  the  various  bodies  of literature as follows.  First,  the  field  of  critical  political  economy,  and  the  balance  of  power  relations  across  state  and  market,  will  inform  the  framing  of  the  initial  stages  of  policy  development  and  formulation.  Elitism  often  influences  policy  development  and/or  implementation;  the  content  and  objectives  of  policies  are  influenced  by  class  interests.  At  the  early  stages  of  policy  development,  upper  tier  power  and  policy  development  dynamics  are  often  inconsistent  with  realities  faced  by  the  lower  tiers  of  the  state.  The  lack  of  resources  and  absence  of  authority  and  accountability  outlined  in  these  policies  also  speaks  to  the different contexts of upper and lower tiers of the state.  Second,  research  from  the  field  of  comparative  public  administration  reveals  the  fragmented  context  within  which  implementation  takes  place:  a  number  of  agencies  and  departments  have  overlapping  mandates and legacies from political administrations and ideological periods. As various agencies stake a  claim  in  implementation,  their  organizational  behaviour  and  relationships  with  adjacent  departments  shape  their  role  and  position.  Because  resources  are  scarce,  many  departments  impose  constraints  to  initiatives  to  ensure  their  inclusion.  This  is  particularly  the  case  with  donorfunded  initiatives,  where  resources  are  infused  into  programs  and  subprojects.  Their  positioning  and  relationships  with  one  another  emerges  quite  sharply  during  the  implementation  stage,  and  reflect  the  postcolonial  commonality in South Asian countries.  Finally,  research  from  the  field  of  development  studies  has  revealed  the  lack  of  realworld  impact  by  state  policies.   More  descriptive  contemporary  development  research  has  focused  on  the  realities  faced  64   

by all urban dwellers, particularly the poor. However, when nonstate actors are engaged as proponents  and  supporters  of  the  informal  sector,  they  actually  advocate  for  service  delivery  by  lower  tiers  of  the  state.  In  terms  of  the  policy  stages  approach,  evidence  of  service  delivery  by  nonstate  actors  informs  our  understanding  of  policy  implementation  and  service  delivery  to  recipient  communities.  The  positive  outcomes  of  community  engagement  and  selfhelp  designed  infrastructure  development  can  serve  to  specify  the  required  level  of  state  resources  during  the  implementation  stage  of  service  delivery.  For  example,  resources  are  required  to  mobilize  informal  settlements  and  map  service  delivery  connections  across  these  communities.  Such  resources  are  rarely  even  identified  by  state  actors.  Nonstate  service  delivery models are therefore critical to understanding how service delivery implementation to informal  settlements  is  to  be  designed  as  well  as  resourced.  A  deeper  examination  of  these  arrangements  and  processes will highlight the need to reevaluate topdown policies.  While  each  of  these  bodies  of  literature  is  at  least  somewhat  relevant  to  each  stage  of  policy  making,  their  perspectives  and  results  will  vary  in  relevance  by  the  various  contexts  and  city  settings.  These  differences  will  help  clarify  how  a  range  of  `crosscutting  variables'44  will  affect  policy  settings.  This  research will not apply the usual methodologies employed by the policy stages heuristic, but the findings  will  be  informed  by  policy  commentary  about  South  Asia's  mega  cities.  Given  the  struggles  of  mega  cities,  informal  sector  policies  will  benefit  from  the  examination  of  the  stages.  Finally,  the  results  of  the  stages heuristic s may also encourage  more interdisciplinary approaches to local government machinery  and  assessments.  The  need  for  interdisciplinary  policy  research  on  service  delivery  is  urgent.    The  complex  postcolonial  context  will  benefit  from  a  comparative  approach  across  the  three  mega  cities  of  South  Asia.  A  critical  mass  of  alternative  service  delivery  models  is  in  need  of  assessment  and  attachment  to  policy  capacities  at  the  local  government  level.    A  methodology  that  allows  for  the  gathering of information to address the interdisciplinary research question will  also have to be designed  with  data  types  that  are  familiar  to  all  three  disciplines.    I  now  turn  to  the  explanation  of  the  multi  layered methodology in the next section.   

                                                                  
44 The use and measurement of a series of 'comparator variables' will be discussed more fully in the Methodology section.

3 Methodology and Sources
Conducting  administrative  research  in  a  region  characterized  by  weak  institutional  frameworks  and  volatile political forces presented several methodological hurdles. In order to address challenges such as  data  collection  and  comparative  analysis;  I  employed  qualitative  techniques  common  to  research  in  adverse  environments  (Jervis,  1998).  These  techniques  are  especially  relevant  given  the  effect  that  colonial  and  neocolonial  development  has  had  on  intergovernmental  relations  in  all  three  mega  cities.  Their  shared  experience  with  colonialism  also  makes  their  historical  and  regional  comparison  useful  to  policy  literature  (Pierre,  2005).  The  comparative  policy  approach  is  employed  by  researchers  to  isolate  specific  variables  across  contexts  which  share  a  similar  level  of  complexity.  This  is  especially  applicable  given  the  variance  in  data  sources  across  urban  settings  and  the  challenges  to  comparative  public  management  (Ewene  and  Pawles,  2006).  In  order  to  compare  the  three  mega  city  contexts,  I  combined  the  qualitative  research  approach  with  the  case  study  heuristic.  The  case  study  heuristic  is  employed  to  describe  a  specific  instance  where  observations  result  in  a  particular  outcome.  Once  data  and  information  is  gathered,  evidence  from  specific  measures  can  then  be  triangulated  for  policy  analysis  (Leech  and  Onwuegbuzie,  2007).  Triangulation  is  the  use  of  a  combination  of  research  methods  to  increase  the  confidence  in  an  observed  relation.  For  instance,  my  study  employed  triangulation  by  incorporating  independent  sources  of  evidence  (surveys,  interviews,  secondary  data  sources  and  observations)  to  increase  confidence  in  a  particular  causal  relation.  It  is  used  by  researchers  to  link  observations  from  various  sources  to  a  particular  hypothesis.  There  is  a  growing  trend  towards  triangulation  in  comparative  public  policy.  In  order  to  address  concerns  with  `loose  claims  of  causality',  researchers  emphasize  the  need  for  rigorous  and  specific  approaches  to  linking  relations  between  dependent  and  independent  variables  (Wolf,  2010).  This  chapter  introduces  these  terms  as  elements  of  my  research  design  and  methodology.    I  also  respond  to  the  limitations  of  these  specific  techniques,  later on in the chapter.45

 The methodological limitations and constraints of this kind of research are beyond the scope of this dissertation. Nevertheless, this section  will briefly highlight the complexities as highlighted in the literature. The important point is the need to assess the approaches and

This  chapter  begins  with  a  discussion  of  my  research  design  and  rationale  for  using  the  qualitative  methods and case study approaches. I continue by explaining the service delivery context, and the value  of  exploring  the  regions  municipal  history  and  the  emergence  of  informal  settlements  (Grix,  2002).  In  the  first  subsection  I  outline  the  qualitative  components  of  data  collection  which  consist  of  a  historical  assessment  of  each  megacity  along  with  findings  from  openended,  semistructured,  facetoface  interviews  that  I  conducted  with  state  and  nonstate  actors.  The  qualitative  subsection  concludes  with  the  rationale  for  examining  a  positive  and  negative  case  study  from  the  most  documented  of  service  delivery  contexts:  water  and  sanitation.  In  the  next  subsection,  I  discuss  the  five  comparator  variables,  which  serve  as  determinants  for  service  delivery  outcomes  across  the  three  mega  cities.  The  chapter  concludes  with  an  explanation  of  how  categorizing  findings  through  comparator  variables  and  case  study  `process  tracing'  enables  policy  comparisons  across  service  delivery  contexts  of  mega  cities.  `Process  tracing'  is  an  analytical  tool  used  for  drawing  descriptive  and  causal  inferences  from  diagnostic  pieces  of  evidence.  It  is  often  understood  as  part  of  a  chronological  sequence  of  events  or  phenomena  (Collier,  2011).  The  final  section  specifies  the  data  sources  I  drew  upon  during  primary  and  secondary  research.  Throughout  these  subsections,  I  elaborate  on  the  indicators  that  I  used  to  differentiate  between the roles and responsibilities of lower and upper tier state actors (Howlett and Ramesh, 2006).  

3.1 Research Design
The  interdisciplinary  literature  outlines  the  effect  of  colonial  and  Neoliberal  inspired  development  policies  on  megacity  development.  I  begin  each  mega  city  chapter  with  a  historical  overview  of  the  impact  of  colonialism  on  that  urban  setting.  This  approach  allows  for  the  identification  of  the  dominant  themes  that  emerged  from  the  qualitative  data  (Creswell  et  al.,  2003).  In  each  mega  city  research  context,46  I  drew  on  a  number  of  data  sources  to  measure  state  and  nonstate  efforts  to  facilitate                                                                                                                                                                                                         
methodological considerations of developing city policy research. Ignoring policy analysis and discussions in mega cities will only further erode  the development administration agenda in theoretical and practical terms.  46  Each megacity is surveyed for information on upper and lower tier state and nonstate efforts regarding water and sanitation service  delivery. In each mega city, I also buttress the findings in water and sanitation with observations from the housing and shelter as well as solid  waste management contexts. Although my research examines the water and sanitation service delivery context in each of the three mega cities, the analysis benefits from observations in the other service delivery contexts. In fact, I expect that behaviors between upper and lower  tier actors are similar in different service delivery settings.

service  delivery  to  informal  settlements.  I  bound  these  comparisons  across  mega  cities  using  a  set  of  established  comparator  variables,  which  I  will  discuss  later.  My  analysis  triangulated  evidence  on  the  condition  of  service  delivery  with  differences  between  the  functions  of  upper  and  lower  tier  state  and  nonstate  actors.  This  analytical  approach  allowed  me  to  link  qualitative  sources  and  tests  for  validity  within  and  between  contexts  (Creswell  et  al.,  2003).  In  other  words,  I  compared  evidence  of  upper  and  lower  tier  actors  in  extending  service  to  informal  settlements  across  the  three  mega  cities.  I  concluded  each mega city chapter with case studies that illustrate the influence of comparator variables on service  delivery outcomes. In particular, I contrasted the roles of state and nonstate actors in engaging informal  settlements  and  influencing  successful  service  delivery  outcomes.  I  will  now  explain  each  of  the  approaches in more detail.  The comparative approach explores differences in data types across the regions' mega cities and service  delivery  contexts.  The  common  political,  cultural,  social,  institutional  and  historical  aspects  of  the  three  mega  cities  support  their  comparison  and  the  outcomes  of  `policy  reform'  (Peters,  1996;  Pierre,  2005;  Siddiqui,  K.,  2006;  Gupta,  2012).  The  comparative  approach  is  useful  for  analysis  at  the  subnational  level,  where  small  sample  sizes,  limited  observations,  the  inability  to  code  and  spatial  unevenness  require  mitigation  (Snyder,  2001).  The  approach  is  also  valuable  to  the  South  Asian  urban  contexts  where  qualitative  and  quantitative  data  are  discontinuous  and  fragmented  (Greene  et  al.,  1989).  I  employ  the  qualitative  approach  to  survey  the  service  delivery  landscape  of  the  three  mega  cities  and  group  findings  by  comparator  variable.  Insights  from  the  case  studies  further  demonstrate  the  differences  between  upper  and  lower  tier  state  and  nonstate  actors  in  extending  services.  Contributions  to  the  literature  concur  that  findings  are  enriched  when  gaps  between  contexts  are  bridged  by  insights  from  multiple  sources  (Brennen,  1994;  Greene  et  al.,  1989).  These  insights  are  central to developing an understanding of the complex social and cultural features of comparative policy  analysis  in  developing  countries  (Hay  and  Wincott,  1998).  The  comparative  approach  is  useful  when  service  to  informal  settlements  is  used  as  a  methodological  approach  to  dealing  with  critical  political  economy  issues  (Brenner  et  al,  2011).  The  comparative  approach  assists  in  framing  municipal  policy  issues  in  developing  countries  which  are  influenced  by  multiple  stakeholders  and  interests  (Siddiqui,  2005;  Porter  and  Shortall,  2008).  The  approach  allows  for  the  comparison  of  interviewbased  data  with  other qualitative sources, such as unpublished research reports, papers, and civil society studies.  

68   

Critiques  of  the  comparative  approaches  have  raised  several  concerns,  to  which  researchers  working  in  the  field  of  policy  research  have  responded.  The  main  criticism  is  regarding  the  validity  of  the  `triangulation'  of  data.  Other  concerns  include  the  possibility  of  overstating  claims,  lack  of  rigor  in  design,  sampling  error,  faulty  analysis,  poor  reporting,  financial  commitment,  and  time  requirement.  Proponents  of  comparative  methods  counter  these  arguments  by  stressing  that  the  key  to  conducting  comparative  research  is  developing  a  clear  understanding  about  the  issues  involved,  before  making  claims  about  validity  (Buber  et  al.,  2004).  HesseBiber  (2010a)  responded  to  such  critiques  by  analyzing  the  evolution  and  applications  across  a  range  of  settings.  The  importance  of  communication,  stakeholder inclusion, listening with reflexivity, and challenging assumptions when developing a rigorous  research design are critical components of this approach (HesseBiber, 2010a).  I  have  addressed  these  concerns  through  the  different  sub  components  of  my  research  design.  My  use  of the comparative approach aligned qualitative data between the various mega cities and data sources.  I  triangulated  data  within  and  between  mega  cities  and  `paradigms'  to  ensure  that  comparisons  were  made  between  similar  stakeholders47.  I  also  employed  comparator  variables  to  categorize  a  defined  set  of  determinants  that  shape  the  outcomes  of  service  delivery  extension  to  informal  settlements.  By  carefully  categorizing  observations  of  state  and  nonstate  actors  in  each  of  the  mega  cities,  my  findings  have  assembled  the  characteristics  of  positive  outcomes.  Although  there  are  relationships  between  the  various  comparator  variables,  I  define  them  in  the  broadest  sense  to  analyze  the  roles  of  upper  and  lower tier actors in service delivery. This approach also ensured that my analysis did not overstate claims  (Bazeley,  2004).  The  qualitative  aspects  of  my  research  design  allowed  me  to  crossreference  historical  and comparative data with semistructured interviews. The inclusion of unpublished civil society reports,  government  documents,  donor  reports,  budget  figures,  and  social  and  economic  statistics  is  recommended  as  a  means  of  strengthening  claims  (HesseBiber,  2010b).  Finally,  the  contrasting  of  case

 My research examined the frameworks and arrangements that support service delivery to informal settlements. Because my research is  concerned with the differences between upper and lower tier actors, I have avoided a deep discussion of the comparator variables and the  water and sanitation service delivery context. The international development and multilateral institutional policy literatures have substantial  and lengthy contributions which should be referred to. Because my study seeks to inform the requisite policy frameworks that enable municipal  agencies to extend service to the informal sector, my methodology outlines the rationale for framing the examination in policy terms and  engaging specific state and nonstate actors and data sources.

studies  across  each  of  the  three  mega  cities  illustrated  the  key  features  of  state/nonstate  engagement  that  influence  service  delivery  to  the  informal  sector.  I  will  now  discuss  how  I  have  arrived  at  the  use  of  these `crucial cases' as part of my research design.  The  final  component  of  my  research  design  is  the  case  study  approach,  where  service  delivery  to  two  informal settlements is examined in each mega city. Each case study detailed the specific experiences of  informal  settlements  in  obtaining  service  delivery  in  cooperation  with  nonstate  actors.  Service  delivery  outcomes  are  deemed  as  successful  where  the  informal  settlement  is  able  to  establish  water  and/or  sanitation  services  through  state  and/or  nonstate  actors.  Service  delivery  outcomes  are  deemed  as  unsuccessful  where  the  informal  settlement  is  unable  to  establish  water  and/or  sanitation  services  despite  the  engagement  of  state  and/or  nonstate  actors.  I  used  the  experiences  of  successful  and  unsuccessful outcomes to contrast the roles of different state and nonstate actors in extending services  to  informal  settlements.  Field  case  study  research  expands  on  the  direct  engagement  of  dynamic  actors  in  a  nonpredictable  environment  (Singleton,  R.  and  Straits,  B.,  2005).  I  used  this  approach  to  explain  interactions  between  state  and  nonstate  actors  in  two  informal  settlements  within  each  of  the  three  mega cities (Ragin, C. and Becker, H., 2005; Palys, T. and Atchison, C., 2008). This approach has helped to  establish  a  level  of  conceptual  validity  by  illustrating  the  influence  of  specific  variables  being  analyzed  (Yin,  1981;  George,  A.  and  Bennett,  A.,  2005).  Specifically,  groups  of  `comparator  variables'  described  service  delivery  capacities  between  various  actors  in  each  of  the  case  studies.  These  variables  served  as  building  blocks  for  assessment  in  the  small  number  of  cases  (Ragin,  C.  and  Becker,  H.,  2005;  George,  A.  and Bennett, A., 2005).   The case study approach allows for the examination of `causal mechanisms' across each of the megacity  service  delivery  contexts  (George,  A.  and  Bennett,  A.,  2005).  Causal  mechanisms  can  be  defined  as  the  pathway  that  a  process  follows  by  which  a  particular  effect  is  produced  (Seawright  and  Gerring,  2013).  Employing  causal  mechanisms  is  indispensable  when  explaining  third  world  development  dynamics  (Bradshaw  and  Wallace,  1991).  In  this  study,  each  case  study  demonstrates  how  comparator  variables  influence  nonstate  efforts  at  extending  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements  (Palys,  T.  and  Atchison,  C.,  2008).  This  method  is  referenced  in  the  literature  regarding  qualitative  and  quantitative  options  to  case study selection (Seawright and Gerring, 2013; Bennett and Elmann, 2007; Yin, 1994). The collection  of  data  at  the  local  level  about  varying  levels  of  success  in  service  delivery  and  support  to  informal  settlements,  has  allowed  for  `within  case'  comparisons  of  constraints  and  enablers  in  smalln  analysis  70   

(Mahoney,  2000).  Such  `within  case'  comparisons  have  generated  policy  analysis  with  respect  to  the  ability  of  actors  to  extend  service  delivery  (Ragin,  C.  and  Becker,  H.,  2005).  The  case  study  approach  enables  the  modeling  of  complex  causal  relationships  between  multiple  state  and  nonstate  actors  (Mahoney,  2000).  For  instance,  I  employed  `process  tracing'  to  outline  the  relationships  between  state  and  nonstate  actors  in  arriving  at  a  means  of  extending  service  delivery.  This  approach  has  been  employed  across  the  literature  to  conceptualize  the  relationship  between  various  actors  (Palys,  T.  and  Atchison, C., 2008; Collier, 2011).   The  case  study  approach  is  also  the  subject  of  criticisms  across  the  research  methods  literature.  The  case  study  approach  has  been  criticized  for  its  vulnerability  to  selection  bias  as  well  as  representativeness  (George,  A.  and  Bennett,  A.,  2005;  Flyvbjerg,  2007).  Selection  bias  in  my  study  is  addressed as each pair of mega city case studies were selected based on completely different outcomes.  In  other  words,  nonstate  actors  selected  case  studies  where  service  delivery  experienced  different  outcomes. The influence of each comparator variable on each instance of service delivery outcomes was  then  assessed.  The  representativeness  of  the  case  is  addressed  as  nonstate  actors  directed  the  selection of a `typical case' where service delivery is extended or denied to a community. The bias of the  researcher  is  thus  removed  from  the  selection  process  as  nonstate  actors  are  selecting  the  cases.  The  assumption  is  that  across  contexts  and  mega  cities,  there  will  be  some  similarity  and  parsimony  nested  within  the  explanatory  richness  of  service  delivery  extension.  This  will  provide  insight  into  key  variables  that driven service delivery extension (Yin and Heald, 1975).   The  `dual  approach'  to  case  study  selection  is  logical  for  my  study,  given  that  it  enriches  the  data  that  has  been  categorized  by  comparator  variables  and  compared  across  settings  (Bennett  and  Elmann,  2007).  By  contrasting  service  delivery  experiences  between  informal  settlements,  I  assessed  the  capability  of  state  and  nonstate  actors  within  and  across  cities  for  service  delivery  effectiveness.  This  use  of  `within  case'  analysis  is  commonly  used  within  the  policy  research  literature  (Palys,  T.  and  Atchison,  C.,  2008).  In  each  megacity,  I  defined  the  `class'  of  events  for  case  study  examination  based  on  the  experiences  of  nonstate  actors  who  frequently  facilitate  service  delivery  extension  to  informal  settlements.  This  method  of  selecting  `crucial  cases'  maintains  case  study  objectivity  (George,  A.  and  Bennett,  A.,  2005).  Each  NGO  provided  two  examples  of  service  delivery  extension  to  informal  settlements.  In  one  case,  the  effort  to  extend  service  delivery  was  successful.  In  other  words,  the  informal  settlement  and  its  supporters  in  civil  society  were  able  to  obtain  service  delivery  from  the  71   

state.  In  the  other  case,  the  effort  was  either  unsuccessful  or  has  experienced  delays.  In  this  unsuccessful case, a number of constraining factors has prevented the informal settlements' CBO and its  civil  society  supporters  from  obtaining  recognition  or  service  delivery  from  the  state.  In  our  two  cases,  I  am  engaging  the  facilitating  nonstate  actors  for  their  experiences  in  engaging  informal  settlements  and  obtaining service delivery.  By doing this, I am isolating comparator variable (civil society and donors) for  analysis  in  successful  and  unsuccessful  outcomes.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  in  the  case  of  Mumbai,  I  drew  on  a  larger  set  of  information  (the  broader  experiences  of  toilet  block  implementation  in  Dharavi)  for  the  unsuccessful  case  study  to  make  up  for  my  inability  to  visit  the  mega  city.  Although  the  scale  which  I  apply  to  Mumbai  is  larger  than  the  other  case  studies,  it  allows  me  to  make  claims  on  the  roles  of  specific  comparator  variables.  Before  I  outline  the  nature  of  the  data  and  sources,  I  will  now  explain  the three service delivery contexts of study.  

3.1.1

Service Delivery Contexts and Actors

In  this  subsection  I  outline  the  main  service  delivery  context  and  describe  the  involvement  of  upper  and  lower  tier  state  and  nonstate  actors  in  extending  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements.  Although  an  exhaustive  discussion  of  the  water  and  sanitation  context  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  study,  I  will  mention the key features as they pertain to the current urban policy environment.48 My objective at this  juncture is to emphasize the importance of this service delivery context to informal settlements.  Water  and  sanitation  services  are  central  to  human  development  and  governance  in  mega  cities.  The  interdisciplinary  literature  establishes  this  service  delivery  context  as  key  to  human  development  in  urban  settings  (MUH  HDC,  2009;  UN  Habitat,  2012;  UNEP  2012).  The  ultimate  responsibility  of  ensuring  the  provision  of  water  and  sanitation  services  (and  managing  the  resources  of  land,  water  and  waste)  lies  with  state.  However,  the  state  has  been  found  to  be  unwilling  in  its  engagement  of  informal  settlements  despite  interventions  by  civil  society,  multilateral,  technical  aid,  and  advocacy  based

 The urban poor constitute a growing proportion of megacity populations. However, their contribution is rarely recognized beyond the  inexpensive inputs into sophisticated and organic economic supply chains. This chapter explores some of those benefits and ties policy  interventions at local levels to greater returns on state policy realization at higher levels of government. To put it simply, a healthier, more  empowered urban poor will ensure resilient labor pools in the future.

organizations  (Bartlett,  2003).49  Most  nonstate  led  initiatives  are  based  on  some  level  of  service  delivery extension through municipal capacities.50 Nonstate initiatives are also found in the housing and  shelter  as  well  as  solid  waste  management  sectors,  which  have  also  been  the  focus  of  support  by  both  state  and  nonstate  actors.  I  drew  experiences  from  these  two  sectors,  where  policy  findings  have  generated insights on improving the extension of service delivery. Despite the similarities in models, the  actual  arrangements  between  state  and  nonstate  actors  are  discontinuous.  My  inquiry  into  policy  experiences serves as a form of intervention for policy reform (Koliba and Wathrop, 2007). Hence, these  service  delivery  contexts  are  valuable  in  exploring  the  frameworks  formed  between  specific  state  and  nonstate actors.  I  used  observations  from  the  water  and  sanitation  service  delivery  context  to  anchor  the  findings  from  the  comparative  approaches.  This  approach  enables  a  broad  analysis  of  relevant  data,  in  a  non sequential  manner.   The  use  of  the  qualitative  and  comparative  approach  strengthens  their  power  than  if  each  method  were  to  be  employed  on  its  own  (Creswell,  J.W.  et  al.,  2003,  2009).The  examination  of  state  and  nonstate  based  efforts  to  engage  informal  settlements  is  discussed  in  the  literature  as  beneficial to  organizational development and rights  based frameworks (Sansom, K., 2002; Siddiqui, K. et  al,  2004;  UN  Habitat,  2007).  I  relied  on  a  number  of  academic  and  nonacademic  policy  sources  to  establish  the  historical  and  comparative  state  of  municipal  services  across  the  three  megacity  service  delivery  contexts  and  used  snowball  sampling  to  recruit  key  informants  for  interviews  (See  Appendix).  My  primary  research  questions  mirrored  the  approaches  employed  in  the  field  of  communitystate  engagement  (Greene  et  al.,  1989;  Xerez,  R.  and  Fonseca,  J.,  2011).  This  framework  of  service  delivery  contexts  and  actors  was  the  basis  for  the  comparison  of  capabilities  of  upper  and  lower  tier  state  and  nonstate actors in extending service delivery to the informal sector. The following sections describe the

 Land use planning and zoning is the responsibility of the state. Water supply is part of a public good and is also the responsibility of the state.  Sanitation effects health and the environment, which also involves state responsibility. Finally, even when private actors are contracted out to  collect waste, they obtain and renew that contract with the state.  50  Karachi's selfhelp Community Development Network (CDN) has leveraged housing and water and sanitation efforts to achieve service  delivery to the urban poor. The North Sindh Urban Services Utility is based on the coupling of solid waste management, water, and sanitation  services, with linkages to storm water management. This approach is quietly accepted by the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) in  Karachi, although formal relations with NGOs are not as loudly communicated or broadcast.

various  sources  of  qualitative  data  that  I  drew  upon  during  the  course  of  primary  and  secondary  research.  

3.2 Qualitative Research
Qualitative  data  accounts  for  the  majority  of  information  gathered  in  comparative  approaches  to  the  policy  sciences  (Mahoney,  2007).  I  relied  on  qualitative  data  within  each  of  the  megacity  service  delivery  contexts  for  a  number  of  methodological  reasons.  The  foremost  reason  was  underdeveloped  institutional  frameworks  and  the  absence  of  transparent  reporting  mechanisms.  This  makes  the  collection  and  comparison  of  nonqualitative  data  at  local  levels  of  government  near  impossible.  My  study  relied  on  episodic  as  well  as  running  records  compiled  from  state  and  nonstate  actors  to  assess  service  delivery  outcomes  (Johnson  and  Reynolds,  2012).  I  incorporated  historical  records;  time  bound  studies and inperson interviews into the results of each service delivery context. Although some records  were  available  online,  the  majority  of  episodic  accounts  were  obtained  through  in  person  interviews  I  conducted  with  state  and  nonstate  actors.  I  used  running  records  where  possible,  but  found  the  majority  of  relevant  information  in  isolated,  time  bound  form51.  This  presented  a  few  difficulties  in  measuring  the  influence  of  comparator  variables  on  actors  over  multiple  years.  For  instance,  while  civil  society and donors in the urban water sector have to generate annual reports and progress updates on a  regular  basis,  there  is  discontinuous  information  from  state  actors  such  as  utility  service  providers  for  the same periods.    In  order  to  address  differences  in  episodic  and  data  types  between  sectors,  I  have  drawn  information  from  a  number  of  independent  and  yet  similar  data  sources.52  In  order  to  address  the  variances  in  data  types  found  across  the  three  mega  cities,  I  used  three  types  of  qualitative  research  (historical,  faceto face interviews, and case studies) to categorize the data. This subsection describes the various elements  of  my  qualitative  data  approach.  I  begin  by  outlining  the  historical  and  comparative  research  approach  and  identifying  the  specific  data  sources.  I  continue  with  a  description  of  the  semistructured  interviews

 Much of this is the result of nonstate initiated research (private sector consulting reports, INGO and NGO research).   For example, I have incorporated housing and shelter data from Slum Dwellers International (SDI) who have long been active in slums across  Mumbai and Dhaka. I also engaged WaterAid, an INGO that funds water supply distribution projects by NGOs in Karachi and Dhaka.

with  various  state  and  nonstate  actors  who  I  interviewed.  I  conclude  with  a  description  of  the  case  studies  and  the  various  mega  city  water  and  sanitation  service  delivery  contexts  I  examined.53  I  also  discuss  how  contextual  data  was  grouped  in  comparator  variables  to  form  a  framework  for  comparing  arrangements  across  the  three  mega  cities.  I  now  turn  to  the  first  of  the  three  components,  the  historical and comparative overview. 

3.2.1

Historical and Comparative Overview

Historical data is a key component of South Asian scholarship and provides insight into the development  of  mega  cities  and  the  exclusion  of  informal  settlements.  Historical  data,  personal  accounts,  donor  reports  and  state  documents  from  public  and  private  repositories  serve  as  evidence  of  policy  decisions  that  have  shaped  the  colonial  and  postcolonial  development  of  each  service  delivery  context  (Palys,  T.  and  Atchison,  C.,  2008).  I  situated  my  policy  analysis  by  using  historical  data  and  evidence  from  a  number  of  interdisciplinary  perspectives.  Development  researchers  have  expanded  on  the  shared  colonial  history  by  exploring  the  coalescing  of  interest  groups  and  their  influence  on  local  development  agendas  (Mahoney,  2004).  Similarly  in  South  Asia,  political  economists  have  explored  the  formation  of  mega  cities  in  an  era  of  `globalization'  and  the  dominance  of  neocolonial  forces  on  their  development  (Zaidi,  2001;  Hasan,  2004).  Social  scientists  have  expanded  upon  group  dynamics  and  through  ethnographic  studies,  assessed  constraints  to  their  human  development  (Wasserman  and  Clair,  2011).  Policy  researchers  have  also  argued  that  institutional  reviews  deserve  a  full  examination  of  structure  and  agenda  before  reforms  can  be  truly  implemented  (Hay  and  Wincott,  2008).  Research  across  all  disciplines reveals the role played by elite interests and narrowly defined agendas.54 The result has been  unplanned, sycophantic, externally driven urban development that has spurred city and class formation.

 The utility oriented nature of the water and sanitation sector attracts more policy and program attention, particularly the former from  multilateral institutions and donors interested in optimizing project returns. However, the type of data that is collected is quite different. Water  oriented data will focus on household connections and infrastructure availability. Sanitation based indicators, promoted more by public health  concerns are concerned more with latrine usage and availability of facilities, which may or may not be connected to the utility. Because a result,  the data types between these two sub sectors are different. At the other extreme are sectors which have experienced neglect. Solid waste for  example, despite the efforts of civil society to create recycling and compost oriented markets, is relegated to a few private sector actors and  there is a limited understanding of collection, program measurement and pricing per household for collection. Most of the information is in  time bound studies and real initiatives reside in civil society efforts. The data types are therefore dramatically different.   54  These interest groups, as outlined in the interdisciplinary research, have more impact and influence on policy development than the  institutions responsible for service delivery. Unfortunately, the inability of narrowly defined agendas to be agreed upon and sustained in a  medium to long term plan has stunted administrative machinery and urban development on the whole. 

75   

Over  time,  the  policy  interactions  between  stakeholders  have  excluded  the  informal  sector  from  service  delivery machinery.   In  all  three  megacity  settings  and  service  delivery  contexts,  a  number  of  interests  and  institutions  have  formed  complex  relationships  that  have  affected  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements.  These  competing  interests  have  disabled  the  extension  of  service  delivery  to  different  degrees.  My  research  engaged  both  state  and  nonstate  actors  and  the  range  of  perspectives  and  approaches  to  extending  service  delivery  to  the  informal  sector.  I  responded  to  the  concerns  of  bias  and  perspectives  where  only  `one side of the story' is researched and analyzed, by engaging both state and nonstate actors (Palys, T.  and  Atchison,  C.,  2008).  Because  narrowly  defined  agendas  shape  service  delivery  data  in  unpredictable  ways,  service  delivery  data  is  often  discontinuous,  hidden,  and  time  bound.  I  conducted  a  historical  review of policies and programs, institutions and critical incidents to synthesize available data and direct  my  secondary  data  collection  exercise.  Similar  to  the  literature  review,  this  approach  allowed  me  to  analyze  the  processes  of  social  change,  and  provide  depth  through  replication  and  increased  sample  sizes (Singleton, R. and Straits, B., 2005). It has also allowed me to  reduce bias, which is characteristic of  historical  studies  reliant  on  primary  and  secondary  research  (Thies,  2002).  This  is  particularly  important  given  the  complexity  of  the  South  Asian  urban  administrative  context.  I  will  now  outline  each  of  the  three streams of data that informed the historical overview. 

3.2.1.1 PoliciesandProgramreview
Broad and overarching national and subnational policies have been developed for most mega cities and  sectors  of  service  delivery  responsibility.  The  outcomes  of  these  policies,  as  a  function  of  adequate  resources  and  appropriate  program  design,  have  been  mixed  at  best.  This  is  not  surprising,  given  that  the  legislative  agendas  of  the  regions  ruling  class  as  well  as  the  condition  of  the  region's  lower  tier  municipal administrations are similar. I researched and drew evidence on the outcomes of these policies  for  each  megacity.  Not  surprisingly,  I  found  a  number  of  critiques  regarding  legislation,  state  policies,  and  program  implementation  from  nonstate  actors  across  each  of  the  service  delivery  contexts.  The  prevalence  of  nonstate  efforts  to  address  the  shortcomings  of  state  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements  validates  the  deplorable  condition  of  state  programs.  Finally,  I  assessed  policy  reforms  designed  to  engage  informal  settlements  as  a  measure  of  the  state's  will  and/or  capability  to  develop  relevant  policies  and  programs.  The  overview  of  policies  and  programs  for  each  service  delivery  context 

76   

provided  a  basis  for  comparison  between  mega  cities.  Despite  the  role  played  by  civil  society  actors,  a  deeper insight emerged from an examination of the institutional framework.  

3.2.1.2 InstitutionalFramework
The  gaps  between  policy  formulation  and  implementation  emerge  from  the  condition  of  programs  and  institutions at the lower tiers of the state. Policy research shows that the arrangements of departmental  portfolios,  program  areas  and  funded  agencies  reflect  the  condition  of  intergovernmental  relations,  policy  priorities  and  implementation  (Pierre,  1999).  My  assessment  of  resource  allocations  across  each  mega  city  and  its  range  of  institutions  revealed  the  political  economy  of  state  dynamics  between  the  upper  and  lower  tiers.  My  examination  of  the  history  and  evolution  of  interest  based  activity  revealed  the  persistence  of  postcolonial  and  neo  colonial  after  effects.  More  specifically,  the  poor  condition  of  administrative  machinery,  reflective  of  sub  optimal  resource  levels,  organizational  dependency  and  subsidization  from  nonstate  actors;  provided  an  understanding  into  institutional  mismanagement.  By  looking  at  the  institutional  frameworks,  I  generated  insights  on  the  state  of  lower  tier  actors  charged  with  service  delivery.  Unfortunately  institutional  transparency  has  been  lacklustre  in  many  of  these  municipal  administrative  contexts  as  data  has  been  unavailable.  Furthermore,  most  of  these  megacity  administrations  have  experienced  bouts  of  social,  political  and  environmental  instability.  Conversely,  all  mega  cities  have  experienced  periods  where  donor  and  civil  society  interests  have  aligned,  resulting  in  large  project  injections  and  resource  flows.  As  a  result,  my  research  has  relied  on  periodic  time  bound  reviews.    In  order  to  incorporate  these  policy  `moments'  and  events  that  have  influenced  urban  development,  I  concluded  the  historical  comparative  approach  for  each  megacity  with  a  review  of  critical incidences that have impacted the condition of state service delivery to the informal sector. 

3.2.1.3 Criticalincidents
State  institutions  are  tested  during  periods  of  upheaval  and  crisis.  The  origins  of  such  periods  of  disruption  range  from  political  regime  change  to  environmental  disasters.  All  three  mega  cities  have  experienced  periods  of  pronounced  insecurity  over  the  last  two  decades.  Flooding  resulted  from  the  seasonal  monsoons  across  each  city  with  effects  on  service  delivery.  Physical  insecurity,  social  unrest  and  political  regime  change  are  among  the  most  obvious  examples  of  critical  incidents  which  mark  the  histories  of  these  cities.  In  most  cases,  there  has  been  an  increasingly  harsh  and  critical  response  about  the  inability  of  institutions  to  respond to  the  needs  of  citizens.  I  included  the  effect  of  critical  incidences  on  informal  settlements,  along  with  the  state  response  in  the  historical  overview.  I  categorized  critical  77   

incidences  as  political,  social,  economic  and  environmental  events.  My  review  of  these  incidents  has  helped  to  establish  a  map  through  which  `process  tracing,'  cross  referencing,  and  triangulation  of  data  with  semistructured  interviews  can  occur  (Singleton,  R.  and  Straits,  B.,  2005).  As  these  events  reside  within the historical memory of the mega city, I had to resort to a commonly used method for gathering  recent information, the semistructured interview.  

3.2.2

Semi-Structured Interviews

In  order  to  bring  the  analysis  of  municipal  service  delivery  machinery  into  the  present  frame  of  reference,  I  conducted  semistructured  interviews  with  key  state  and  nonstate  actors  (See  Appendix).  The semistructured interview builds on the historical analysis of service delivery with insights from state  and  nonstate  actors  (Sturges  and  Hanrahan,  2004).  Structured  and  open  ended  questions  allow  respondents  to  provide  their  insights  above  and  beyond  key  questions  (Johnson  and  Reynolds,  2012).  In  a  process  known  as  `funnelling,'  questions  begin  with  participant  experiences  on  policy  effectiveness  and  ended  with  recommendations  on  context  specific  policy  solutions  to  improving  service  delivery  (Palys,  T.  and  Atchison,  C.,  2008).  I  used  open  ended  questions  to  probe  respondent  experiences  with  intergovernmental  relations,  informal  sector  engagement,  and  the  roles  of  state/nonstate  service  providers  in  extending  service  delivery  (Siddiqui  et  al,  2004).  I  assembled  insights  from  key  informants,  technical  experts,  sector  stakeholders,  and  CBO  actors  from  informal  settlements  to  assess  service  delivery  experiences  and  arrangements  that  optimize  outcomes  (McCormack,  2000).  There  are  a  number  of  benefits  and  drawbacks  to  the  use  of  semistructured  interviews,  which  I  briefly  discuss  in  light  of  the  challenges  and  limitations  of  data  availability  in  the  South  Asian  megacity  service  delivery  context.   As  the  study  area  is  characterized  by  diverse  and  discontinuous  data  sources,  establishing  a  robust  framework  for  interviews  was  challenging.  Interview  participants  in  developing  countries  are  a  rich  source  of  institutional  and  policy  history,  given  their  social  interaction  and  mobility  across  sectors55

 State and nonstate actors are interested in elevating the profile of their efforts and engaging with a researcher who is also member of the  not for profit community. Similarly, state actors respect the civic service experience of the researcher and have also been forthcoming with  information about their challenges and issues 

78   

(Palys,  T.  and  Atchison,  C.,  2008;  Lilleker,  2003).  Furthermore,  in  polarized  administrative  research  contexts  where  the  voice  of  lower  tier  state  and  nonstate  actors  is  rarely  represented,  face  to  face  interviews  ensure  their  inclusion.  Similarly,  state  and  nonstate  actors  are  ready  to  identify  key  informants  and  interview  candidates  (Palys,  T.  and  Atchison,  C.,  2008).  This  is  especially  the  case  with  donors  and  civil  society  actors  whose  experts  are  mobile  and  dispersed  among  different  communities  (Johnson and Reynold, 2012). Finally, the policy research setting requires the expertise of the researcher  as  well  as  the  respondent,  in  order  to  fully  address  the  research  problem  and  question  (Rapley,  2001;  Palys,  T.  and  Atchison,  C.,  2008).  Both  `key  informants'  and  `elite  insiders'  possess  information  and  insights  that  are  valuable  to  the  analysis  of  the  research  question  (Johnson  and  Reynold,  2012).  I  used  the  interviews  to  document  interactions  between  upper  and  lower  tier  actors,  which  have  been  triangulated in the analysis section, the result of the open ended approach (Rapley, 2001).   A  number  of  drawbacks  exist  to  this  approach,  primarily  related  to  the  costs  associated  with  conducting  research  in  developing  countries.  The  cost  of  conducting  in  country  interviews  is  high  and  assumes  a  longer  study  horizon  of  the  research  regarding  the  megacity  service  delivery  context56  (Palys,  T.  and  Atchison,  C.,  2008).  Nevertheless,  as  the  analysis  is  nuanced  and  similarities  to  responses  are  subtle,  having  one  interviewer  for  all  of  the  research  justifies  the  expense.  I  was  able  to  engage  policy  advisors  and  front  line  bureaucrats  along  with  sector  focused  donors,  nongovernment  trainers,  and  community  based  practitioners  for  insights  about  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements  (Johnson  and  Reynold,  2012). Due to travel restrictions, I was unable to obtain a VISA to visit Mumbai. However, thanks to long  standing  regional  partnerships  developed  through  my  work  with  SDPI  in  Islamabad,  I  was  able  to  interview  India  based  state  and  nonstate  actors  in  Dhaka  and  Karachi.  I  also  corresponded  with  several  nonstate  actors  in  Mumbai  (Sulabh  International  and  SPARC)  and  was  able  to  interview  them  over  the  phone  and  incorporate  representative  case  studies  into  my  research.  The  combination  of  primary  and  secondary  evidence  from  state  and  nonstate  actors  (CBOs  and  NGOs)  allowed  me  to  triangulate  evidence on informal settlements in Mumbai.

 In response, this study is an investment in a longer term research project of relationship and policy research capacity building 

79   

By  assembling  reflections  from  actors  at  the  `bottom  of  the  pyramid,'  I  developed  an  understanding  of  how  state  and  nonstate  actors  engaged  to  extend  service  delivery  to  the  urban  poor.57  In  the  next  section,  I  describe  in  greater  detail  my  research  participants  who  I  engaged  across  each  of  the  mega  cities  and  service  delivery  contexts.  The  following  table  outlines  the  categories  and  numbers  of  various  interviewees  and  their  positions  within  the  organizations  that  are  included  in  my  study  analysis.  I  was  able  to  interview  several  state  and  nonstate  representatives  in  each  mega  city.  Unfortunately,  due  to  travel  restrictions,  I  was  unable  to  travel  to  Mumbai.  However,  I  was  able  to  meet  many  state  and  non state  actors  from  Mumbai  at  conferences,  workshops  and  field  offices  in  Dhaka  and  Karachi.  In  other  instances,  I  conducted  interviews  with  key  informants  over  the  phone  from  Islamabad.  By  triangulating  primary  and  secondary  evidence,  I  was  then  able  to  analyze  comparator  variables  across  all  three  mega  cities.

57 The work of CK Prahalad has been instrumental in bringing to light the potential and impact of stakeholders in development contexts to 

contribute to societal wellbeing. An unfortunate by product of this discussion has been that the majority of the ensuing discussion has been  dominated by the relationship between private actors. State and nonstate engagement and the creativity that can result from solution  development have been neglected. This study seeks to re appropriate the discussion within the publiccommunity framework.

3.2.2.1 State
State  actors  can  provide  an  inside  perspective  regarding  the  forces  that  influence  policies  and  programs  that  support  service  delivery.  I  was  able  to  interview  a  few  informed  upper  tier  state  actors  (provincial  ministers  and  senior  bureaucrats)  who  have  a  broader  view  of  the  policy  landscape.  While  these  upper  tier  state  actors  have  a  proven  capacity  in  policy  formulation,  their  knowledge  of  ground  realities  and  policy  effects  on  informal  settlements  are  limited.  Lower  tier  state  actors  on  the  other  hand  (departmental  directors,  managers,  engineers  and  municipal  officials),  are  more  exposed  to  day  to  day  operational  realities.  Some  of  the  'street  level  bureaucrats'  are  in  tune  with  the  condition  of  informal  settlements.  I  was  able  to  interview  several  water  and  sanitation  directors  and  managers  who  have  a  clearer  'view  of  the  street'  as  compared  to  their  upper  tier  state  counterparts.  Unfortunately,  the  lower  tier  state  actors  lack  the  institutional  frameworks  or  engagement  to  inform  higher  tier  policy  makers  as  to  the  limitations  and  condition  of  service  delivery.  They  are  mired  in  an  environment  of  constraints  despite  having  an  informed  perspective  on  policy  effectiveness  at  the  program  level.  The  constraints  to  lower  tier  engagement  of  the  policy  process  are  attributed  to  the  myriad  of  elitist  agendas  and  inter departmental power structures. In reality, upper and lower tier actors probably engage nonstate actors  more  than  they  do  each  other,  which  make  the  inclusion  of  nonstate  actors  even  more  important  (Peters, 2004). I have been able to include representative voices from upper and lower tiers of the state  in my research. As discussed earlier, I have also triangulated interview data with secondary research and  nonstate actors to increase confidence in causal relations. 

3.2.2.2 Donors
The most  dominant `nonstate' actors to South Asia's megacity  policy and  program delivery context are  the  financial  donors.  The  larger,  multilateral  institutions  (MLI)  are  focused  on  larger  capital  intensive  projects  which  are  part  of  broad  economic  and  infrastructure  development  agendas.  MLIs  will  engage  upper  tier  state  actors  on  an  ongoing  basis  and  wield  as  much  (if  not  more)  power  as  state  policy  functionaries (Bello, W., 2012; Khor, M., 2011). Their activities have various effects on service delivery to 

81   

informal  settlements,  more  so  than  the  service  delivery  machinery  itself58.  The  smaller,  technically  oriented  aid  agency  is  either  country  program  driven  or  sector  specific.  I  was  able  to  interview  many  program officers and project managers from each mega city on their activities. These donors are focused  on  key  sectors  of  service  delivery  improvement  and  recognize  in  part,  the  shared  role  of  state  and  non state  actors.  An  excellent  example  is  Wateraid  who  document  field  experiences  and  narratives  from  social workers mobilizing communities in the field (Wateraid, 2012). Where possible, they act as political  stakeholders  for  specific  issues  and  engage  in  cross  country  advocacy  and  policy  research.  Taken  together,  their  project  portfolios  form  one  half  of  development  objectives  and  initiatives.  Their  funding  models  are  smaller  than  their  MLI  counterparts  and  they  wield  less  political  power  on  the  international  stage. Participants from both groups of donors have been engaged for interviews. Although I was unable  to travel to Mumbai, I had the opportunity to interview India based donors in both Dhaka and Karachi. It  should  also  be  noted  that  I  engaged  those  donors  who  are  actively  involved  in  facilitating  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements.  As  such,  all  nine  donors  are  active  to  some  degree  in  the  other  mega  cities. Donors as a whole have been both challenged and engaged in recent years by civil society actors. I  now turn to outlining and describing the relevance of this group of nonstate actors. 

3.2.2.3 CivilSocietyOrganizations(Nonstateactors)
South  Asia's  civil  society  organizations  have  grown  to  encompass  a  wide  range  of  development  related  activities.  They  include,  in  the  broadest  sense,  International  NonGovernment  Organizations  (INGOs),  domestic  NonGovernment  Organizations  (NGOs)  and  the  more  local  Community  Based  Organizations  (CBOs). I focused on engaging those civil society actors involved in the service delivery sectors and mega  cities of interest. I was able to interview several NGO actors as well as CBO actors from each of the three  mega  cities.  The  larger  INGOs  behave  as  donors  and  fund  specific  NGO  projects  by  lending  knowledge  and  technical  expertise  to  service  delivery  extension  to  the  informal  sector.  The  more  domestic  NGO  which  operate  nationally  with  offices  and  networks  in  one  specific  region  or  country.  Finally,  there  are  the  representative  CBOs  which  are  embedded  within  the  informal  settlements  themselves.  I  engaged

 Large MLI funded transportation and land development projects will contribute to evictions and precarious habitations among the informal  sector, rather than rooting and establishing their human development. 

82   

the  more  technically  and  socially  aware  NGOs  that  facilitated  engagement  between  state  and  CBO  actors to the informal sector. I corresponded with NGOs and CBOs from Mumbai and was provided with  documentation  on  case  studies  and  report  documentation.  Similarly  I  interviewed  those  CBOs  who  are  engaging  NGOs  for  service  delivery  assistance  across  each  of  the  three  mega  cities.  Their  cooperative  and  often  collaborative  efforts  provided  a  front  line  perspective  about  the  realities  of  service  delivery59.  Their  insights  support  the  qualitative  analysis  and  interdisciplinary  policy  literature,  which  provides  a  range  of  insights  about  factors  that  affect  service  delivery  (Siddiqui  et  al,  2004,  Umeh  and  Andranovich,  2008).  I  have  crossreferenced  responses  from  state  and  nonstate  participants  with  historical  data  to  assess  policies  and  service  delivery  program  machinery  to  informal  settlements.  For  example,  I  asked  civil  society  actors  about  the  accountability  and  transparency  elements  of  service  delivery  programs  that  have  been  initiated  in  the  past.  Similarly,  I  asked  informal  settlement  dwellers  about  the  role  of  upper  and  lower  tiers  of  the  state  in  responding  to  their  requests  for  state  services.  I  noticed  that  the  responses  from  upper  and  lower  tier  state  actors  generated  insights  into  issues  of  power,  control,  indifference  and  neglect  across  the  various  service  delivery  contexts  and  programs.  Civil  society  actors  and CBOs accounted for the majority of  the interviewees as they have been more actively engaged with  informal  settlements  and  their  constituents.  Most  of  the  informal  settlement  dwellers  interviewed  are  members  of  their  local  CBOs.  Evidence  from  different  service  delivery  contexts  (between  historical  overviews  and  semistructured  interviews)  addressed  the  dynamics  between  upper  and  lower  tiers  of  the  state  and  the  means  by  which  service  delivery  programs  can  be  improved  to  informal  settlements.  However,  both  historical  overviews  and  semistructured  interviews  are  detailed,  time  bound  and  context specific. The case study method provided me with a detailed and descriptive narrative of service  delivery experiences. In order to access this detailed narrative, I engaged a group of technically oriented

 South Asia's state and nonstate actors are increasingly familiar with the range of research efforts (academic and nonacademic) and inquiries  that incorporate them as subject matter. My state and nonstate background will enable me to engage interview participants in policy  discussions from both a practitioner and academic perspective allows for trust building and relationship development with stakeholders. In an  environment built on social engagement and trust, this is invaluable in obtaining deeper and more honest responses to questions.

3.2.3

Case studies

In collaboration with civil society actors, I identified six specific case studies as `crucial cases' for analysis  (Gerring,  2007).  I  define  successful  cases  as  those  where  water  and  sanitation  service  delivery  is  extended  from  the  state  to  the  informal  settlement.  I  define  unsuccessful  cases  as  those  where  the  extension  of  water  and  sanitation  services  was  constrained  and  the  informal  settlement  was  or  continues to be unable to engage the state and obtain services60.

In  contrast,  Kalyanpur  Pura  Basti  (or  Kalyanpur  Pura  slum)  was  been  engaged  by  DSK  for  several  years.  Despite  multiple  evictions  and  infrastructure destruction, inhabitants managed to obtain service delivery.

 As a practitioner within the water and sanitation industry, I will not pretend to simply state the meaning of service delivery. The quality,  availability, reliability, supply, collection and fair billing of services must be accounted for. However, a water connection to a household pipe or  community water point is universal and an essential component of service delivery. It is establishment of the connection (to a household or  community) which I define as the provision of service. Given my focus on the 'arrangements between state and nonstate actors to extend  services, I am not concerned with the technical or financial models which would emerge from the requisite cooperation. In contrast to more  technical approaches to the study of water and sanitation, the supply and pressure (determined by source water availability among other  factors) and the efficiency of collection (determined by operations and maintenance resources) are excluded from my definition of what  determined 'successful service delivery outcomes'.

In  Karachi,  Ghazi  Goth  was  engaged  by  the  Orangi  Pilot  Project  (OPP)  and  developed  a  strong  and  vibrant CBO. Nevertheless, the Goth has witnessed a start and stop process of service delivery extension  as  political  interference  has  constrained  service  delivery  from  the  Karachi  Water  and  Sewage  Board  (KWSB).  In  contrast,  Dost  Mohammad  Junjar  Goth  (situated  next  to  the  city's  thriving  produce  market)  managed to obtain service delivery from KWSB with minimal facilitation from the OPP RTI.  In  Mumbai,  I  obtained  documentation  from  SI  as  well  as  SPARC  on  case  studies  which  experienced  different  variables  of  success.  Dadar  TT  was  engaged  by  Sulabh  International  (SI)  as  one  of  the  city's  pilot  community  led  toilet  blocks.  Thanks  for  the  planning  and  management  of  SI,  the  toilet  block  has  been  able  to  sustain  operating  and  maintenance  costs.  In  contrast,  a  large  number  of  Dharavi's  toilet  blocks have experienced repeated failure despite  management by the Society  for the Protection of Area  Resources  Centre  (SPARC).  While  the  Dharavi  case  study  is  at  a  larger  scale,  the  examples  illustrate  the  failure  of  top  down  projects  which  seek  to  promote  one  size  fits  all  solutions  to  local  design  constraints.  This  has  been  attributed  to  interference  by  multiple  stakeholders  including  both  state  and  nonstate  actors.  The  various  case  studies  are  situated  across  different  socio  economic  and  cultural  contexts.  However,  the  fact  remains,  infrastructure  remains  infrastructure,  no  matter  the  location  (expand  how  this  is  validated in various case studies).   In  order  for  the  case  studies  to  be  of  use  to  policy  makers,  I  summarized  each  case  study  through  `process  tracing'  where  the  responses  to  `events'  by  state  and  nonstate  actors  that  affect  service  delivery  outcomes  were  documented  (George,  A.  and  Bennett,  A.,  2005).  I  have  structured  each  case  starting  with  a  background  of  the  settlement,  followed  by  the  nature  of  intervention  (by  the  NGO)  and  concluded  with  the  current  state  and  next  steps.  The  layering  of  each  case  study  with  primary  and  secondary  research  addressed  challenges  related  to  lack  of  context  (Becker,  1979;  Palys,  T.  and  Atchison,  C.,  2008).  Methodological  concerns  with  multiple  levels  of  analysis  were  addressed  through  the  focused  comparison  of  the  water  and  sanitation  service  delivery  context  across  a  small  number  of  cities, buttressed by a large number of  observations by different actors (Denters, B. and  Mossberger, K.,  2006; Flyvbjerg, 2006; Yin and Kaftarian, 1997). The following types of primary and secondary data were  compiled. 

85   

3.2.3.1 PrimaryResearch
Each case study data set was framed through semistructured interviews with key informants and onsite  visits  (Ragin,  C.  and  Becker,  H.,  2005).  These  interviews  outlined  the  current  state  of  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements.  Firsthand  observations  and  interviews  with  civil  society  representatives  and  practitioners  provided  insight  into  the  current  condition  of  service  delivery.  Similarly,  semistructured  interviews  with  state  actors  and  donors  provided  data  about  the  priority  of  engaging  informal  settlements  and  `confidence'  in  terms  of  their  financing.  Because  the  entirety  of  data  and  information  about  each  informal  settlement  did  not  reside  with  active  state  and  nonstate  interview  participants,  additional research was drawn from secondary resources.  Although  my  research  design  included  plans  to  engage  local  state  and  nonstate  actors  across  all  three  mega  cities,  I  was  unable  to  arrange  for  a  visit  to  Mumbai.  The  presence  of  entry  VISAs  and  stamps  to  my  native  Pakistan  prevented  the  Indian  high  commission  from  issuing  me  a  VISA  to  enter  India.    In  order  to  maintain  a  sufficient  level  of  rigour  in  my  research,  I  engaged  a  number  of  key  informants  who  have  worked  specifically  on  water  and  sanitation  issues  in  Mumbai  and  are  familiar  with  upper  and  lower  tier  challenges  and  dynamics.  The  combination  of  secondary  research  and  correspondence  from  nonstate  actors  in  Mumbai  (SI  and  SPARC)  enabled  me  to  triangulate  evidence  on  service  delivery  to  informal settlements. I also engaged several donors and academics in Toronto and Montreal with critical  research and perspectives on Mumbai's development. 

3.2.3.2 SecondaryResearch
The  second  component  of  case  study  data  was  assembled  through  the  compilation  of  documents  and  unpublished  reports  from  state,  donor,  civil  society  and  community  based  sources.  This  component  of  case  study  research  established  the  history  of  service  delivery  to  the  informal  sector  and  the  policy  context  from  which  those  efforts  emerged  (Ragin,  C.  and  Becker,  H.,  2005).  Similarly,  state  actors  and  donors  were  engaged  for  policy  reports,  consultant  documents  and  evaluations  of  service  delivery  to  those  specific  communities.  Civil  society  actors  were  also  engaged  for  published  and  unpublished  works  about  service  delivery  experiences  within  the  specific  communities.  Information  from  progress  reports 

86   

was  incorporated  into  the  secondary  research  and  analysis.  Each  case  study  compared  experiences  and  common  features  of  service  delivery  extension  across  the  various  contexts  and  mega  cities  (George,  A.  and  Bennett,  A.,  2005).  The  triangulation  of  case  study  data  with  other  sources  within  that  service  delivery context verifies the factual nature of the data and addresses the bias of state policies61 (George,  A.  and  Bennett,  A.,  2005).  In  light  of  the  historical  overview  and  insights  from  the  semistructured  interviews, the case studies highlight informal sector growth and service delivery demands.  Taken  together,  the  historical  overview,  semistructured  interviews  and  case  studies  provided  information  about  the  dynamics  of  service  delivery  to  the  three  mega  cities.  While  data  that  I  collected  varied  among  the  three  mega  cities,  patterns  between  the  municipalities  emerge  from  the  cross  referenced  and  triangulated  data.  This  was  invaluable  in  analyzing  the  service  delivery  context  in  Mumbai.  Process  tracing  across  these  megacity  contexts  allowed  me  to  inform  valid  comparisons  for  policy  actors62  (Gerring,  J.,  2007).  Similarly,  it  has  enabled  the  comparison  of  the  roles  of  upper  and  lower tiers of the state on service delivery to informal settlements.   It  must  be  noted  that  a  substantial  amount  of  secondary  research  exists  on  Mumbai's  water  and  sanitation context. This is due to the well documented work of nonstate actors (SI and SPARC) and their  efforts  with  slums  across  the  mega  city.    A  history  of  civil  society  interventions  has  also  drawn  a  substantial amount of commentary from supporters and detractors of alternative service delivery efforts  towards slum dwellers and informal settlements. Now that I have outlined the research methods, let me  discuss the five comparator variables that I used to categorize primary and secondary research.

 For example, government policies and programs from water and sanitation authorities will be compared with reports from media and civil  society communications regarding water education and the success of service delivery. Documents from all sources will be analyzed in parallel  to assess program success and the condition of service delivery support over time.  62  Programs that encourage the development of low cost sanitation solutions or potable water provision at the household/community level may  experience common drivers and constraints from certain stakeholders.  

87   

3.3 Comparator Variables
The  organization  of  my  primary  and  secondary  research  was  facilitated  by  five  determinants  of  service  delivery  to  water  and  sanitation  service  delivery.  The  review  of  regional  policy  research  methodologies  supports the use of these variables as determinants of positive outcomes in development administration  and  service  delivery  (Siddiqui  et  al,  2004;  Umeh  and  Andranovich,  2012;  OECD  Tax  Collection).  By  cross  referencing  qualitative  and  quantitative  data  from  various  state  and  nonstate  actors,  I  was  able  to  bind  evidence  from  the  various  mega  cities  to  a  comparative  framework63.  The  crosscutting  or  `comparator  variables' that were selected are:   1. Political representation  2. Administrative accountability and transparency  3. Intergovernmental support   4. Citizen engagement  5. Donor and Civil Society activity   As  these  variables  have  been  developed  and  employed  across  the  interdisciplinary  literature,  I  have  addressed  their  application  to  the  research  contexts  of  interest.  Moreover,  these  variables  explore  engagement  between  upper  and  lower  tier  actors  and  their  influence  on  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements.  My  objective  in  employing  each  of  these  comparator  variables  was  to  account  for  as  many  of  the  factors  that  influence  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements.  Although  there  are  relationships  and  linkages  between  comparator  variables,  my  goal  has  been  to  categorize  the  determinants  that  influence positive and negative service delivery outcomes. They are summarized in the following table.

 Approaches across the 'Municipal North' outline the importance of tax collection and to a lesser extent, revenue collection (in light of the  ideological bias regarding the role of the state) to sustaining urban services. Across the 'Municipal South', relying merely on such an approach is  naÃ¯ve given the lack of program leave alone policy capacity that exists at the lower tiers of the state. Nevertheless, the employment of the  comparator variables categorizes common characteristics of state and nonstate stakeholder in contributing to the extension of service  delivery, to the benefit of the informal sector. Taken together, these actions need to be factored into policy frameworks in developing countries  to ensure the appropriate balance of interventions and activities by all actors.

  A  lengthy  discussion  of  where  different  determinants  should  be  categorized  is  beyond  the  scope  of  my  dissertation  research.  I  begin  each  of  the  following  sub  sections  by  conceptualizing  the  comparator  variable.  I  then  proceed  by  discussing  how  different  categories  of  the  comparator  variable  are  drawn  from various data sources. Let us now turn to the first variable, political representation. 

3.3.1

Political Representation

Political  representation  is  defined  in  my  research  study  as  the  position  taken  by  elected  officials  in  extending  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements.  Despite  the  representation  of  elected  officials  in  urban  poverty  alleviation  schemes,  `pro  poor'  initiatives  have  experienced  limited  success  in  urban  settings  (Siddiqui  et  al.  2004;  Laquian,  A.,  2006).  Where  political  leaders  are  elected  by  inhabitants  of  informal  settlements,  one  would  expect  increased  policy  attention  to  service  delivery  concerns  (Houtzager,  P.  et  al,  2002).  This  has  certainly  been  found  in  cities  such  as  Kolkata,  where  a  strong  political  movement  applies  a  relentless  level  of  pressure  on  the  leadership  class,  on  behalf  of  the  urban  poor,  many  of  them  within  the  informal  sector.  Political  theory  would  assume  that  sufficient  mobilization  of  informal  settlements  would  draw  support  from  elected  officials.  Secondly  the  ability  of  informal  settlements  to  engage  political  leaders  regarding  policy  priorities  reflects  the  profile  of  pro 89   

poor programs and their actual functioning (Blair, H., 2000). In mega cities where polarized communities  exists side by side, one would expect some level of support and even subsidization in obtaining access to  water and sanitation related services64.   I  gathered  qualitative  data  from  state  and  nonstate  sources  and  grouped  them  within  this  comparator  variable.  Data  from  key  informants  and  informal  settlement  respondents  was  used  to  measure  the  tendency  of  officials  to  formulate  policies  to  facilitate  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements.  Of  course,  debureaucratization  and  delegation  of  responsibility  requires  political  will  and  activism.  Hence,  other  requisite  policies  are  required  prior  to  policy  implementation  (Umeh  and  Andranovich,  2004).  In  the  absence  of  representation  by  elected  officials,  I  also  account  for  representation  by  other  advocates  for  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements.  These  actors  might  include  donors,  CBOs  and  NGOs  active  within  informal  settlements.  Although  civil  society  activism  cannot  substitute  for  the  political  will  of  elected  officials,  their  ability  to  protest  and  disrupt  community  stability  is  a  measure  of  political  engagement.  My  research  counters  criticisms  of  decentralization  by  pointing  that  that  the  requisite  levels  of  empowerment  of  lower  tier  actors  had  not  taken  place.  This  has  resulted  in  the  failure  of  `devolution'  which  is  highlighted  by  many  public  administration  oriented  researchers.  In  fact,  the  lack  of  empowerment has resulted in ineffective decision  making at the lowest levels of implementation where  capacity has been lacking and managerial frameworks have been weak. I turn to this variable next. 

3.3.2

Inter-Governmental Support

I  define  intergovernmental  support  as  the  provision  of  sufficient  resources  by  upper  tiers  of  government  (national,  provincial)  to  lower  tiers  (municipal)  for  program  implementation.  Preliminary  research  across  municipal  Pakistan  demonstrates  that  policies  and  programs  at  higher  tiers  of  the  state  affect  municipal  service  delivery  both  directly  and  indirectly  (Shaheen,  F.,  2009).  Resource  transfers,  a  foundational  element  of  service  delivery,  indicates  whether  lower  tier  capacity  is  increased  or  at  least  sustained  by  upper  tier  policy  priorities  (Umeh  and  Andranovich,  2008).  For  example,  upper  tier  policies                                                                    
64

 Reduced tariffs for water, rudimentary facilities for sanitation and temporary shelters for pavement dwellers are some examples of very basic  services extended to the urban poor. While they are politically cheap, they at least signal some concern for the informal urban poor. 

90   

that  result  in  funding  for  lower  tier  departments  are  in  an  indicator  for  intergovernmental  support.  Upper  tier  resource  transfers  that  follow  these  policies  to  megacity  government  programs  are  another  measure  (Umeh,  O.J.  and  Andranovich,  G.,  2005;  Siddiqui  et  al,  2004).  Intragovernmental  support  and  coordination  has  been  deemed  as  critical  for  the  operation  and  sustainment  of  local  government  and  propoor  programs  (Siddiqui  et  al,  2004;  Laquian,  A.,  2006;  Devas,  N.,  2001).  As  my  research  is  particularly  interested  in  the  support  for  autonomous  megacity  government  decision  making,  patterns  of  resource  transfers  from  upper  tiers  of  the  state  are  a  key  measure.  Siddiqui  et  al  recommend  the  creation  of  urban  policy  centres  to  address  megacity  challenges  and  the  serve  a  coordinating  role  in  ensuring  that  stakeholder  interests  are  balanced  equitably.  This  measures  both  internal  and  external  coordination65.  I gathered qualitative evidence of intergovernmental relations in a number of forms. The indicators that  are  categorized  in  this  variable  include  municipal  resource  transfers;  inter  departmental  cooperation,  interview responses and support from upper tiers of the state. These components of intergovernmental  relations  are  supported  by  similar  studies  on  the  region  which  are  also  concerned  with  ongoing,  stable  and  predictable  intergovernmental  relations  (Siddiqui  et  al,  2004).  Data  on  departmental  resources,  budgets  and  financial  reports  of  megacity  government  programs  also  serve  as indicators  of the  stability  of  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements  (Umeh,  O.J.  and  Andranovich,  G.,  2005;  Siddiqui  et  al,  2004).  On  the  other  hand,  a  lack  of  intergovernmental  coordination,  demonstrated  by  the  poor  management  of  institutional  resources  also  appears  in  the  interdisciplinary  literature  (Hasan,  A.,  2002).  If  state  policy  agendas  are  preoccupied  with  large  projects,  it  is  questionable  what  capacity  would  remain  to  scale  up  or  replicate  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements.  Similarly,  there  should  be  evidence  of  funding  models  and  sustainment  plans  for  capital  budgets  as  well  as  operations  and  maintenance  budgets  (ongoing).  A  related  indicator  that  I  used  to  assess  the  state's  recognition  of  the  need  to  maintain  service delivery machinery is administrative accountability and transparency. 

                                                                  
65

 While sponsorship, resource transfers and monitoring is discussed in a separate section, the coordination with different agencies in urban  contexts is mentioned in this factor. This indicator is a reflection of the ability of state machinery to manage and extend service delivery. 

91   

3.3.3

Administrative Accountability and Transparency

The  variables  of  accountability  and  transparency  are  employed  in  tandem  to  describe  the  condition  and  functioning  of  specific  government  institutions  in  relation  to  their  interaction  with  other  state  and  non state  actors  (MUH  HDC,  2012).  The  terms  accountability  and  transparency  are  normally  employed  separately  when  referring  to  the  roles,  responsibilities,  mandates,  internal  processes  and  reporting  practices of organizations. I have coupled their usage in the South Asian municipal context for they both  serve as indicators of administrative robustness and formalized recognition between state and nonstate  actors  (Siddiqui  et  al,  2004;  Umeh  and  Andranovich,  2008).  Clear  lines  of  accountability  reduce  corruption  and  assure  citizens  that  policy  decisions  are  guided  by  societal  needs  (Mehta,  D.,  1998).  Checks  and  balances  between  elected  officials  and  bureaucratic  processes  instil  public  confidence  in  state  operations  (Blair,  2000).  Where  accountability  exists  (e.g.  departmental  mandates,  communications,  organizational  structures,  procedures  and  protocols,  etc.),  citizen  engagement  and  improved urban services results (Cavill and Sohail, 2004). Transparency represents a level of information  flow  between  all  citizens,  civil  society  and  state  actors  that  lays  the  foundation  for  participation  in  decision  making  (Mehta,  D.,  1998).  Transparency  can  also  counter  the  tendency  of  some  administrators  to  avoid  engagement  of  informal  settlements  for  fear  of  encouraging  rural  to  urban  migration  (Islam,  N.  2004).  Where  more  transparency  exists  (e.g.  information  availability,  service  delivery  reports,  service  standards, etc.), a more predictable level of engagement is expected  (Caseley, J., 2006). Transparency In  parallel  with  these  determinants,  one  expects  some  levels  of  decentralization  in  deconcentrating,  devolving and privatization with a  minimum level of central  control (Rondinelli, 1984).  The transparency  and  accountability  of  administrative  machinery  that  supports  service  delivery  machinery  is  arguably  just  as important as the political leadership (Siddiqui et al, 2000).   Indicators  of  accountability  and  transparency  were  collected  from  both  state  and  nonstate  sources.  Accountability  and  transparency  indicators  from  previous  administration  were  also  reviewed  to  assess  the  development  of  relations  between  upper  and  lower  tiers  of  the  state  particularly  in  the  sharing  of  information and pursuit of  service delivery improvements. Furthermore, I regard the ability of nonstate  actors to comment on the condition of state machinery and engage in discussion with state actors as an  indicator  of  state  accountability  for  service  delivery.  Evidence  of  this  indicator  served  to  compare  the  formalization  of  processes  through  which  state  and  nonstate  actors  engaged  to  improve  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements.  Such  information  emerged  from  nonstate  actors  engaged  in  the  92   

development  alternative  service  delivery  models.  Another  indicator  is  the  specificity  of  policies  and  programs  for  service  delivery  actors.  Clear  lines  of  responsibility  for  various  actors  which  are  agreed  upon by upper and lower tier actors, serves as an indicator for accountability. Information flows are also  valuable  for  assessing  the  commitment  of  lower  tier  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements.  I  have  categorized  the  reporting  of  audited  financial  statements,  budget  documents,  organizational  structures,  performance  reporting  and  third  party  evaluations  as  indicators  of  accountability  and  transparency.  The  level  of  citizen  engagement  or  pro  poor  engagement  in  service  delivery  is  outlined  in  the  next  comparator variable.  

3.3.4

Citizen Engagement or Pro-poor Engagement

The  state's  tendency  to  encourage  the  participation  of  informal  settlements  in  the  development  of  community  based  infrastructure  is  a  measure  of  the  state's  `willingness'  to  engage  its  constituents  (Webler  and  Tueller,  2007;  Fisher,  2005;  Umeh  and  Andranovich).  The  existence  of  a  range  of  pilot  programs  across  South  Asia's  mega  cities  illustrates  that  a  substantial  quantity  of  social  capital  exists,  that  can  be  leveraged  and  engaged  by  the  state  machinery  (Brennan,  E.,  1994).  The  success  of  such  programs  has  been  investigated  and  well  documented  in  urban  Latin  America  (Aguilar,  A.G.  and  Ward,  P.M.,  2003).  In  South  Asia,  several  programs  have  been  championed  by  the  visionary  leadership  of  specific  state  actors,  and  have  struggled  for  recognition  by  upper  and  lower  tier  counterparts  (SKAA  Â­  Zaidi,  A.,  1994,).  These  programs,  albeit  underfunded  and  limited  in  their  management  reach,  reflect  a  realization  by  state  actors  that  a  range  of  service  delivery  policy  possibilities  lie  beyond  the  ability  of  state  machinery  (Sansom,  L.,  2008).  Participation  also  reflects  the  interests  of  informal  settlements  being  empowered  and  the  avoidance  of  pseudo  participation  (Blair,  2000).  There  are  a  number  of  constraints  that  come  with  decentralization  (Siddiqui  et  al,  2000).  Competition  between  central  and  local  governments,  creation  of  power  and  privileges  for  local  elites  and  the  persistent  inequalities  between  `haves'  and  `havenots'  need  to  be  better  understood  in  specific  service  delivery  contexts.  This  promotes  the  engagement  of  community  partners  through  decentralized  models  that  disseminate  benefits  and  create  `new  public  goods'.  Social  entrepreneurs  can  leverage  these  goods  through  partnerships  at  the  most  local  levels  of  state  and  society  relations.  This  study  will  profile  some  of  these  examples later on in the case study components.  Qualitative evidence of citizen and pro poor engagement takes many forms across the three mega cities.  The  key  measure  is  how  informal  settlements  have  been  engaged  as  recipients  of  water  and  sanitation  93   

services.  `Pro  poor'  engagement  is  measured  when  there  is  some  level  of  engagement  between  state  and  nonstate  actors  (streetlevel  bureaucrats)  in  informal  settlements.  Other  indicators  of  citizen  engagement  include  public  consultations,  neighbourhood  meetings  and  outreach  initiatives  where  state  actors  have  engaged  informal  settlements.  Other  indicators  of  citizen  engagement  include  the  numbers  of  state  projects  developed  through  citizen  engagement  and  `pro  poor'  initiatives.  Collaboration  with  nonstate  actors,  particularly  civil  society,  is  common  in  such  service  delivery  efforts.  Hence,  state  engagement  is  measured  in  terms  of  how  much  responsibility  the  state  has  assumed  as  part  of  such  initiatives.  Moreover,  once  the  pilot  projects  have  reached  their  completion  date,  how  much  of  the  sustainment  (ongoing  operations  and  maintenance)  work  does  the  state  assume?  Because  the  state  often  follows  in  the  footsteps  of  pilot  projects  that  have  been  initiated  by  nonstate  actors,  it  is  only  logical  to  include  them  as  a  comparator  variable  on  their  own.  Nonstate  facilitators  of  service  delivery,  namely donors and civil society actors, account for the final group of comparator variables. 

3.3.5

Donors and Civil Society Role

Donors  and  civil  society  actors  play  a  pivotal  role  in  extending  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements  across  South  Asia's  mega  cities.  They  constitute,  arguably,  the  most  catalytic  variable  in  urban  policy  development.  Donors  and  civil  society  actors  have  increasingly  extended  support  to  informal  settlements  by  substituting  for  the  funding  and  coordinating  role  of  the  state  (Appadurai,  A.,  2001).  The  motivations  of  these  groups  have  increasingly  been  called  into  question.  For  instance,  nonstate  actors  have  long  been  accused  of  usurping  state  programs  for  their  own  profit  taking  objectives.  I  have  employed  this  comparator  variable  to  differentiate  between  the  different  types  of  donors  and  civil  society actors.  I am specifically interested in those which recognize the limitations of alternative service  delivery  models  and  the  primacy  of  state  responsibility.  Efforts  by  nonstate  actors  to  resuscitate  state  machinery  defines  the  level  of  responsibility  that  state  actors  must  assume  in  extending  services  to  informal settlements.   Evidence of donor and civil society activity has emerged largely from qualitative data sources. Part of my  primary  research  involved  semi  structured  interviews  with  donors  and  civil  society  actors.  Questions  were  posed  contrasting  their  experiences  with  state  vs.  alternative  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements.  Additional  evidence  was  gathered  through  field  observations,  published  and  unpublished  reports.  The  response  of  donor  organizations  and  civil  society  actors  measures  two  behaviours.  The  responses  of  nonstate  actors  that  are  not  engaged  directly  in  service  delivery  will  reveal  the  dynamics  94   

of  the  `development  sector'  and  how  it  is  in  fact  undermining  efforts  towards  engaging  informal  settlements.    Alternatively,  the  responses  of  those  donors  and  civil  society  actors  who  are  extending  state  services  to  informal  settlements  will  highlight  constraints  `on  the  ground'.  These  will  be  highlight  further during the three pairs of case studies for each mega city.  The purpose of employing these comparator variables is threefold. Firstly, the inclusion of variables that  reference  the  interdisciplinary  policy  literatures  has  guided  data  collection  from  a  range  of  discontinuous  sources.  Secondly,  these  variables  have  served  to  bind  the  evidence  that  has  emerged  from  across  the  three  otherwise  disparate  service  delivery  contexts.66  Finally,  these  comparator  variables  serve  as  key  determinants  of  service  delivery  outcomes  as  they  reveal  differences  in  the  behaviours within and between variables across different outcomes. Taken together, evidence captured  by  these  comparator  variables  has  allowed  for  comparisons  across  mega  cities  and  the  experiences  of  the  informal  sector  both  as  providers  and  as  recipients  of  service  delivery  (See  Appendix).  In  the  broad  discussion  of  efficient,  effective  and  equitable  service  delivery,  specific  outcomes  have  emerged  for  marginalized  communities  (Siddiqui  et  al,  2000).  Service  delivery  experiences  that  emerge  from  specific  comparator  variables  are  analyzed  to  inform  specific  upper  and  lower  tier  interventions  as  well  as  policies  and  program  development  to  better  engage  the  informal  sector.  In  order  to  ensure  that  the  right actors are pursued and engaged for data collection, the sources of information have been specified  from  the  outset.  The  final  section  of  this  chapter  outlines  the  data  sources  that  make  up  primary  and  secondary research. 

3.4 Data Sources
The  `raw  data'  that  has  supplied  the  research  design  across  the  mega  city  water  and  sanitation  contexts  and  case  studies;  has  been  drawn  from  a  number  of  specific  sources  and  provide  measures  related  to  the various comparator variables. Qualitative and quantitative data sources have been identified so that

 While the water and sanitation service delivery context is relevant to the plight of the urban poor, it is closely followed by monopolistic  trends in other service delivery contexts. The housing market is rooted in land tenure issues and is vulnerable to rising land prices. The water  sector is largely manipulated by large utility multinationals. The solid waste management sector is determined by the maturation of orbiting  interest groups and their ability to create markets. Nevertheless, the cross cutting variables that have been identified from the literature are  common to all service delivery sectors and will serve to bind the findings that emerge from field research.

information  can  be  gathered  that  accurately  assesses  the  arrangements  that  underpin  state  and  non state  engagement.  I  have  triangulated  data  between  primary  and  secondary  sources  allowing  for  comparisons across cities and contexts. Case study information has been centred on the context of most  policy  attention.  Because  the  water  and  sanitation  context  relies  upon  the  condition  of  municipal  infrastructure  and  reflects  the  condition  of  long  term  public  investment,  it  has  formed  the  comparison  of  the  two  case  studies  from  each  megacity.  The  comparison  of  responses  from  state  and  nonstate  sources  across  each  of  the  service  delivery  contexts  has  informed  the  study's  understanding  of  the  dynamics  that  influence  upper  and  lower  tier  policies  and  program  activity  in  each  megacity  (See  Appendix).   With  respect  to  state  actors,  I  approached  national/provincial  and  municipal  agencies  from  each  of  the  mega cities of analysis for information about pro poor policies and service delivery program engagement  of  the  urban  poor.  Semistructured  interviews  with  state  representatives  were  arranged  off  site,  as  outlined in the research ethics board application. Information was gathered from officers based on their  comments  in  local  media  as  well  as  reports  issued  to  nonstate  actors.  Qualitative  and  quantitative  data  sources  were  drawn  upon  to  outline  the  policy  history  (level  of  political  and  administrative  `attention'  given  to  the  urban  poor),  government  documentation  and  current  condition  of  pro  poor  policies  and  service  delivery  programs  that  target  the  informal  sector.  Specific  actors  were  engaged  to  ensure  some  level  of  comparison  between  the  different  contexts  and  mega  cities  of  study.  In  the  case  of  Mumbai,  I  triangulated  service  delivery  evidence  from  nonstate  actors  (i.e.  SI,  MM  and  SPARC),  policy  research  organizations (i.e. ICRIER) and academic sources to make up for my inability to visit the mega city.   All  nonstate  actors  as  well  as  several  media  outlets  were  engaged  for  information  about  pro  poor  policies  and  service  delivery  support/facilitation  to  the  informal  sector.  Semistructured  interviews  with  civil  society  practitioners  willing  to  participate  were  arranged  off  site  (see  research  ethics  board  application).  Published  and  unpublished  reports  were  gathered  from  specific  nonstate  actors  to  ensure  that similarly positioned civil society efforts were measured for further comparative analysis. Qualitative  information  and  baseline  quantitative  studies  were  assembled  regarding  nonstate  perspectives  about  the  condition  of  service  delivery  on  the  ground  and  constraints  to  engaging  the  informal  sector.  While  nonstate  actors  experience  a  different  set  of  constraints  in  engaging  the  informal  sector,  their  perspectives  were  triangulated  with  those  of  state  actors  to  obtain  a  more  detailed  and  unbiased  understanding of the service delivery contexts under examination. 96   

4 Research Findings Â­ Dhaka
The  first  of  my  three  results  chapters  details  findings  from  Bangladesh's  mega  city,  Dhaka.   I  begin  the  chapter  with  an  overview  of  Bangladesh's  national  policy  context  and  challenges  that  have  led  to  calls  for  `municipal  governance'  reforms.  The  chapter  continues  with  events  that  have  driven  administrative  change  from  Mughal  reign  to  colonial  rule  and  finally  the  postindependence  period.  I  then  outline  the  condition  of  service  delivery  institutions  relevant  to  municipal  Dhaka.  Research  findings  from  the  water  and  sanitation  service  delivery  context  are  then  grouped  by  comparator  variable.  The  effects  of  these  comparator  variables  on  service  delivery  are  then  illustrated  through  two  case  studies  that  detail  the  roles of state and nonstate actors in two of Dhaka's informal settlements. I conclude by returning to the  research  question  and  contrasting  the  role  of  upper  tier  and  lower  tier  state  actors  in  extending  water  and  sanitation  services  to  Dhaka's  informal  sector.  Let  us  now  turn  to  the  salient  points  of  the  national  context within which Dhaka has grown.   

4.1 Country and Municipal Overview
Bangladesh's  independence  from  Pakistan  was  followed  by  periods  of  economic  expansion  and  institutional  deterioration.    The  socio  economic  disparities  which  underpinned  the  independence  movement  remained  unaddressed  as  elected  administrations  were  faced  with  the  negative  impacts  of  flooding,  the  green  revolution  and  a  dependency  on  foreign  aid  (Ahmad  and  Townsend,  1998;  Rahman,  A.,  2004;  Islam,  N.  2008).  A  donor  supported  economy  built  upon  weak  institutional  frameworks  was  unable  to  prevent  successive  administrations  siphoning  aid  to  `non  development  related  activities'.  The  combination  of  these  factors  led  to  a  divergence  in  development  aims  and  allegations  of  corruption  within  central  government  departments  (Haq  and  Abrar,  1999;  Hossain  and  Moore,  1999;  Ahmad  and  Townsend,  1998).  Delays  began  to  undermine  donor  community  confidence,  leading  to  calls  for  increased  planning  commission  accountability,  transparency  and  efficiency  oriented  reforms  (Rahman,  A., 2004).    A  range  of  piecemeal  approaches,  ad  hoc  strategies  and  poor  communication  between  policy  making  and  implementing  departments  have  stunted  effective  policy  planning  (Rahman,  A.,  2002;  IG,  2004).  National  policy  makers  have  been  over  concerned  with  upper  tier  ministries  while  neglecting  the  condition  of  municipal  department  operations  and  performance.  As  a  result,  lower  tier  programs  have  been  disengaged  from  upper  tier  decision  making  to  the  detriment  of  urban  service  delivery.  Efforts  97   

towards  decentralization  translated  projects  and  programs  into  subordinate  offices,  where  local  service  providers  were  made  to  report  to  an  executive  office.   This  only  shifted  the  bureaucracy  to  the  lower  tier, with program formulators creating processes separate from the disseminators (Rahman, A., 2002).  Bouts  of  poor  governance  and  intergovernmental  misalignment  have  contributed  to  the  ineffectiveness  of  bureaucratic  processes  and  a  shift  away  from  donorstate  cooperation.  World  Bank  estimates  place  economic  losses  stemming  from  corruption  and  inefficiency  between  $0.5  and  $1  billion  USD/year  (WB,  2012).  This  has  contributed  to  limited  project  implementation  and  a  reduced  aid  utilization  capacity  of  government  executing  agencies  (Rahman,  A.,  2002).  The  tension  between  donors  and  state  actors  escalated  to  the  point  where  the  former  have  withheld  funds  citing  a  lack  of  progress  while  the  latter  claim  that  delays  in  disbursement  have  resulted  in  missed  milestones.  Tensions  between  state  actors  and  donor  agencies  have  left  service  delivery  inefficiencies  unaddressed,  prompting  the  informal  sector  to  resort  to  alternative  means  of  obtaining  access  to  services  (Hossain,  N.,  2009).  Policy  commentators  insist  that  reforms  must  address  program  ownership,  planning,  execution  and  resourcing  from  the  perspective of implementing agencies and lower tiers of the state in order for successful outcomes to be  realized  (Rahman,  A.,  2002).  In  the  absence  of  state  management  capacity,  capability  (accountability)  and communication, donors have turned to engaging NGOs (Rahman, A., 2002). Civil society efforts have  experienced  some  success,  but  problems  that  plague  the  larger  cities  as  Dhaka  are  insurmountable  unless communities mobilize and elevate the voices of the marginalized (Kabir and Kabeer, 2009).  The  most  obvious  policy  issue,  rising  levels  of  poverty  and  inequality,  has  only  drawn  state  neglect  (See  Appendix).  Rural to urban migration has become increasingly complex in terms of its causes and impact  on  policies  (Afsar,  1999).  The  growth  of  slums  has  been  steady  in  Dhaka.  According  to  state  documents  and  service  delivery  information,  the  population  of  informal  settlements  is  over  3.4  million  inhabitants  (DCC,  2014;  DWASA,  2014).  These  settlements  are  located  on  low  value,  marginalized,  unserviced  land  along  Dhaka's  urban  fringe.  While  the  government  does  not  recognize  the  role  of  slums  or  slum  dwellers, informal settlements drive much of Dhaka's economic activity as a site for cottage industry and  as  shelter  for  garment  workers  (largely  female)  and  low  wage  laborers  in  Dhaka's  industries  (Hussain,  1995). These challenges are embedded in Dhaka's history, to which I now turn.

4.2 Historical Overview
Dhaka's political and economic importance dates back to ancient times.  The implications of policy shifts  at  the  upper  tiers  of  the  state  on  urban  development  are  selfevident.  In  1610,  Dhaka's  strategic  importance  prompted  the  ruling  Mughal  governors  of  Bengal  to  designate  it  as  the  state  capital.  It  grew  administratively,  economically  and  militarily  as  a  port  of  trade  and  watchtower  for  regional  commerce  and  manufacturing.  Estimates  place  the  city's  population  as  high  as  900,000  during  the  peak  of  the  Mughal  period  (Ahmed,  S  U.,  2010).  In  1715,  the  capital  of  Bengal  moved  to  Murshidabad  but  Dhaka's  commerce  and  trade  remained  constant  in  the  absence  of  further  development  (Ahmed,  S  U.,  2010).  During  this  time,  indigenous  forms  of  government  which  linked  hierarchical  neighborhood  level  communities to ward level leaders were established in Dhaka's polity (Ahmed, S.U., 2010).  In  1757,  the  British  military  entered  the  region  with  political  and  economic  consequences  that  would  reshape  the  city's  economy  and  population.  By  1765,  colonial  rule  had  taken  control  of  the  entire  subcontinent.  Development in both Dhaka and Murshidabad declined as the British shifted  the regional  seat  of  power  to  Kolkata.    Soon  thereafter,  the  East  India  Company  assumed  informal  control  over  Dhaka  through  a  series  of  economic  trade  and  development  dictates.  By  1772,  the  East  India  Company  had  reorganized  most  of  the  government  structures,  stripping  the  city  of  it  of  its  administrative  functionaries  and  capabilities.    Dhaka  lost  several  key  administrative,  revenue  collections  and  judicial  departments  and  staff.  By  1765,  Dhaka's  population  had  dropped  to  450,000.   In  1801,  the  population  was  only  200,000  and  the  city  limits  contracted  to  three  and  a  half  miles  by  one  and  a  quarter  (Ahmed,  S. U., 2010).  The  city's  deterioration  furthered  as  migration  to  other  cities  contributed  to  declining  revenues  and  deteriorating  levels  of  human  development.   In  1813,  Dhaka  became  the  first  town  in  Bengal,  ironically,  where  taxation  was  imposed.  A  combination  of  insufficient  housing,  deteriorated  buildings,  poorly  maintained  sanitary  systems  and  crumbling  civic  infrastructure  served  as  a  disincentive  for  new  formal  developments.    Lower  income  groups,  left  with  no  options  for  shelter,  began  to  occupy  and  expand  poorly  built  informal  housing  settlements.   These  informal  settlements  were  carved  out  from  the  jungle  by  low  income  habitants,  while  their  wealthier  counterparts  built  solid,  well  designed  homes  along  the  rivers  (Ahmed,  S  U.,  2010).  By  1817,  poor  sanitation  had  become  a  normal  feature  of  the  city  and  cholera, among a number  of diseases, became an annual visitor.  There was no indigenous leadership to  address  these  urban  problems.  In  1823,  a  committee  of  improvement  was  established  which  concerned  99   

itself  with  creating  an  official  set  of  plans  for  Dhaka.  The  city's  deterioration  had  already  led  to  a  steady  stream of emigrants, and by 1838, the population had declined to 68,610.  By  the  mid19th  century,  substantial  deterioration  and  social  unrest67  led  to  the  ad  hoc  creation  of  administrative  and  management  structures.  The  spread  of  disease  and  poor  health  among  the  lower  income  groups  was  beginning  to  threaten  the  wealthier  communities.  In  1840,  an  urban  development  committee  was  formed,  to  develop  mandates  and  policies  for  cleanliness,  construction  and  reclamation  of  land.  Without  sufficient  funds  or  power,  services  declined  and  civil  unrest  resurfaced.  The  failure  of  the administrative approach led to a legislative approach to governing the city being adopted. The 1850s  saw  the  idea  of  a  municipal  act  introduced  in  policy  discussions.    The  lack  of  financial  resources  for  infrastructure  was  accompanied  by  the  prevalence  of  disease  and  poor  health,  miring  the  development  environment.  In  1864,  the  government  enacted  the  Dhaka  Municipal  Corporation  (DMC)  Act  by  formalizing  a  municipal  decision  making  body  and  management  structure.  Administrative  departments  including  planning,  police,  health  and  engineering  and  taxation  were  soon  followed  by  governance  by  locally  elected  representatives  and  the  ability  to  levy  taxes  and  fees68.  By  1885,  roads,  markets  and  transport infrastructure serviced the majority of the city areas (Ahmed, S U., 2010). Although delegation  of  authority  and  electoral  reforms  were  implemented  in  Dhaka,  local  networks  and  indigenous  structures  that  tied  community  governance  to  state  policy  making  did  not  survive  the  shock  of  colonial  rule  and  postcolonial  development.  In  1932,  the  Bengal  Municipal  Act  was  reformed  to  allow  for  greater  elected  representation  and  taxation/user  rates  for  Dhaka.  As  a  result  of  implementation  the  number  of  elected  local  commissioners  was  increased.    Despite  being  elected,  the  agenda  of  this  political  layer  was  at  odds  with  the  city's  informal  sector.  This  is  partially  due  to  the  erosion  of  the

 It is important to note that differences in socio economic class closely mirrored color lines among Dhaka's population.  The wealthier  residents were traders and fair skinned leaders appointed by colonial rulers.  The darker skinned residents were native Bengali's who were  migrants and formed the bulk of the local labor class. The ethnic composition of class groups would persist well into the 20th century, long after  colonial rule had formally ended.  68  Although the municipality was given the ability to levee fees, the actual collection and management of them was not actualized until much  later.  In fact, most of the fees were siphoned towards activities that catered to the wealthy and the elite, while poorer communities lacked  basic services

4.2.1

Post-Colonial Institutional Setting

During  the  latter  period  of  colonial  rule,  regional  political  and  economic  changes  reversed  the  declining  patterns of urban settlement.  In the 1900s, when the state of Bengal split, Dhaka reassumed the seat of  power  for  Eastern  Bengal  and  Assam.  Economic  growth  and  population  levels  continued  to  increase  following independence (and the exodus of Muslims and Hindus) and when the city became the regional  capital  in  1947.  Construction  increased  from  the  1950s  to  the  1960s  with  the  addition  of  government  offices  and  additional  housing  for  civil  servants.  Other  measures  were  adopted  by  the  national  government which gave municipalities more electoral power, defined values and legal status70. Although  policy  recognition  increased,  population  growth  outpaced  the  city's  capacity  to  meet  housing  and  shelter demands. The mechanization of agriculture continued to drive rural labour to Dhaka in search of  employment.  The  housing  deficit  led  to  patterns  of  polarized  habitation  and  inequitable  access  to  municipal  services.  The  clash  between  overwhelming  population  growth  and  elite  focused  development  has  led  to  conflict  between  formal  and  informal  modes  of  housing.  The  formal,  representing  the  interests  of  higher  income  groups  and  the  informal,  characterized  by  a  flexible,  elastic  and  free  flowing  labour force taking refuge in slums. Despite the growth of the latter, their deplorable condition and lack  of access to services has not been engaged by top down planning dictates.  Dhaka's  informal  settlements  have  continued  to  struggle  with  poor  development  policies  formulated  by  the  upper  tiers  of  the  state,  resulting  in  inadequate  service  delivery.  For  example,  the  1983  reform  of  the  Pourasabha  ordinance  allowed  the  central  government  to  declare  a  prospective  area  as  part  of  a  municipal  corporation  based  on  a  number  of  criteria.    However,  there  were  no  criteria  that  provided

 British indifference to the system translates into a lack of deference or engagement of the cultural features of the Panchayet system that  would have given local bodies and communities a reason to engage the more formal structures of state government.  While the British did not  actively demolish these panchayats, their marginalization and relevance resulted in their disappearance from the policy making and municipal  government theater.   70  1957 saw the abolishment of nomination and the reservation of seats for minorities in LG. 1960 saw municipalities aligned with basic  democratic values of the national government.1972 saw the drafting of the Pourasabha ordinance, leading to the Dhaka Municipal Corporation.

guidance  for  situations  where  `de  municipalisation'  might  arise,  should  an  area  wish  to  opt  out  of  the  municipal  zone  (section  154  of  the  1983  ordinance).  In  other  words,  there  is  no  formal  means  by  which  communities  can  engage  the  Dhaka  City  Corporation  (DCC)  or  the  elected  leadership  and  communicate  their  desire  to  be  excluded  from  Dhaka's  municipal  jurisdiction.  This  gap  in  political  and  administrative  engagement  represents  the  absence  of  understanding  regarding  Dhaka's  lack  of  capacity  and  capability  in achieving equitable development.   Although  the  DCC  was  given  the  authority  to  reframe  electoral  structures,  it  remained  powerless  in  resolving  the  administrative  and  legislative  shortcomings  in  the  city's  overall  governance  framework.   In  1990, the DCC's mayors and ward commissioners were directly elected on the basis of franchise, with all  wards  divided  into  zones  fixed  by  the  central  government.  This  legal  framework  has  remained  challenged  as  many  of  the  bylaws  dated  back  to  colonialism  require  central  government  approval  to  update  them.  In  the  meantime,  old  rules  and  regulations  are  used  for  political  convenience  with  little  flexibility  for  alternatives.  Finally,  many  by  laws  are  dealing  with  organizations  and  state  entities  over  which  DCC  has  no  control.  In  light  of  this  confusing  and  contradictory  policy  context,  standing  orders  from central government supersede any of the DCC's internally generated decisions.  The central government in Bangladesh holds a disproportionate amount of power over Dhaka, given the  history  of  clientpatron  politics  and  the  overshadowing  of  ideology  by  selfinterest  and  promotion  (BRAC, 2008).  Although the DCC depends financially on the central government, there is no oversight by  the  latter  on  the  operations  of  departments  and  officers71.  This  is  complicated  by  the  frequent  transfers  of  higher  level  officials  to  other  portfolios  and  the  endless  allegations  with  each  deeming  the  other  incompetent.  Most  of  the  DCC's  key  decisions  on  `municipalisation',  `de  municipalisation',  mayoral  standing,  functions,  budgets,  inspections,  procedural  annulments  and  postings  (appointments  of

 Ahmed and Khan provide a detailed summary of the evolution of Bangladesh's bureaucracy and the characteristics of 'over developed' cadres  that have struggled with political elements.  This study will not investigate the inner workings of the bureaucracy, except but to acknowledge its  similarities to the Indian and Pakistani bureaucracies.  The bureaucracy is characterized by centralization, military bureaucratic dominance, a  passion for rank, caste differentiation of officials and a lack of subsystem autonomy.  One key difference in Bangladesh is that the civil  bureaucracy has been punished politically with independence and the focus of political development has increasingly been on central  government dynamics with political authority as determined by party politics (Subramaniam, P., 1998).

officers)  are  managed  through  the  central  government.  City  feedback  is  not  factored  into  GoB  plans  for  Dhaka  and  even  donor  negotiations  must  be  managed  through  the  central  government.    Multi  stakeholder  processes  add  to  the  already  tense  relations  between  lower  tier  (DCC)  and  upper  tier  (GoB)  actors.    Given  the  politicized  nature  of  intergovernmental  relations  it  is  not  surprising  that  partisan  politics  have  disrupted  service  delivery.  The  result  is  that  proposed  solutions  to  municipal  problems  are  never institutionalized and discontinuous, one off initiatives persists.    Intergovernmental  tensions  have  been  accompanied  by  calls  for  decentralization,  particularly  from  the  military,  whose  exercises  in  local  area  management  demonstrate  the  benefits  of  local  government.   However,  reforms  have  been  challenged  on  the  grounds  of  poor  performance,  capacity  and  insufficient  oversight  in  a  culture  of  subservience  (Huque,  2011).  Critics  point  to  such  arguments  as  a  basis  for  re  concentrating  power  at  upper  tiers  of  the  state.  For  instance,  when  the  lowest  levels  of  local  government  were  given  authority  to  generate  revenue  but  were  found  to  be  incapable  of  collections,  a  higher  tier  was  charged  with  revenue  generation  (Wahhab,  M.A.,  2002).    Overall,  the  administrative  system  in  Bangladesh  has  followed  the  roots  of  colonial  rule  where  the  centre  had  near  absolute  authority  over  the  functions  and  dynamics  that  shaped  the  subservient  local  government  (Wahhab,  M.A.,  2002).  The  aspirations,  mobility  and  superiority  of  upper  tier  generalists  vs.  lower  tier  specialists  alienate the lower tiers more than policy discontinuities (Zafarullah and Khan, 2009).  The  impressions  of  postcolonial  municipal  development  have  left  city  governments  suffocated  by  party  politics,  inefficiencies  and  bloated  upper  tiers  of  the  GoB  (BRAC,  2008;  Munith,  C.M.,  2007).    I  must  emphasize  that  the  challenges  facing  local  governance  (falling  revenues,  central  control,  resource  constraints,  corruption,  inefficiencies,  misuse  of  public  funds  and  downsizing)  have  at  least  been  engaged by a vibrant civil society sector.  This sector has concentrated their efforts at facilitating service  delivery  in  Dhaka  through  acquiring,  empowering  and  sustaining  competent  staff  and  funding  from  a  range  of  domestic  and  largely  international  donors  (Islam,  N.,  2000).    Their  contributions  emerge  in  various aspects of Dhaka's institutional landscape.  The challenges that have faced the DCC and adjacent  institutions are outlined in the next section. 

4.2.2

The condition of municipal institutions

Over one hundred political and administrative institutions under  the elected  mayor and state appointed  CEO,  are  directly  or  indirectly  involved  in  the  provision  of  services  to  Dhaka  (Metropolis,  2009).  Policy  103   

research  points  to  the  underperformance  of  upper  tier  planning  bodies  and  their  lack  of  support  for  lower  tier  mandates  and  tasks  (Siddiqui  et  al,  2000;  Islam,  N.,  2008).  Planning  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Metropolitan  Region  of  Dhaka  (MRD)  and  the  central  government's  capital  development  body,  RAJUK.  The  institution  has  faced  criticism  for  corrupt,  opaque,  obsolete  and  elitist  planning  policies  that  cater  only  to  the  wealthy  (Islam,  N.,  2000,  WB,  2007).  Plans  have  been  drafted  only  to  face  delays,  further  withholding resources from lower tier departments. Other services of these upper tier actors include the  construction  and  maintenance  of  roads,  bridges,  culverts,  drains  and  various  public  utility  works.    The  Dhaka  City  Corporation  (DCC)  is  responsible  for  the  revitalization  and  improvement  of  slum  areas,  ensuring  civic  amenities  for  city  dwellers,  delivering  education,  health  and  sanitary  facilities,  disposing  waste,  ensuring  a  regulator  civic  order,  encouraging  the  growth  of  ICI  and  residential  areas,  management  of  dangerous  trades,  supervising  new  building  and  construction,  maintaining  graveyards,  burial  grounds,  supplying  drinking  water,  maintaining  bazaars,  pounds  for  stray  animals  and  parks  for  recreation. The reality is that only a few of these services are provided by lower tier departments to any  significant  degree.  For  example,  the  DCC's  solid  waste  management  department  has  the  resources  to  collect  only  half  of  the  solid  waste  generated  by  Dhaka's  residents.  The  other  half  is  collected  at  the  household  level  by  informal  sector  waste  collectors  and  picked  up  by  private  or  city  waste  management  vehicles.  Policy  evidence  did  not  reveal  any  recognition  by  state  actors  for  the  informal  sector  waste  collectors.   The  management  and  operations  of  the  DCC  have  been  fraught  with  corruption,  nepotism  and  misalignment.  Elections  are  governed  by  a  commission  that  lacks  resources  to  fairly  and  ethically  oversee  the  fair  administration  of  national,  provincial  and  municipal  elections  (Islam,  2005).  Procedures  are  formalities  and  are  routinely  violated  with  legal  action  rarely  taken  to  the  courts.  As  a  result,  local  body  elections  have  deteriorated  into  arenas  for  competing  elite  interests.  The  wards  which  divide  the  city  are  dominated  by  elected  officials,  bureaucrats  and  industrialists;  many  who  are  represented  by  local  `mastaans'.  The  neighborhood  `mastaans'  (also  referred  to  as  slum  lords)  extract  rents,  bribes  and  protection  money  from  powerless  slum  dwellers.  This  enables  them  to  amass  power  and  fund  other  businesses  (often  illegal)  furthering  their  accounts  of  illegal  money.  It  is  therefore  unsurprising  that  the  wealthier  have  been  found  to  be  more  likely  to  get  elected  (Siddiqui  et  al,  2000).   Management  within  the  DCC  is  also  polarized  between  appointed  officers  and  district  officials  who  are  either  under  resourced  or  unaccountable  to  their  constituents.  The  administrative  heads  of  the  main  departments  (RAJUK,  DWASA,  DESA,  DPHE  and  Health  Services)  form  a  number  of  standing  committees  which  are  104   

largely  defunct  as  their  recommendations  are  unheard  by  the  elected/appointed  officials.  This  leads  to  uninformed  decision  making,  poor  performance  and  inefficiency.  Efforts  towards  decentralization  led  to  the  establishment  of  zonal  offices  and  Ward  Commissioners  (WCs),  which  remain  without  power  or  alignment  with  other  administrative  offices.  Elected  officials  at  this  lowest  level  tend  to  be  uneducated,  inexperienced  in  civic  administration  and  possess  little  training  in  public  (leave  alone  private)  sector  operations.  Ninety  percent of WC's are politically affiliated with  national parties or `mastaans' (Siddiqui  et  al,  2004).  Insecurity  provides  yet  another  barrier  to  the  transparent  and  accountable  administration  of  state  functions  and  service  delivery  (Rahman,  M.  et  al,  2003).  Several  surveys  revealed  that  many  of  the  WCs  see  the  poor  as  part  of  the  problem  and  slums  are  simply  a  nuisance  where  illegal  occupations  are an inconvenience for the residents.   The  capacity  and  capability  of  DCC's  staff  also  lags  behind  the  demands  of  infrastructure  expansion.  Available  resources  intended  for  development  are  absorbed  by  salaries,  allowances  and  repairs.  More  specifically,  the  bloated  ranks  of  senior  staff  divert  budgetary  allocations  away  from  frontline  service  delivery  needs.  Revenues  streams  are  dependent  on  a  few  sources  and  have  not  been  revisited  or  updated  for  several  years.  Assets  owned  by  DCC  have  been  captured  by  private  interests  whom  upper  tier  actors  fear  aggravating72.  Similarly,  the  DCC  labour  force  is  characterized  by  inefficiencies  and  ineffectiveness,  where  corruption  and  graft  is  rampant.  Budgetary  allocations  are  driven  by  crisis  situations  and  resource  allocations  and  outcomes  are  rarely  audited.  Seventy  percent  of  the  DCC's  employees  are  temporary  hires  and  have  their  contracts  renewed  through  a  politicized  process  of  manoeuvring with local `mastaans'. The combination of politicized appointments and poor performance  has resulted in weak organizational values and a culture of corruption. As a result, few opportunities are  offered  for  training,  advancement  or  promotion  (Siddiqui  et  al,  2004).  These  challenges  of  capacity  and  capability were found across the literature on Dhaka's municipal departments.

 The asset holdings of 'mastaans' representing politicians, bureaucrats and industrial elites strangle Dhaka's real polity. Unfortunately, there is  little political momentum to rebalance the power over services from the ground up. Networks of upper tier actors are stronger than those at  the lower tiers. 

105   

Many  of  Dhaka's  municipal  departments  struggle  with  a  lack  of  upper  tier  support  and  resources.  The  Dhaka  Metropolitan  Police  (DMP)  department  has  struggled  with  its  responsibility  for  maintaining  law  and  order,  security  and  traffic  across  the  city.  Critics  point  out  that  the  number  of  policemen  is  inadequate  and  officers  are  ill  equipped,  hence  the  DMP's  inability  to  control  crime  effectively.    They  also  point  to  the  lack  of  capacity  of  the  Chief  Metro  Magistrates  Court.  Slum  dwellers  admit  to  the  increase  in  insecurity  as  a  major  concern  rather  than  obtaining  a  sufficient  economic  income  (BRAC,  2007).  Construction  in  Dhaka  is  managed  by  three  upper  tier  directorates  (HSD,  RHD  and  RAJUK)  all  which  have  limited  interaction  with  the  lower  tier  DCC  in  the  design  of  capital  projects.  Furthermore,  these  three  groups  are  focused  on  providing  housing  to  ten  percent  of  Dhaka's  wealthy  (Seraj,  TM  and  Alam,  S.  1991;  WB,  1999).  Transportation  assets  and  systems  are  managed  by  the  BRTC,  with  most  attention  paid  to  facilitating  automobile  traffic  rather  than  managing  public  transit,  in  the  hands  of  private  operators.  Power  distribution  assets  in  gas  and  electricity  have  also  failed  to  keep  up  with  demand,  resulting  in  black  outs  and  revenue  losses  in  the  order  of  forty  percent.  A  similar  experience  in  managing infrastructure backlogs exists within the telecommunications department.  Since 1963, the Dhaka Water and Sewerage Authority (DWASA)  have been mandated with  the provision  of  water  and  sewage  services  to  the  city.  The  system  is  beset  with  problems,  including:  over  forty  percent  unaccountedforwater  and  uncontrolled  demand.  Over  eighty  two  percent  of  the  city's  water  supply  is  ground  water  based,  the  table  of  which  is  falling  at  a  rate  of  two  to  three  meters  per  year.   There is a sub optimal system of small diameter pipes, fifty percent of which will have ceased to function  as  of  2013.  Illegal  connections  and  false  billing  have  also  impaired  DWASA's  financial  health.  Eighty  five  percent  of  poor  households  have  no  access  to  drainage  or  septic  facilities  and  twenty  percent  of  poor  households  are  connected  to  the  sewage  system  (WB,  1999).  The  DCC  has  recently  been  more  cooperative  in  facilitating  the  extension  of  water  and  sanitation  services  to  the  informal  sector  (DSK,  2011). DWASA institutional reforms and infrastructure rehabilitation are supported by a range of donors  and civil society actors, in an effort to ensure the sustainment of public water (ADB, 2011; DSK, 2013). 

4.2.3

Calls for Political and Administrative Reforms

Dhaka's political and administrative weaknesses have drawn numerous calls for reforms. However, most  of  the  discussions  remain  framed  by  upper  tier  actors.  For  example,  the  coordination  committees  that  were  started  in  the  late  1990s  were  irregular  and  were  dominated  by  civil  servants  who  were  not  concerned  with  improved  coordination  or  service  delivery  effectiveness  (Islam  et  al,  2001;  McCarney  106   

and  Stren,  2001).  Most  of  Bangladesh's  governance  discussions  have  seen  national  concern  eclipse  those  of  the  local  (Siddiqui  et  al,  2000).  Ordinary  decisions  are  entrenched  in  ministerial  dealings  and  portfolios,  rather  than  follow  due  procedure  (Muhith,  A.M.,  2007).   Policy  researchers  have  pointed  to  the  structural  concerns  nested  in  the  relationship  between  the  mayor  and  the  central  government,  exacerbated  by management and institutional inadequacies, personnel and capacity deficiencies, lack of  motivation,  corruption  and  unethical  labor  and  dishonest  leadership  (Islam  et  al,  2001).  In  response,  central  government  functionaries  have  stripped  their  lower  tier  counterparts  in  the  DCC  of  resources  while  burdening  them  with  more  responsibilities73.  Nonstate  actors  at  the  lower  tiers  have  provided  support to targeted groups, leading to subsidization of other development activities (Banuri et al, 2004).  However,  independent  solutions  cannot  address  the  constraints  of  intergovernmental  relations  and  local  capacity  building  (SIddiqui,  K.,  1998).  Others  recommend  the  creation  of  a  metropolitan  government  which  oversees  the  entire  jurisdiction  and  has  the  autonomy  to  make  necessary  decisions.  A similar model would see the creation of a two tiered government where the upper tier's role is simply  distributive  and  monitoring,  while  the  service  delivery  and  operational  powers  lie  in  the  lower  tiers  (Ahmed, S., 2010).   Alternative  models  based  on  increased  community  engagement  are  proposed  by  nonstate  actors,  in  light  of  persistent  institutional  problems,  service  delivery  shortcomings  and  a  weak  DCC  (BCAS,  BRAC  and  ADB,  1998).  Evidence  based  recommendations  include  the  delegation  of  revenue  generating  authority,  service  delivery  power  to  the  neighborhood  level,  citizen  oversight  in  planning,  formulation  and  execution  of  DCC  services  (Munith,  A.M.,  2007;  Brocklerby  and  Hobley,  2003).  Donors  concur  with  such  recommendations,  adding  the  need  for  capable  and  wellresourced  DCC  staff  along  with  specific  `Terms of Reference' for nonstate actors (ADB, 1998). Such measures would address the lack of capacity  building  and  devolution  to  lower  tiers  of  government  (Munich,  C.H.,  2007;  AminuRahman,  1992).  It  would  also  address  the  lack  of  vertical  and  horizontal  communication  between  lower  tier  departments,                                                                    
  During  the  Hanif  administration,  the  AL  party  leader  elected  by  the  people  approached  both  BNP  and  AL  led  governments  with  a  decentralization model which would improve city governance and he received no response, illustrating the conflict between the mayor and the  ministry appointed CEO.

low  morale  and  incorporate  the  service  delivery  expectations  of  the  poor  (Zafarullah  and  Mohabbat  Khan, 2007; Jahan, 2012; Narayan and Zaman, 2009). Given the deadlock between upper and lower tiers  of  the  state,  nonstate  actors  (who  work  closely  with  the  informal  sector)  have  been  identified  by  most  policy  researchers  as  the  most  effective  agents  of  change.  In  order  to  appreciate  the  needs  at  the  lower  tiers,  as  represented  by  both  state  and  nonstate  actors,  let  us  now  turn  to  first  service  delivery  context  of study.  

4.3 The Water and Sanitation Context
Dhaka's  water  and  sanitation  context  illustrates  the  challenges  facing  lower  tier  actors  in  pursuit  of  mandated  engagement  of  vulnerable  communities.  Following  independence  in  1971,  the  government  pushed  DWASA  for  the  development  of  the  country's  groundwater  supply  and  improvement  of  its  sanitation  systems.  A  falling  water  table  and  deteriorating  system  led  to  deeper  drilling  for  well  water  and  arsenic  contamination.  By  the  turn  of  the  century,  an  institutional  turnaround  program  has  led  to  a  steady  reduction  in  the  reliance  on  groundwater  through  the  development  of  surface  water  treatment  infrastructure (DWASA, 2014). Unfortunately, many of the poor are beyond the reach of the utility. Over  fifty  percent  of  slum  dwellers  have  no  access  to  DWASA  managed  sources  of  water  and  resort  to  paying  vendors very high prices for illegal access supply. Service delivery to the informal sector has been eroded  as  1/3rd  of  Dhaka's  residents  reside  in  areas  under  serviced  by  the  utility.  Six  percent  of  slum  dwellers  are served by tube wells with the rest accessing water from unsanitary sources.   The  situation  is  even  more  precarious  with  regard  to  sanitation  coverage.  Studies  by  the  CUS  in  1990  and  JICA  in  1991  reveal  that  only  twenty  five  percent  of  city  population  was  serviced  by  DWASA  at  that  time.   Half  of  Dhaka's  3.4  million  slum  dwellers  have  no  access  to  sanitary  systems  (CUS,  2005;  DWASA,  2014).  High  rises  in  the  dense  urban  core  have  latrines  at  slum,  drain,  storm  sewer  or  water  pond  connections,  which  results  in  surcharges  (and  thirty  percent  increases  in  cases  of  gastro  intestinal  diseases)  of  the  sewer  system  during  flooding,  especially  in  low  lying  slum  settlements  (WSSCC,  2011;  Wateraid,  2009).  By  2004,  DWASA  had  covered  thirty  percent  of  the  city  in  terms  of  sewage  coverage  (BCAS, 2004; WaterAid, 2010).  The DCC has been trying to build more public toilets but the lack of space  has  presented  planners  with  an  ongoing  problem.   DWASA  has  indicated  that  their  dominant  concern  is  with  ensuring  water  supply  and  accelerating  cost  recoveries  on  nonrevenue  water  (WSSCC,  2011;  DWASA, 2013). Most of DWASA's challenges are linked to unpaid bills, pilferage through organized crime  and  implementation  of  a  turnaround  program  (DWASA,  2014).  Unfortunately,  ambiguities  within  the  108   

land  ownership  market  (as  discussed  earlier)  and  a  number  of  external  and  `higher  tier  forces'  prevent  the  efficient  enforcement  of  public  water  supply.  The  market  also  sells  bottled  water  to  which  DWASA  has  responded  with  their  own  brand  of  bottled  water  which  is  available  at  a  subsidized  rate,  much  less  than other market players.  In  spite  of  these  challenges,  there  are  efforts  by  lower  tier  nonstate  actors  (NGOs  and  CBOs)  to  extend  service  to  the  informal  sector.  NGOs  have  advocated  for  slum  dweller  water  connections  by  engaging  lower  tier  departments  such  as  DWASA  and  the  DCC,  on  behalf  of  slum  dweller  CBOs.  NGOs  have  also  educated  CBOs  on  sanitation  solutions.  Such  assistance  has  resulted  in  the  establishment  of  municipal  water  points  or  tube  wells.  Aside  from  providing  technical  assistance,  these  NGOs  have  enabled  slum  communities  to  navigate  the  labyrinth  of  departmental  processes  and  demand  services.  Fortunately  for  Dhaka's slum dwellers, the water utility has made it a priority to increase revenue recovery by extending  service  delivery  to  stakeholders  who  do  not  have  formal  connections.  As  state  and  nonstate  actors  are  cognizant  of  the  challenges  of  unaccounted  for  water,  NGOs  have  recently  been  engaged  with  DWASA  as  intermediaries  to  ensure  that  some  level  of  service  is  extended  to  a  `ready  to  pay'  informal  sector  (Islam, N., 2005). Despite  these efforts,  a number of  challenges remain to ensuring water and sanitation  services  to  the  informal  sector  in  Dhaka.    Let  us  now  turn  to  these  challenges  as  categorized  by  the  following comparator variables. 

4.3.1

Political representation

Primary  and  secondary  research  revealed  little,  if  any  evidence  of  support  by  elected  officials  for  extending  water  and  sanitation  services  to  Dhaka's  slums.  Policy  commentators  and  CBO  leaders  have  long  accused  politicians  of  infrastructure  planning  for  service  to  wealthier  constituents  while  neglecting  lower  income  groups  (DSK,  2013;  CUS,  2008).  This  bias  is  mirrored  in  society,  where  upper  and  middle  class  citizen  groups  persistently  lobby  politicians  to  restrict  service  provision  to  adjacent  slums  as  they  fear  service  delivery  loss  to  their  enclaves.  This  behaviour  persists  despite  the  reliance  of  higher  income  communities  on  the  informal  sector  for  services  (McLaren  et  al,  2008).  Although  upper  tier  policies 

109   

recognize  water  as  a  right,  interviews  with  slum  dwellers  and  representative  CBOs  point  to  a  history  of  political  neglect  with  respect  to  the  extension  of  services  to  their  communities.  CBO  leaders  have  complained  `elected  officials  from  the  federal  and  municipal  governments  only  come  during  election  time.   Otherwise,  they  are  nowhere  to  be  seen.'74  A  few  government  documents  mention  engaging  the  informal sector but there has been little progress in terms of implementation.   Primary  research  and  interview  data  revealed  a  political  economy  of  service  delivery  to  the  informal  sector.   NGO  and  CBO  leaders  pointed  to  a  number  of  illegal  connections  that  are  exploited  by  criminal  networks  that  pilfer  the  public  supply  and  resell  extracted  water  for  10  to  15  times  the  DWASA  tariff.  In  fact,  elected  officials  are  enabling  the  network  of  `mastaans'  who  have  expropriated  public  hydrants  by  paying off DWASA staff (DSK, 2011).  In many situations, these `mastaans' are propped up by illegal land  lords  with  ties  to  political  and  economic  leaders.  NGO  representatives  pointed  out,  in  referring  to  several informal settlements, that `the `mastaans' extract rents from slum dwellers, with funds lining the  pockets  of  Dhaka's  elite.  It  is  dangerous  to  engage  slum  dwellers  on  illegally  appropriate  private  property,  which  is  owned  by  `mastaans',  as  compared  to  public  lands  where  ownership  is  contentious,  but  at  least  within  the  government  realm.'  When  asked  about  their  main  challenges,  NGO  actors  responded  `Our  two  main  challenges  are  `mastaans'  and  the  threat  of  eviction.  The  pockets  of  elite  politicians and bureaucrats are lined while lower level DWASA and police staff are threatened or paid to  look  the  other  way.'75  The  manipulation  of  water  markets  by  political  leaders  and  their  networks  of  `mastaans'  also  allow  them  to  manipulate  slum  power  structures  for  profits  (Akash  and  Singha,  2011).  Slum  dwellers  are  forced  to  pay  for  illegal  supplies  of  water  and  are  denied  piped  access  which  would  contribute  to  the  case  for  tenure  and  avoid  resettlement  and  the  marginalization  of  slum  to  pavement  dweller  (Nawaz,  T.,  2002).  Policy  evidence  also  shows  that  programs  intended  for  the  hardcore  poor  in  sanitation,  are  captured  by  upper  income  groups  represented  by  upper  tier  state  actors  (BCAS,  2013;  Islam,  N.,  2005).   According  to  a  study  of  subsidies,  estimates  are  that  as  much  as  thirty  three  to  fifty  percent  of  the  twenty  percent  of  the  annual  development  program  block  grants  are  captured  by  the

nonpoor.  This is due to lack of awareness of the poor of these programs, caste system, kinship, political  liaisons  and  favouritism,  local  power  politics  and  communication  influences  of  free  services,  high  barriers to obtaining hardware and  materials, lack of effective  GOB monitoring, inability to  interact with  local  government,  etc.  (Ziaul  Kabir,  A.B.M.,  2008).  Hence,  although  there  is  a  substantial  level  of  policy  formalism, little implementation exists to realize positive outcomes for the informal sector.  Interviews with nonstate actors revealed a common perception that elected officials are only interested  in sustaining the status quo and `votes for services'. A prominent researcher in Dhaka's NGO community  commented  `Mayors  and  other  senior  DCC  officials  have  travelled  to  other  cities  to  see  how  tax  collection  and  other  municipal  administrations  are  run.   However,  when  they  return,  nothing  changes.  When challenged, they complain of not having substantial power to incur change'76. A donor focused on  pavement  dweller  shelters  also  complained  `Working  with  the  DCC  is  difficult  and  they  see  NGOs  as  a  threat.  Although  we  have  established  good  relations  with  frontline  DCC  officers,  it  is  still  hard  to  influence senior officials in the federal government.'77  Slum dwellers and their  communities  have grown  cynical and tired of votes for services (particularly with respect to housing and shelter) are now realizing  their  rights  to  services  from  DWASA  as  an  administrative  entity.    In  fact  slum  dwellers  are  politically  mobilizing  Vis  a  Vis  selfhelp  NGOs.  The  political  influence  of  landlords,  supported  by  local  elites  and  politicians,  is  countered  by  NGOs  and  slum  dweller  CBOs  who  strive  to  unite  otherwise  fragmented  informal  sector  groups.  Donors  also  conceded  that  the  presence  of  NGOs  has  mitigated  the  lack  of  political  representation  by  elected  officials,  but  mobilizing  and  sustaining  CBO  resilience  (Wateraid,  2010).  In  order  to  move  nonstate  actors  beyond  simply  advocacy,  overcoming  the  hurdles  to  engaging  the lower tier city actors is needed.  I turn to this variable next.

Administrative accountability/transparency

Primary  and  secondary  policy  evidence  regarding  the  accountability  and  transparency  of  water  and  sanitation  service  delivery  across  Dhaka  has  been  mixed.  Although  Dhaka's  sewer  infrastructure  has

been  in  place  since  1923,  it  has  not  been  expanded  to  serve  the  entire  north  end  of  the  city.   Initially,  management  of  the  water  and  sanitation  infrastructure  fell  under  the  authority  of  the  DCC.  As  the  DCC  manages  a  number  of  the  city's  departments,  water  and  sanitation  infrastructure  investments  were  underestimated  and  delayed.  As  a  result,  only  eighteen  percent  of  the  sewage  generated  by  the  entire  population  reached  the  city's  only  treatment  plant.  Evidence  also  points  to  DCC  neglect  regarding  the  maintenance of public latrines for slum dwellers (Rahman, M. et al, 2003). Unsurprisingly the practice of  open  defecation  continues  to  this  day,  spreading  disease.    The  drainage  system  has  also  remained  unattended  to,  resulting  in  the  prevalence  of  waterborne  disease  during  periods  of  flooding  (Siddiqui  et  al,  2000).  NGOs  active  in  other  sectors,  such  as  solid  waste  collection,  have  also  complained  of  the  lack  of  cooperation  by  the  DCC.  For  instance,  a  social  entrepreneur  who  recently  established  a  waste  collection  and  recycling  facility  commented  `  the  DCC  calls  this  effort  a  partnership,  when  really  it  is  cooperation as the DCC is not sharing in the risk or taking any role in profit or loss with us.'78  Since  being  mandated  with  the  management  of  the  city's  water,  wastewater  and  storm  water  responsibilities  in  1996,  DWASA  (an  autonomous  body)  has  exhibited  increased  transparency  through  reporting  and  accountability  for  services.  DWASA  responsibilities  include  the  operation  of  tube  wells,  sustaining  water  lines  and  service  connections  to  Dhaka  and  the  surrounding  suburbs  of  Narayangonj  and  Gazipur  (DWASA,  2000;  CFSD,  2001).  Financial  officers  for  DWASA  respond  `water  shortages  to  informal  settlements  have  persisted  as  DWASA  has  only  been  able  to  supply  eighty  percent  of  demand.'79    Projections  are  that  a  net  deficit  of  2,750  MLD  will  be  experienced  by  2020  (Faisal  and  Ahmed,  2000).  This  is  due  in  large  part  to  illegal  use  of  public  hydrants  and  the  suction  which  draws  corroded  material  into  supply  lines,  thereby  contaminating  them  (CFSD,  2001).  Sewerage  coverage  has  increased  to  thirty  eight  percent  of  the  city  (DWASA,  2014).  Nevertheless,  over  forty  percent  of  the  population are on individual septic tanks (Rahman, M. et al, 2003). The Dhaka storm water management  plan  is  to  recharge  aquifers.  Buildings  that  are  now  approved  by  RAJUK,  must  have  storm  water  management,  rainwater  harvesting  and  groundwater  recharge  features  installed  (DWASA,  2014).  Over

thirty  three  percent  of  DWASA  revenue  goes  to  paying  electricity  bills,  and  total  revenue  during  the  most  recent  years  has  7  billion  Taka.  Ideally,  DWASA  authorities  want  the  tariff  to  be  raised  to  13  to  14  Taka per 1,000 litres, up from the current 6 Taka per 1,000 litres (DWASA, 2014).   In  order  to  make  the  improvements  necessary  to  strategic  management,  the  utility  has  embarked  on  a  `Dhaka  WASA  Turnaround  Program'  to  increase  revenue  recovery  and  extend  services  to  the  informal  sector'80.  Measures  have  been  taken  by  DWASA  to  reduce  operational  costs,  increase  production  and  supply  and  extend  more  coverage  to  informal  sector  communities.  DWASA  now  manufactures  its  own  line  of  bottled  water,  although  it  is  not  as  widely  promoted  (DWASA,  2013).  Annual  reports  are  readily  available  from  DWASA  through  their  website  and  through  donor  publications  (DWASA,  2010;  DWASA,  2011).  Institutional  reform  projects  are  being  implemented  and  KPIs  are  being  used  to  show  return  on  capacity  building  of  the  utility  (WASA,  2014).  The  current  Managing  Director  reports  `as  a  result  of  the  turnaround  program, service delivery across the city  has improved. Water production  has increased and  nonrevenue  water  has  dropped  from  forty  to  twenty  five  percent.  This  has  been  possible  through  the  laying  of  trenchless  pipe  as  well  as  offering  discount  pricing  to  replace  illegal  lines  with  DWASA  authorized  lines.'81  In  addition  to  the  strategic  issues,  operational  improvements  include  complaint  policies,  improved  operating  ratios  (0.9  to  0.66),  real  time  billing  (with  tolerances  to  optimize  collections)  and  slum  engagement.  One  of  DWASA's  strategic  objectives  is  to  have  all  three  million  slum  dwellers  engaged  by  2015.  The  Director  of  Revenue  quipped  during  an  interview  `we  at  DWASA  know  that  we  cannot  engage  even  a  fraction  of  the  informal  settlements.  We  need  the  technical  and  social  expertise  of  NGOs  to  accomplish  this.'82  Engagement  through  nonstate  actors  including  UNICEF  and  a  number  of  NGOs  has  improved  coverage  for  DWASA  (DWASA,  2014).  DWASA  has  received  several  awards  for  being  one  of  the  best  managed  public  sector  utilities  in  Asia  (DWASA,  2013).  Future  plans 

                                                                  
 Key elements of this program include sustainability, large investment attraction, shift reliance on underground water to surface water,  establish a good director team, develop regular bench marking and empower leadership so that we can move from reactive to proactive  management. It started locally from within, but when management showed serious concern for institutional strengthening, it attracted donor  funding from the Dutch and then the ADB. Ironically, cost effective management, increased service delivery reach and institutional reform and  change has facilitated the access of water to the poor.    81  Interview with Dhaka Water and Sanitation Authority Managing Director, Lahore, December 16th, 2013  82  Interview with Dhaka Water and Sanitation Authority Revenue Director, Dhaka, December 16th, 2013

include  constructing  additional  treatment  plants,  establishing  automatic  billing,  introducing  electronic  account management and work management systems.   Despite  receiving  numerous  accolades,  DWASA's  institutional  capacity  is  in  need  of  external  assistance.  DWASA lacks the internal  communication necessary to optimizing service delivery (whether  it is internal  or  engaging  with  civil  society).  DWASA  is  not  able  to  engage  land  developers  nor  do  they  formalize  the  tenure  of  property,  which  has  left  gaps  in  land  control  to  the  detriment  of  the  utility.  The  lack  of  information  also  reflects  poor  intergovernmental  cooperation  in  the  absence  of  regular  and  predictable  information flows (Rahman and Mallick, 2003). Of the five hundred and sixteen permissions given to DSK  for  water  point  set  up,  one  hundred  and  twenty  three  water  points  have  been  evicted  and  three  hundred  and  ninety  three  are  in  operation  (Akash  and  Singha,  2011).  Senior  management  realizes  that  when  DWASA  is  unable  to  establish  piped  water  for  slum  dwellers,  public  water  is  obtained  through  middle  men  at  a  higher  price  (SIddiqui  et  al,  2000).  While  technical  assistance  follows  from  some  donor  activities,  DWASA  is  devoid  of  staff  development,  human  resources  or  institutional  development  plans.  This leaves the frontline staff without support and prone to threats, graft and petty corruption (Rahman,  M., et al, 2003). 010). DWASA officials also indicate that a lack of engagement with other utility partners  who  do  unplanned  development  is  a  problem.  Departments  such  as  DESA,  Tita  Gas  ad  DCC  break  their  own  regulations  causing  problems  on  sanitation  collection  and  treatment.  At  present,  the  North  Dhaka  System  Sewage  Master  Plan  Â­  is  worth  TK  22  billion  and  will  be  split  into  two  phases.   ADB  funding  is  driving this initiative. (Rahman, M. et al, 2003)  Overall, there has been a noticeable improvement in the transparency of information and accountability  taken  by  DWASA.  The  management  of  DWASA  are,  according  to  DSK,  in  favour  of  pro  poor  initiatives  that  engage  the  informal  sector  slums.  Several  NGO  advocacy  officers  commented  `We  have  better  success  engaging  DWASA's  frontline  officers  first  when  we  want  to  launch  a  program.  Once  they  are  on  board,  then  we  find  it  easier  to  advocate  with  higher  level  municipal  officials.'83  Unfortunately,  the  promotion  and  advocacy  slum  land  tenure  is  beyond  their  jurisdiction,  hence  their  indifference  to  the

political  plight  of  slum  dwellers.  DWASA  is  deprived  of  the  revenue  and  illegal  operators  make  large  profits.   This  power  is  also  used  to  control  and  manipulate  power  in  the  social  structure  slums.   Parties  involved  in  this  illegal  market  are  a  formidable  source  of  resistance  to  the  project  (Matin,  1999).  More  management  by  communities  can  result,  but  alliances  and  monitoring  will  have  to  be  ongoing  by  communities  (Khandekar,  2008).   Meters  on  WPs  exist  and  bills  are  sent  out  every  two  months.   While  there  is  some  corruption  and  concerns  with  DWASA  meter  readers,  community  monitoring  and  meter  reading  has  been  encouraged  (Akash  and  Singha,  2011).  Clearly,  bill  collections  have  improved  as  in  2008,  forty  percent  of  NRW  while  in  2013,  twenty  seven  percent  of  NRW.  According  to  DWASA  officers,  `Revenue  collection  has  also  improved  from  2008,  sixty  four  percent  to  2013,  ninety  nine  percent.  Bills  sent have remained steady, ninety three percent in 2008 to ninety nine percent in 2013.'84 

4.3.3

Intergovernmental support and policy failures

Primary and secondary research reveals a number of intergovernmental constraints to lower tier service  delivery  to  the  informal  sector.  These  constraints  appear  across  institutions  and  policies.  Among  the  institutional  constraints  is  the  lack  of  inter  departmental  recognition  for  mandates.  For  example,  DWASA's  board  is  not  engaged  by  the  upper  tier  RAJUK  or  municipal  electrical  authority  (DESA)  despite  contract  management  and  billing  concerns  with  both  departments.  An  elite  group  of  wealthy  constituents  are  represented  on  DWASA's  board  and  routinely  neglect  the  concerns  of  lower  income  ward  commissioners.  According  to  DWASA  financial  officers,  `DWASA  is  barely  breaking  even.'85  Senior  WASA officials have complained that `our internal reform efforts are succeeding, political interference is  still  a  problem  in  areas  such  as  contract  award  and  quality  of  service  delivery.'86  The  labour  relations  environment is also challenging with unions often aligned with political parties, and threatening to strike  to  ensure  the  preservation  of  benefits,  remuneration  and  avoidance  of  reforms.  A  weak  institutional  context  has  seen  various  DWASA  assets  fall  into  disrepair  and  serve  as  sites  for  criminal  activities.  A  number  of  landlords  are  linked  with  upper  tier  state  actors  and  stall  land  reforms  which  would  benefit

slum  dwellers.  The  policy  constraints  can  be  summarized  by  a  lack  of  upper  tier  resources  for  lower  tier  implementation.  For  example,  a  number  of  policies  had  been  initiated  since  1991  to  address  water  use  for  various  urban  uses  (Ministry  of  Local  Government,  2012;  WaterAid,  2010)  (See  Appendix).  A  culture  of  `policy  formalism'  is  observed,  where  existing  policies  have  not  been  followed  by  transparent  implementation  (Akash  and  Singh,  1999).  Policies  such  as  the  Bangladesh  Flood  Action  Plan  (FAP)  have  short changed the meaning of participation, by engaging bureaucrats and higher tier policy makers while  excluding  citizens  (Hanchett,  S.,  1997;  Woop,  1999).  There  have  not  been  any  linkages  with  other  poverty  reduction  strategies,  in  spite  of  DWASAs  value  in  providing  water.  In  light  of  disabling  intergovernmental factors, DWASA's operations fare poorly when compared with other utilities.  Interview  results  and  secondary  evidence  outline  the  isolated  position  of  the  lower  tier  DWASA  and  recent  reform  efforts.  A  reputable  NGO  representative  pointed  out  sarcastically  `We  have  established  good  relations  with  DWASA  staff,  but  DCC  staff  is  somewhat  aloof  as  they  are  not  set  up  to  deal  with  individuals.'87  DWASA  management  recognizes  the  need  to  develop  capacity  and  capability  in  order  to  engage  upper  tier  bureaucrats  (DWASA,  2014).  After  much  lobbying,  DWASA  has  been  able  to  `independently'  engage  NGOs  and  donors  in  outreach  and  capacity  building  programs  (DWASA,  2012).  According  to  DWASA,  `as  we  are  unable  to  engage  informal  settlements,  we  rely  on  MOUs  with  NGOs  and  CBOs  to  set  up  water  points  and  address  the  illegal  connections  that  are  pilfering  water  from  our  bottom  line.'88  Through  NGO  facilitation,  management  meetings  are  also  held  in  low  income  areas  (DWASA,  2012).  In  light  of  climate  change  and  severe  wet  weather  events,  there  is  an  urgent  for  coordination  between  upper  and  lower  tier  actors  89  (Wateraid,  2007).  Intergovernmental  support  for  DWASA  is  minimal,  as  per  the  research  and  commentary  from  the  staff  and  interview  subjects.  Overall,  the  real  engagements  that  will  assist  DWASA  are  through  other  lower  tier  nonstate  actors.  In

Only 6 million can be supported by DCC, where the population  now stands at 16 million. In Dhaka there are over 5,000 bastis and forty percent are in precarious conditions. There has been an accelerated  rate of disasters from 1960s to1970s to 1980s and climate refugees are increasingly being pushed into policy discussions. Internal migration on  the rise and local adaptation where cities are recipients needs to be developed. Commentators point to the poor as likely to suffer from such  disasters the most. Alternatives include community engagement from the bottom up.  Additional measures are rehabilitation of settlements,  mixed agriculture replacing monoculture, resource comanagement, multi stakeholder governance, and transparency and accountability  frameworks.

partnership  with  lower  tier  CBOs,  there  are  higher  observed  returns  on  program  sustainment,  in  so  far  as the expert interviews have revealed. 

4.3.4

Citizen engagement or pro-poor engagement

Policy  and  program  research  reveals  differences  between  citizen  and  targeted  programs  offered  by  upper  and  lower  tiers  of  the  state.  For  instance,  although  a  number  of  national  level  policies  that  claim  to  improve  access  to  basic  services  (such  as  water  and  sanitation,  housing  and  shelter  and  solid  waste  collection)  to  the  informal  sector  and  urban  poor,  there  is  little  evidence  of  on  the  ground  implementation  (BCAS,  2012).  A  number  of  policies  specific  to  slum  upgrading  and  engaging  the  poor  are  either  time  bound  projects  or  depend  on  external  funds  for  implementation.  For  example,  a  foreign  donor  may  take  interest  in  providing  a  service  to  a  group  of  `hard  core  poor'  settlements.  However,  the  funding  for  such  projects  lasts  a  few  years  with  much  consumed  by  overhead,  graft  and  mismanagement.  In  any  event,  once  the  project  ends,  the  context  returns  to  pre  support  levels  with  little hope for improvement.  At  the  lower  tiers,  interviews  and  reports  reveal  a  shift  in  approach  by  DWASA,  where  officials  have  launched  programs  to  extend  services  to  all  users  including  the  informal  sector  (DSK,  2012;  DWASA,  2012). DWASA's management team has expressed concern in the increasing polarization between those  who  can  pay  for  the  commodity  and  those  who  cannot  afford  the  infrastructure  investment  for  the  initial  service  connection.  Furthermore,  the  linkage  between  unaccounted  for  water  and  poor  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements  is  being  recognized  by  state  and  nonstate  actors  (DSK,  2014;  DWASA,  2014;  Wateraid,  2010).  While  ninety  eight  percent  to  one  hundred  percent  of  higher  income  neighbourhoods receive services, fifty to seventy five percent of lower income communities have access  to  services  (Jahan  and  Kalam,  1996).    In  slums  and  squatter  settlements,  there  is  only  two  percent  coverage.    Slum  dwellers  recognize  the  role  of  DCC  and  DWASA  and  have  experienced  mixed  outcomes  when  lobbying for the establishment of service connections. In the past, their efforts have failed as there is no  policy document that engages slum dwellers directly in Dhaka. As a result, DWASA expressed no interest  in  extending  services  to  a  community  without  the  consent  and  authorization  of  the  landlord.  However,  through  persistent  NGO  facilitation,  some  informal  settlements  have  made  progress  in  engaging  frontline  officers,  if  not  senior  managers.  This  is  similar  to  the  situation  in  housing  and  shelter  as  well  117   

where NGO actors comment `We have  good relations with the local slum development officer, but  have  a  hard  time  engaging  higher  level  state  actors.'90  Other  NGO  actors  in  solid  waste  have  claimed  that  while  the  city  benefits  from  the  service  provided  by  the  informal  sector,  there  is  little  if  any  recognition  or support is given to informal settlements and slum dwellers (WC, 2013).   Most  recently,  a  citizen  charter  was  developed  to  govern  expectations  between  DWASA  and  its  customers.  Although  a  complaint  centre,  capital  project  plan  and  a  quasilegal  provision  of  piped  water  supply to the urban slum dweller was developed, a lawful act in black and white was found to be missing  (Wateraid, 2010).  Workshops by Wateraid revealed that CBOs that engage slum dwellers on the ground  are  better  served  by  frontline  support  and  coordination  with  state  staff  (Wateraid,  2014).  In  response,  DWASA  established  a  `Low  Income  Wing'  specifically  mandated  to  engage  NGOs  as  well  as  well  as  CBOs  of  slum  dwellers  and  formalize  agreements  for  establishing  water  service  lines.  This  administrative  approach  to  engaging  the  poor  has  been  enabled  by  the  autonomy  of  utility  decision  making  coupled  with  the  social  and  economic  pressure  to  expand  the  customer  base.  Regardless,  it  illustrates  the  value  of citizen engagement at the lower tiers to extend services to the informal sector. 

4.3.5

Donor/Civil society activity

Primary  and  secondary  evidence  reveals  significant  donor  and  civil  society  activity  in  the  water  and  sanitation  sector.  While  a  number  of  donors  and  civil  society  actors  advocate  for  policy  reforms  and  project  delivery  at  the  upper  tiers  of  the  state,  their  impact  is  limited.  A  prominent  NGO  researcher  lamented  `We  have  proposed  site  specific  solutions  to  the  deep  pockets  of  large  multilaterals.  Their  response  has  been  to  scale  up  prematurely  and  give  lucrative,  capital  intensive  contracts  out  to  private  sector  consultants.  When  projects  fail,  then  we  are  called  in  to  clean  up  the  mess  and  salvage  deliverables.'91 There are those that manage specific projects and influence service delivery outcomes at  the  neighbourhood  levels  of  large  cities.  These  nonstate  actors  possess  both  the  policy  knowledge  and  technical  expertise  within  the  water  and  sanitation  service  delivery  context.  They  are  also  socially

engaged  with  low  income  communities  and  informal  settlements  (slums)  that  are  in  most  need  of  basic  services.  This  in  depth  knowledge  of  policies,  programs  and  stakeholders  makes  these  nonstate  actors  invaluable  to  service  delivery  in  large  complex  mega  cities.  Let  us  now  turn  to  a  few  examples  that  illustrate the activity of donors and civil society actors in Dhaka.  One of the most prominent indigenous NGOs in Dhaka's water and sanitation sector is Dhushta Shastrya  Kendra  (DSK).  Initiated  by  a  group  of  health  professionals  in  1994,  they  aimed  to  educate  slum  dwellers  on  the  benefits  of  clean  drinking  water  and  hygienic  practices.  Numerous  sanitation  projects  evolved  from  hygiene  training  and  replaced  `hanging'  or  `suspended  latrines'  with  toilet  blocks  and  where  necessary  accessibility  based  design  (Matin,  1999).    Over  time,  they  realized  that  their  success  was  limited  by  the  absence  of  piped  water  into  slum  dweller  communities.  The  NGO  approached  DWASA  with  a  community  based  water  point  model  of  service  delivery.  This  model  involves  DSK  guaranteeing  that  a  CBO  would  gather  and  repay  the  utility  for  supporting  a  metered  connection  (DSK  inventory  on  slums, 2012; Matin, N., 1999; Wateraid, 2012). A technical donor, Wateraid, funds DSK's operating costs.  After a few successful pilots, DWASA permitted DSK to mobilize slum dweller CBOs in the Adabor district  of  Dhaka.  During  a  3  month  period,  130  water  points  were  installed  (DSK,  2009)  along  with  over  400  other  water  and  sanitation  assets  (Hachett  et  al,  2003).   DSK  has  also  elevated  its  role  as  an  advocate  in  policy  discussions,  by  serving  as  secretary  of  Bangladesh's  `Water  Supply  Sanitation  Collaborative  Council',  a  forum  for  state  and  nonstate  actors  to  improve  service  delivery  to  the  poor  (WSSCCB,  2011).  DSK's  support  of  the  informal  sector  has  grown  to  other  cities  resulting  in  a  total  of  1  million  beneficiaries  (DSK  Annual  Report,  2010).  Other  donors  involved  in  supporting  such  on  the  ground  services  in  Dhaka  include  Plan  Bangladesh  and  Concern  International  (Housing  and  Shelter).  The  successful  extension  of  service  delivery  to  the  informal  sector  is  linked  to  the  clearly  defined  roles  and  responsibilities of state and nonstate actors (WB, 2007).  Interview  information  with  state  and  nonstate  actors  reveals  a  complementary  relationship  between  technical  nonstate  providers  and  administrative  state  actors.  DSK  researchers  emphasize  the  complementary  relationship  `we  need  institutions,  DCC  and  DWASA  to  work  in  balance  with  donors  and 

119   

civil  society  actors.   Only  then  will  service  delivery  extension  be  possible.'92  In  the  case  of  the  MOU  with  DSK,  the  NGO  assesses  the  situation,  facilitates  community  engagement,  identifies  problems,  prioritizes  issues, mobilizes the  community, establishes the CBO, selects options and design, develops location and  formulates  guidelines  on  water  usage  and  cost  sharing  (DSK,  2012).   DSK  also  mediates  with  the  utilities  and  lends  capital  costs  to  communities  for  both  water  and  sanitation  projects  (Singha,  2012).  The  mobilization  of  CBOs  has  resulted  in  the  piloting  of  rain  water  harvesting,  school  hygiene  programs,  public  and  eco  toilets  in  urban  settings  (DSK,  2012).  Through  such  program  support,  DSK  staff  has  been  able  to  point  out  gaps  in  DCC  and  DWASA  processes.  Namely,  the  resolution  of  billing  and  water  shortages  could  be  resolved  through  routine  engagement  with  CBOs  and  bill  preparation.  DSK  and  CBO  staff  has  found  that  DCC  officials  and  other  state  actors  only  care  to  visit  slums  during  election  time  (WSP,  2009).  This  observation  on  political  neglect  is  supported  by  other  NGOs  involved  in  housing  and  shelter,  which  complain  `we  are  doing  the  work  of  DCC  and  only  require  their  official  support  to  replicate the model. Unfortunately, they fail to respond to our calls for increased participation.'93  In  its  engagement  with  lower  tier  NGOs  and  CBOs,  DWASA  maintains  responsibility  for  the  larger  water  and  sanitation  system  infrastructure.  DWASA  provides  technical  input,  permits  for  construction  and  approvals  for  the  connection  of  the  water  points  (ADB,  2011).  The  utility  also  takes  part  in  donor  loans  for  infrastructure  renewal  that  are  largely  negotiated  by  upper  tiers  of  the  state.  DWASA  management  have pointed to their autonomy as enabling  them to ensure  that  any financial  or technical support from  the  upper  tiers  of  the  state,  are  fully  engaged  in  and  absorbed  through  relevant  utility  departments  (DWASA,  2014).  Having  demonstrated  a  commitment  to  reform,  institutional  engagement  with  the  ADB  has  led  to  the  funding  of  a  model  of  revenue  recovery  (DWASA,  2007).  Through  its  engagement  with  DSK  and  other  NGOs,  DWASA  has  grown  more  familiar  with  engaging  slum  dwellers  as  customers  (DSK,  2010).  This  trend  has  also  enabled  DWASA  to  take  a  stand  in  servicing  the  informal  sector,  when  other  stakeholders (high income communities, developers, land owners) exhibit resistance. Studies by DSK and

partners  have  shown  that  increased  employment  opportunities  and  productivity  resulted  from  such  empowerment efforts which contribute to local economic activity (DSKSHIREE, 2011).  The results of engagement between DWASA and DSK have been undoubtedly fruitful (BUET, 2008).  DSK  leadership was quoted `Our internal studies have found that one hundred percent of DWASA's bills were  paid  by  slum  dwellers  as  opposed  to  eighty  percent  from  other  customers.  On  the  other  hand,  the  recovery  of  the  financial  costs  by  DSK  for  establishing  water  points  was  only  forty  one  percent.'94  In  other  words,  slum  dwellers  are  able  to  pay  their  water  bills,  but  are  often  unable  to  pool  together  sufficient  resources  to  repay  the  NGO  for  establishing  the  community  water  point.  According  to  DSK,  this  illustrates  the  financial  burden  on  slum  communities  and  the  constant  pressure  of  evictions  (DSK,  2012).  In  operational  terms,  the  price  of  water  has  decreased  for  slum  dwellers  with  positive  outcomes  for community health. The results of positive social and financial outcomes for communities and DWASA  infrastructure  across  Mirpur,  has  drawn  positive  attention  from  state  actors  across  Dhaka.  As  a  result,  DSK has been approved by the DCC to replicate the water point model to slums in other districts outside  of  Mirpur  (DSK,  2012).  Wateraid  continues  to  actively  support  DSK  and  other  NGOs  in  Dhaka,  which  are  leading public health reform and DCC engagement of the urban poor (Hanchett et al, 2003).   Donor  and  civil  society  activity  has  been  intense  and  more  institutionalized  in  the  water  and  sanitation  sector  in  recent  years.  The  focused  cooperation  of  lower  tier  state  and  nonstate  actors  is  common  across  to  other  service  delivery  contexts.    In  housing  and  shelter,  the  Amrao  Manush  consortium  of  NGOs  engages  the  slum  wing  of  the  DCC  to  provide  shelter  for  pavement  dwellers.  Nevertheless,  a  lack  of  coordination  persists  across  many  sectors  for  while  government  agencies  work  with  NGOs  and  CBOs  in one way, their engagement with donors, UN, INGOs and apex NGOs is also different.  MOUs exist with  the  former  but  the  latter  operate  through  more  sophisticated  terms  of  reference  which  offsets  any  predictable  modes  of  engagement.    A  mechanism  is  required  to  ensure  consistency  and  coordinated  interventions,  including  subsidized  tariffs  for  slum  dwellers,  additional  community  development  programs,  capacity  building,  primary  practices,  performance  management  and  monitoring  (Wateraid,

2010).  According  to  donors  `There  is  potential  for  more  engagement  with  other  academic  and  policy  actors  to  formulate  innovative  solutions.  There  is  also  a  need  to  simply  have  state  actors  (DCC  and  DWASA)  work  to  engage  the  poor  more.'95  The  launch  of  ASEH  (advanced  sanitation  and  environmental  health)  combines  public  health  education  with  sanitation  measures  to  improve  health.    A  national  program  would  tie  it  together  with  the  interests  of  all  state  departments  in  water,  sanitation  and  public  health; in a transparent manner which then results in measurable outputs (Wateraid, 2012). 

4.4 Case Studies
I  now  turn  to  two  case  studies  which  illustrate  the  dynamics  between  upper  and  lower  tier  state  actors  as part of efforts to extend service delivery to informal settlements. I have structured the content of the  case  studies  to  highlight  the  specific  comparator  variables  that  have  influenced  service  delivery  to  informal settlements. 

4.4.1

The Case of Kalyanpura Basti: A Successful Outcome

Since  1992,  DWASA  has  been  extending  water  supply  services  to  Dhaka's  slums  through  the  facilitation  of  local  NGOs  such  as  DSK.  In  2007,  DWASA's  first  transfer  of  water  point  ownership  took  place  when  a  DSK guaranteed account was transferred to the ownership of the CBO for Kalyanpura Basti.  The positive  outcomes  that  resulted  from  the  Kalyanpura  Basti  experience  prompted  DWASA  to  change  its  bylaws  and  create  a  special  provision  for  service  connections  from  city  mains  to  slum  communities  under  the  oversight of a facilitating NGOs name.   

4.4.1.1 Background
Kalyanpura  Basti  was  established  in  1988  on  6  acres  of  government  land  in  Dhaka's  northern  district  of  Mirpur.  In  2003,  2,476  families  lived  in  the  slum.  As  of  2013,  8,455  slum  dwellers  have  made  this  `basti'  (informal settlement) their home. DSK has ranked the extension of service delivery to this basti as one of  the  most  positive  outcomes  in  its  history.  This  is  in  part  due  to  the  fact  that  over  the  last  10  years,  the  slum  has  been  evicted  on  three  separate  occasions  (2003,  2007  and  2010).  The  basti's  residents  are  an

example  of  how  environmental  refugees  are  absorbed  by  informal  settlements.  Most  of  the  families  have  migrated  to  the  basti  from  coastal  districts  that  have  suffered  from  river  erosion  or  evicted  slum  areas. Many of them were artesian fisher folk who lost their livelihoods as persistent flooding inundated  their  fish  farms.  All  of  the  slum's  families  are  categorized  as  either  poor  or  extremely  poor.   The  major  occupations  of  slum  dwellers  are  day  laborer,  rickshaw  puller,  drivers,  street  vendor,  garments  workers,  fruit and vegetable vendors, small business owners and a range of odd service jobs. The average income  of slum households ranges between BDT 4,000 to 10,000 per month (USD $50 to $125).   In  the  early  years,  all  of  the  basti's  households  lacked  access  to  basic  services.    Most  of  the  residents  were  illiterate  and  lacked  a  basic  knowledge  of  health  and  hygiene  issues.    The  scarcity  of  water  resources  and  sanitation  facilities  led  to  the  proliferation  of  disease.  During  this  time  one  hundred  percent  of  the  basti's  residents  used  the  unhygienic  hanging  toilet,  and  one  hundred  percent  of  the  population  had  to  collect  drinking  water  from  a  long  distance  (1,500  to  1,800  feet  away)  or  at  a  high  price  (20  times  higher  than  the  utility  tariff)  from  an  illegal  water  vendor.  One  hundred  percent  of  the  population  also  used  contaminated  and  stagnant  ditch  water  for  washing,  bathing  and  other  household  purposes96.  Despite  community  efforts  to  engage  local  officials,  service  delivery  was  not  extended.  The  slum continued to suffer from the absence of drainage, roads, schools and other state services. 

4.4.1.2 Intervention
Shortly  after  the  establishment  of  the  slum  in  1988,  a  foreign  funded  group  (Phulki)  made  a  number  of  interventions  with  lower  tier  state  actors  and  the  community  that  resulted  in  construction  of  a  water  point, several latrines, tube wells and hygiene awareness. In 1990, DSK took over the effort as Phulki ran  out of resources.  DSK  then mobilized the basti's community  through social  mapping, wellbeing ranking,  problem  identification  and  action  plans  for  slum  improvement.  As  a  result  of  engagement  by  nonstate  actors  and  community  based  design,  72  water  points  (for  1,630  households)  were  connected  through  a  930  foot  distribution  line  to  a  DWASA  water  main.  In  addition  to  establishing  increased  service  through

 Need to cost a model out that makes the public utility service feasible for engagement, as compared to merely relying on illegal means.

the  lower  tier  state  utility,  DSK  continued  to  educate  slum  dwellers  on  the  benefits  of  hygiene.  As  a  result,  sanitation  coverage  was  increased  to  ninety  percent  of  the  basti.    This  was  facilitated  by  the  construction  of  51  clusters  of  sanitary  latrines  and  a  connection  to  the  public  sewage  line.  A  CBO  was  formed to manage the water points and sewage disposal.   A  pattern  of  evictions  soon  began  which  tested  the  basti's  resilience.  In  December,  2003,  residents  of  the  slum  were  evicted  by  developer  plans  that  engaged  upper  tier  state  actors.   During  this  eviction,  a  total  of  2,476  families  were  uprooted.  Despite  protests  from  the  community  and  the  existence  of  lower  tier  state  infrastructure,  demolition  continued.    All  community  developed  infrastructure  was  subsequently  demolished,  including  the  distribution  line,  set  up  by  the  lower  tier  DWASA.  However,  formal  development  never  began.  In  early  2004,  a  few  months  after  the  eviction,  slum  reconstruction  activities  started  and  families  began  moving  back.  The  major  interventions  of  water  supply,  sanitation  facilities,  hygiene  promotion  and  capacity  building  of  the  CBO  continued.  However,  due  to  the  distance  of  the  DWASA  main,  DSK  could  not  facilitate  the  reconnection  of  water  supply  to  the  slum.  During  that  time  community  efforts  around  construction  of  latrines,  improvement  of  drainage  facilities,  solid  waste  management, and hygiene promotion continued.   In  2006,  a  focused  action  research  project  was  launched  by  DSK  to  ensure  the  effective  participation  of  the  socially  and  economically  disadvantaged  urban  poor  in  local  institutions  and  decision  making  processes.  The  `ASEH  Project'  mobilized  the  community  to  establish  10  cluster  latrines,  12  water  points,  a  mobile  water  van  and  over  1,400  feet  of  storm  water  drains.  Training  in  health  and  hygiene  has  also  continued  with  a  focus  on  hand  washing,  safe  water  and  hygienic  practices.  Capacity  building  through  ASEH  not  only  solidified  community  cohesion  but  it  also  extended  the  basti's  networks  beyond  DSK  to  include  three  other  slum  advocacy  groups  and  legal  advisers.  The  extension  of  the  basti's  community  network would add to its resilience in the coming year.     In  2007,  the  basti's  slum  dwellers  were  evicted  once  again.  Again,  despite  the  presence  of  `development'  plans  sanctioned  by  upper  tier  state  actors,  development  did  not  take  place  and  the  community  returned.  When  DSK  surveyed  the  community,  they  realized  that  the  majority  of  slum  dwellers  were  already  familiar  with  the  necessity  of  hand  washing,  safe  drinking  water,  cleanliness  and  hygienic  latrines.  There  was  no  need  for  the  introduction  of  new  practices,  despite  the  demolition  of  all  constructed  infrastructure.  In  the  absence  of  developer  pressure,  the  community  resumed  negotiations  124   

with DWASA, the state water utility. In 2008 after substantial negotiations with DWASA, DSK arrange for  a  water  supply  network  to  be  extended  closer  to  the  slum.  As  of  June  2010,  DSK  had  facilitated  DWASA  water supply coverage to one hundred percent of the basti. In the past, each family had to pay BDT 200   300  per  month  for  drinking  water.  Now  the  cost  for  water  has  been  reduced  to  BDT  4060  with  more  than triple the quantity of water. Before the establishment of the DWASA connection, slum dwellers had  to  spend  BDT  2  to  5  for  each  20  liters  of  water.  This  is  in  sharp  contrast  to  the  DWASA  price  of  1,000  liters  of  water  for  BDT  7.  The  basti  has  complete  coverage  for  sewage  and  sanitation  facilities.  Special  latrines  have  also  been  installed  for  the  disabled  and  physically  challenged.  Such  innovation  has  led  to  local  CBO  representatives  serving  on  the  national  council  of  slum  dwellers.  DSK  has  noticed  that  where  evictions  take  place,  the  migrant  workers  take  best  practices  with  them  to  the  new  communities  where  they settle.    CBO  engagement  through  WASH  has  also  enabled  them  to  reach  out  to  other  service  providers.  For  instance,  a  number  of  INGO  operated  day  care  centres  and  health  clinics  now  serve  the  slum  dwellers.  The  CBO  has  also  been  able  to  form  a  registered  organization,  the  Urban  Slum  Development  Organization  (Nagar  Bastibasi  Unnayan  Sangstha).  As  an  initiative  of  the  urban  working  organization  (DSK)  and  slum  peoples'  effort,  the  CBO  has  engaged  Dhaka's  ward,  zone  and  city  levels  of  government  to  access  services  from  the  appropriate  authority.  A  bank  account  also  opened  in  the  name  of  the  slum  organization,  where  they  are  reserving  their  savings  for  future  support  such  as  purchasing  their  own  land  on  an  installment  basis.  More  CBO  awareness  of  services  led  to  the  establishment  of  a  water  connection from DWASA.   Case  study  evidence  illustrates  how  lower  tier  state  actors  such  as  DWASA  can  be  engaged  to  provide  services,  in  spite  of  upper  tier  policy  failures  and  developer  pressure.  Furthermore,  the  study  illustrates  how  a  welldeveloped  empowered  CBO  can  facilitate  processes  of  development  planning,  meetings  and  project  implementation  from  the  `bottom  up'.  In  fact,  the  CBO  is  so  well  established  that  the  basti's  community  centre  also  serves  as  the  central  office  of  the  Dhaka  City  Citizen  Action  Committee  (DCCAC).  The  CBO  has  built  its  capacity  in  advocacy  and  diligently  lobbies  with  service  providers  to  obtain  access  to  services.   The  key  features  of  this  experience  are  the  resilience  of  the  slum  dwellers  and  community  despite  repeated  evictions.    Their  ability  to  reorganize  and  demand  their  rights  following  consecutive  evictions is the key driver for service delivery access. 

125   

4.4.1.3 NextSteps
Now  that  a  resilient  CBO  has  been  empowered  to  manage  the  project,  community  participation  has  increased.  Needs  based  DSK  training  sessions  have  been  provided  to  CBO  leadership  to  run  the  organization,  maintain  facilities  and  sustain  relations  with  DWASA.  Negotiations  have  also  begun  with  other  service  providers.  A  community  managed  solid  waste  disposal  system  is  now  in  operation.  Human  development indicators among women and children have improved as water and sanitation facilities are  closer  and  affordable.  The  threat  of  eviction  remains  for  Kalyanpura  Basti,  but  DSK  as  well  as  the  CBO  are  confident  that  regardless  of  the  outcome  of  land  development,  best  practices  of  development  and  mobilization to engage DWASA and other lower tier authorities will continue as needed. DSK has noticed  that  when  resettlement  takes  place,  communities  take  best  practices  and  learning  of  engaging  government with them to the next slum that they occupy. 

4.4.2

The Case of Korail Basti: An Unsuccessful Outcome

Since  the  mid1980s,  DSK  has  been  empowering  slum  dwellers  to  participate  in  development  initiatives  through  problem  identification,  planning,  implementation  and  monitoring.   DSK  has  been  managing  and  monitoring  water,  sanitation  and  hygiene  interventions  in  Korail  since  the  launch  of  the  WASH  (Water,  Sanitation  and  Hygiene)  program  in  the  early  1990s.  DSK  has  been  implementing  water  and  sanitation  projects  in  Dhaka's  slums  since  1992.   The  ongoing  capacity  building  of  Korail  Basti's  CBO  has  led  to  the  development  of  community  master  plans  to  coordinate  the  efforts  of  state  and  nonstate  actors  in  developing the slum. Unfortunately, due to a number of constraints from upper tier state actors, service  delivery extension efforts have stalled.   

4.4.2.1 Background
Korail  Basti  is  one  of  the  largest  and  highly  populated  slums  in  Dhaka,  located  near  the  city  centre.  The  slum  formed  in  1974  on  90  acres  of  public  land  as  migrant  laborers  from  the  rural  north  arrived  looking  for  employment  opportunities  in  the  growing  mega  city.  In  2010,  it  was  home  to  over  20,000  families  accounting  for  over  100,000  people.  The  slum  is  situated  within  the  higher  income  Gulshan,  Banani  and  Mohakhali  residential  areas,  along  the  west  bank  of  Gulshan  Lake.  Despite  its  high  population  density  and  support  from  DSK,  the  local  CBO  has  been  unable  to  secure  water  and  sanitation  connections  through DWASA.    

126   

The  basti's  size  and  diversity  of  livelihoods  highlights  the  economic  contribution  of  informal  sector  workers  to  the  mega  city's  resilience.  The  major  occupations  of  slum  dwellers  are  segregated  along  gender  lines.  The  occupations  of  the  male  residents  is  divided  into  rickshaw  pullers  (forty  percent),  day  labourers (twenty three percent), small vendors, auto and push cart drivers, street vendors, beggars, rag  pickers  and  seasonal  workers.  The  occupation  of  female  residents  can  be  divided  into  garment  workers  (sixty  five  percent),  maid  servants,  rag  pickers,  street  vendors  and  day  laborers.  The  Average  household  monthly  income  is  BDT  3,000  which  is  varies  from  BDT  1,500  to  10,000.    The  major  household  expenditures  include  food,  rent  (BDT  1,2002,000  per  month),  water  (BDT  120150  per  month),  fuel  wood  (BDT  200  400  per  month),  electricity  (BDT  100300  per  month),  medication  and  other  incidental  expenses.   A  bazaar  with  over  200  shops  is  located  in  the  heart  of  the  slum  with  over  800  other  shops  spread  throughout  the  basti.  Over  22  NGOs  and  INGOs  operate  in  the  basti  and  provide  support  to  18  informal  schools,  3  health  clinics,  5  masjids,  6  madrassahs,  2  markets  and  2  registered  clubs.   There  are  also  a  range  of  child  care,  microcredit  for  sustainable  livelihoods,  empowerment  activities  and  awarenessraising  services.   As  such,  the  slum  serves  as  a  `research  hub'  for  national  (Dhaka  University)  and international universities (BRAC), institutes and NGOs.   Korail  is  challenged  by  poor  infrastructure  which  results  in  dilapidated  households  with  poor  living  conditions.  Poor  infrastructure  that  constitutes  dilapidated  lake  front  slums,  inadequate  drainage,  deteriorating  foot  paths,  narrow  lanes  and  illegal  water  connections  has  led  to  the  spread  of  unhygienic  open  latrines,  a  lack  of  gas  supply  (for  cooking),  low  household  incomes,  low  caloric  intake  (less  than  three  meals  a  day),  insufficient  medical  care  and  insufficient  education  infrastructure.  Unresolved  disputes and poor documentation regarding land ownership by upper tier state actors has also led to the  ongoing threat of evictions.   Water  and  sanitation  facilities  across  the  slum  are  in  very  poor  in  condition.  There  are  only  3  official  supply  connections  that  have  been  connected  to  DWASA's  nearest  water  main.  However,  there  are  22  unofficial  water  supply  lines  which  have  been  illegally  connected  by  organized  crime  gangs  to  the  same  DWASA main.  The illegal supply of water to slum dwellers is being distributed through 1,295 household  connections  at  a  cost  which  is  15  to  16  times  higher  than  the  DWASA  rate.   Each  household  pays  in  the  range  of  BDT  100   200  per  month  for  an  intermittent,  contaminated  supply.   The  illegal  water  lines  are  run  across  the  lake  and  are  composed  of  rubber  hoses  which  are  taped  together,  end  to  end.    As  a  result,  the  flow  of  water  from  `good  quality'  DWASA  main  lines,  becomes  contaminated  once  it  is  piped  127   

through  the  contaminated  lake  water.  Most  of  Korail's  sanitation  facilities  are  in  very  poor  condition.   Over  1,000  toilets  are  in  use,  but  over  seventy  percent  of  them  are  unhygienic.    Many  of  them  are  connected  to  the  lake  water,  which  in  turn  contaminates  the  illegally  piped  water  which  supplies  the  slum.   

4.4.2.2 Intervention
NGO  engagement  of  the  slum  community  started  with  education  and  advocacy.  In  2000,  DSK  began  work  in  Korail  in  areas  of  public  health  and  hygiene  promotion.   After  the  initial  assessment,  DSK  learnt  that  the  root  cause  of  poor  health  was  the  ad  hoc  and  insufficient  approach  to  sanitation.   DSK  capacity  building  workshops  contributed  to  the  strengthening  of  the  slums'  CBO,  which  contributed  to  slum  community  mobilization  beyond  the  project  period97.  In  2002,  DSK  began  implementing  a  water  and  sanitation  project  that  targeted  5,000  households.  As  a  result  of  DSKCBO  collaboration,  88  community  latrines,  376  single/twin  pit  latrines,  a  drainage  system  and  5  bathing  stalls  were  installed  to  serve  over  3,000  families.  The  application  for  a  water  connection  through  DWASA  was  denied,  due  to  intergovernmental tensions regarding departmental ownership.   Over the next several years, education  and crisis  management further solidified the bond between NGO  and  CBO.  In  2003,  DSK  broadened  its  water  and  sanitation  program  with  support  from  The  British  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  International  Development  (DFID)  and  Water  Aid  Bangladesh.  The  focus  was  on  community  empowerment  and  asset  development  for  water  and  sanitation  to  reduce  the  prevalence  and  threat  of  diseases.  In  2004,  DSK  implemented  the  WASH  intervention  in  one  part  of  Korail,  targeting  5,000  households.    Later  on  in  2004,  a  devastating  fire  gutted  over  4,000  thousand  homes,  incinerating  most  of  the  homes  and  their  contents.   When  DSK  provided  emergency  water  and  sanitation  facilities  to  the  affected  families,  it  provided  the  first  trust  building  event  between  DSK  and  the  Korail  community,  which  led  to  deeper  engagement  and  planning.  First,  a  CBO  was  established  with  a  mandate  to  improve  coordination  between  NGOs,  state  actors  and  donors.  It  became  clear  that  a

 The CBO leadership has responded to the poor quality of service extension by the DCC in waste management and in response, has organized  general strikes for the slum dwellers, so as to draw a response from the city.  This effort was successful and when local labour demanded that  services be extended to them, the city responded. 

128   

`Master  Plan'  was  required  for  Korail.  Over  200  community  leaders  from  across  the  basti  participated  in  its  drafting.  When  the  plan  was  taken  to  lower  tier  state  actors,  the  DCC  and  DWASA,  officials  committed  to  assist  with  plan  development.  During  the  course  of  engagement,  the  CBO  identified  the  major  human  development  problems  as  water  supply,  sanitation  (unhygienic  latrines),  poor  drainage,  constrained mobility (lack of a footpath), poor housing and low income. Solutions outlined in the Master  Plan  included  shelter  and  housing,  livelihoods,  health,  WASH,  education,  infrastructure  development,  capacity development, and lobbynetworkingadvocacy.    In  2004,  DSK  and  the  Korail  CBO  took  steps  to  extend  the  municipal  water  supply  to  Korail's  slum  dwellers.   Unfortunately,  due  to  DWASAs  inability  to  establish  a  connection  to  the  nearest  water  main,  no legal access to the municipal system was obtained. Many DWASA officials visited the slum during this  time,  but  due  to  the  political  economy  of  land  ownership,  no  progress  on  connections  was  made.  This  instance  demonstrates  the  inability  of  lower  tier  state  actors  to  extend  services,  as  a  result  of  mismanagement  at  the  upper  tiers  of  the  state.  In  the  interim,  slum  dwellers  have  become  dependent  on  unofficial  and  unsafe  water  which  incurs  a  high  cost98.   On  average  over  BDT  100  to  200  is  spent  per  household on an intermittent and contaminated supply of water for drinking and cooking.  The cost is as  much  as  10  to  15  times  higher  than  the  DWASA  tariff  for  municipal  water.  In  the  meantime,  the  DCC  developed  drainage  systems  and  a  footpath  to  improve  pedestrian  mobility.  A  number  of  other  footpaths  and  drainage  systems  were  improved  through  NGOCBO  collaboration.  Cash  allowances  for  the  poor  and  savings  and  local  service  providers  were  provided  by  the  NGO  and  CBO  to  ensure  that  targeted  hard  core  poor  households  are  raised  from  poverty.   The  results  have  been  increased  income  generation, improved caloric intake and food intake and improved household food security (DSKSHIREE,  2011).  Persistent  efforts  from  the  CBO  caused  DSK  to  bring  the  community  into  another  project,  which  strives  to  establish  a  water  supply  facility  in  the  slum  through  continued  lobbying  and  advocacy  with

 The illegal and unsafe connections are provided by the local 'water mafia' and their accomplices.  First, a sophisticated network of gangs,  political leaders and administrative officials identify a service gap in the absence of state infrastructure.  Then, through a series of regular  payments and informal arrangements, the closest DWASA line is 'tapped' for an illegal connection and lines of loosely bound piping are run  across the surrounding lake and into various connection points.  These pipes often leak at the joints (which are taped together) and allow storm  and waste water from the lake to contaminate the clean water lines.  Slum dwellers are then charged to access the water which is turned on  two times per day.

DWASA  officials.  During  2004,  cluster  latrines  and  solid  waste  collection  bins  were  provided  for  community managed solid waste collection.   In  early  2008,  Korail's  CBO  submitted  a  formal  application  to  DWASA  headquarters,  requesting  the  provision  of  a  water  supply  connection  to  the  slum.   After  several  months  of  lobbying  by  DSK  and  the  CBO,  of  both  DWASA  zone  managers  and  head  office  officials,  an  agreement  was  reached.  In  mid2009,  DWASA  implemented  a  joint  initiative  with  the  Korail  community  where  the  city  would  supply  piped  while  operations  and  maintenance  would  be  the  responsibility  of  the  community.    Subsequently,  DSK  started  the  mapping  and  surveying  exercise  of  the  slum  community  and  the  household  layout.   Engineering  drawings  were  drafted  to  lay  the  framework  for  a  water  distribution  network  that  would  target  one  hundred  percent  of  Korail's  households.   Meanwhile,  Korail's  CBO  organized  meetings  with  slum  dwellers  and  DWASA  officials.    The  community  agreed  to  maintain  the  system  as  per  DWASA's  operating requirements.  Construction of the water supply network started with a service initiation date  of  December  2010.   Then  construction  was  halted  due  to  pressure  from  higher  income  neighbourhoods  and elected officials. Wealthier communities were concerned that extending DWASA service to the basti  would result in reduced services and pressure. To complicate matters, three different state departments  are  disputing  land  ownership  where  the  basti  is  situated.  Although  the  land  is  government  owned,  the  departments  are  backed  by  powerful,  upper  tier  state  actors  who  have  an  eye  on  rising  land  values.  In  the  meantime,  DWASA  infrastructure  remains  within  the  slum  area,  waiting  to  be  used.  In  other  words,  upper  tier  real  estate  speculation  persists  at  the  expense  of  lower  tier  capital  investment  and  revenue  flows. DWASA is losing additional revenues as illegal connections are supplying and contaminating piped  water  to  the  slums.  Water  is  then  poured  into  holding  tanks,  which  take  up  space,  are  located  next  to  latrines  and  are  exposed  to  contamination.  Costs  are  10  times  higher  than  what  the  public  pay,  which  causes  stress  to  slum  dwellers.  DSK  and  the  CBO  need  land  disagreement  resolved  before  deep  tube  well digging can begin. Illegal gas and illegal electricity connections also abound.   As  of  2011,  DSK's  project  work  has  achieved  focused  results  in  sanitation  and  other  infrastructure.  Over  87  community  latrines  (serving  3,000  families),  430  single  pit  latrines  (serving  675  families),  hygiene  promotion  campaigns  (engaging  4,000  families  of  which  1,670  are extremely  poor)  have  been  launched.  Clusters  of  sanitary  latrines  are  designed  and  managed  by  groups  of  households,  under  the  oversight  of  the  CBO.    Solid  waste  collection  has  also  been  initiated  for  4,000  families  through  the  operation  of  4  waste  collection  vans  and  132  composting  barrels.  In  terms  of  infrastructure,  approximately  18,000  130   

square  feet  of  foot  paths  and  drainage  channels  have  been  developed  under  the  project.  Over  12,000  feet of lane and bylane ways have been constructed by the DCC, NGOs and Community over the period.    In  2013,  under  the  LIC  component  of  an  ADB  funded  project,  DWASA  came  forward  to  meet  the  community  demand  for  a  service  connection.    DWASA  launched  a  project  to  establish  a  water  supply  network  inside  the  slums  with  the  aim  of  providing  access  for  all  slum  households  to  DWASA's  water  supply  system.    DSK  and  the  community  extended  their  support  to  DWASA  for  the  work.  Legal  access  has been agreed upon in return of a CBO managed billing payment system and access to sanitation.  This  case  study  illustrates  how  lower  tier  nonstate  actors  are  able  to  mobilize,  develop  capacity  and  engage lower tier state actors for service delivery and support. The case study also illustrates how upper  tier  actors  indirectly  and  directly  constrain  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements.  First,  upper  tier  actors  fail  to  facilitate  the  resolution  of  land  ownership  claims  which  in  turn,  stalls  development  efforts.  Second,  the  collusion  of  upper  tier  officials  and  criminal  elements  that  permits  the  pilferage  of  DWASA  public  water  supply  undermines  the  selfsufficiency  of  the  lower  tier  utility  and  normalizes  criminal  operations  in  the  informal  settlement.  The  case  of  Korail  Basti  demonstrates  that  upper  tier  constraints  are  not  solely  the  result  of  policy  failures,  but  also  of  elite  interests.  The  ability  of  lower  tier  state  and  nonstate actors to persist in extending  service to informal settlements without any measure of political  representation or intergovernmental support demonstrates the value of advocacy with lower tier actors.   The pre requisite in the case of DWASA of course, is the institutional autonomy frameworks. 

4.4.2.3 NextSteps
DWASA  has  promised  that  it  will  establish  a  water  supply  network  inside  the  Korail  Basti  for  slum  dwellers.    DWASA  officials  have  indicated  that  the  network  layout  will  maximize  the  number  of  legal  connections  to  each  of  the  compounds  (clusters  of  some  10  to  30  houses).  A  community  Water  Point  (WP) will be constructed in each compound (1030 households) as part of a joint initiative between DSK,  Korail  community  and  the  CBO.    Construction  of  the  WP  will  be  performed  by  DSK.    Fund  for  the  construction  of  the  WP  will  also  be  borne  by  DSK  through  a  cost  recovery  system  or  cost  sharing  mechanism,  as  determined  in  discussions  with  the  community.  A  management  community  will  be  formed  by  the  compounds'  users  and  2  care  takers  will  be  selected  to  assume  responsibility  of  the  operations  and  maintenance  duties  of  each  Water  Point.  The  Management  Committee  will  submit  the  application for the WP to DWASA and DSK will facilitate the necessary administrative tasks to obtain the  service connection in the name of the community.  The community can also apply for assistance through  131   

the  community  revolving  fund  for  the  WP.   DWASA  will  bill  the  CBO  on  a  monthly  basis  until  the  CBO  assumes the task of monitoring bill payments on a regularly basis.   The  breakdown  of  responsibilities  will  require  active  engagement  between  the  lower  tier  actors  (NGO,  CBO  and  DWASA).  As  per  the  DSK  WP  models,  the  users  (the  community's  women)  will  select  the  site  and  model  according  to  their  need  and  available  location.  Then  the  plan  drawing  and  design  will  be  modified.  A  procurement  subcommittee  will  be  formed  (CBO  and  DSK)  for  acquiring  the  necessary  materials.   The  DSK  engineer  and  committee  will  oversee  the  quality  of  the  material  and  supervise  the  construction  work  and  selection  of  labourers.  Following  completion  of  work,  the  WP  or  cluster  latrine  will  be  handed  over  to  the  Management  Committee,  who  will  oversee  the  operations  and  maintenance  of  the  system.   DSK  will  train  the  committee  on  the  technical  aspects  of  operations  and  maintenance.  The  main  lane  has  been  constructed  by  DCC,  the  Korail  CBO  and  other  NGOs.   Drainage  facilities  have  also  been  developed  by  DCC  and  NGOs  but  have  witnessed  poor  maintenance.   There  are  also  parts  of  the  slum  that  are  without  a  drainage  system.  The  CBO  and  DSK  have  agreed  to  mobilize  the  community  to maintain the drainage system on a regular basis.  The cluster CBO will take responsibility to look after  the cluster activities.   Due  to  political  and  economic  constraints  (DSK,  2014),  work  on  the  extending  the  distribution  network  to the various compounds in Korail has been halted. This move has also been passively supported by the  surrounding middle income communities, who fear loss of water pressure and service, should a medium  sized  distribution  main  be  used  for  supplying  water  to  a  large  dense  informal  settlement.  They  constraints  to  progress  are  as  follows.  First,  land  ownership  tensions  have  been  ongoing  between  three  separate  government  agencies  backed  by  upper  tier  state  actors.  Second,  there  is  pressure  from  organized  crime  gangs  that  are  benefitting  from  the  resale  of  pilfered  water.  Finally,  the  DWASA  bureaucracy  has  been  unwilling  to  address  either  of  these  challenges  due  to  fear  of  retaliation  from  upper tier state entities.  

4.5 Dhaka's comparator variables and case studies
Primary and secondary evidence from Dhaka reveals a history of marginalized municipal development. A  centralized  upper  tier  of  government  bearing  the  impressions  of  colonial  rule  and  elitism  has  persistently  neglected  the  needs  of  lower  tier  service  delivery  actors.  The  absence  of  political  representation,  intergovernmental  support  and  insufficient  pro  poor  initiatives  points  to  continued  132   

neglect  by  the  state's  ruling  elite  and  elected  officials.  However,  in  country  research  has  revealed  the  prominent  role  of  two  comparator  variables  in  extending  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements.  The  accountable  and  transparent  operations  of  an  autonomous  water  and  sanitation  service  delivery  provider  (DWASA)  have  generated  several  outreach  initiatives  that  target  informal  settlements.  Evidence  points  to  the  prominent  role  played  by  the  current  senior  management  team  and  Director  General,  who  have  initiated  a  people  centred  service  delivery  model.  The  success  of  these  programs  is  constrained  by  the  absence  of  intergovernmental  support  or  more  specifically,  upper  tier  actors  locked  in land ownership disputes and development projects. Civil society and donor activity has countered the  inertia  and  barriers  presented  by  upper  tier  actors  and  elite  interests,  by  facilitating  the  engagement  of  informal  settlements  and  representative  CBOs  with  lower  tier  state  actors  such  as  DWASA.  The  persistent  lobbying,  knowledge  sharing  and  relationship  building  with  DWASA  officers  by  community  based actors (DSK and the CBOs) has led to efforts at supplying water and facilitating sanitation services.   The  influence  of  these  two  comparator  variables  is  also  illustrated  in  the  case  studies.  Outcomes  from  Korail  Basti  and  Kalyanpura  basti  reveal  the  beneficial  role  of  an  accountable  and  transparently  run  lower  tier  state  actor  (DWASA)  and  its  cooperation  with  service  delivery  facilitating  NGOs  (DSK)  in  engaging  socially  mobilized  CBOs.  In  Korail,  intergovernmental  tensions  as  well  as  disabling  class  tensions  from  surrounding  higher  income  communities,  stalled  efforts  at  extending  service  delivery.  Calls  to  remove  barriers  to  service  extension,  by  engaging  elected  officials  and  obtaining  support  from  upper  tier  state  actors  were  ignored.  Nevertheless,  pressure  by  the  NGO  mobilized  CBO  continues  to  push for progress and reinvigorate service delivery line construction and extension. It can also be argued  that  the  attention  drawn  to  Korail  Basti's  water  and  sanitation  woes  has  also  illuminated  the  political  economy  of  illegal  service  delivery  in  surrounding  area  and  pilferage  of  the  public  water  lines.  In  Kalyanpur  Pura  basti,  a  lack  of  intergovernmental  support  has  led  to  market  based  developers  and  provincial planning authorities forcing the eviction of the community on several occasions. Nevertheless,  a  mobilized  and  more  resilient  CBO  has  emerged,  returning  to  the  site  and  rebuilding  infrastructure  and  service delivery to sanitation lines.   Findings  from  Dhaka  reveal  the  relationship  between  service  delivery  extension  and  accountable  and  transparent lower tier state actors and mobilized civil society actors engaged with informal settlements.

5 Research Findings Â­ Karachi
The  second  of  my  three  results  chapters  details  findings  from  Pakistan's  mega  city,  Karachi.   I  begin  the  chapter  with  an  overview  of  Pakistan's  national  policy  context  and  recent  calls  for  `municipal  governance'  reforms.  The  chapter  continues  with  an  overview  of  administrative  change  from  the  Mughal period to colonial rule and postindependence. Following this overview, I summarize the current  condition  of  key  service  delivery  institutions  across  Karachi.  I  then  summarize  the  findings  from  the  water  and  sanitation  service  delivery  context  grouped  by  comparator  variable.  The  influence  of  comparator variables on service delivery is then highlighted through the exploration of two case studies.   The  experience  of  two  informal  settlements  with  service  delivery  is  examined  with  emphasis  placed  on  the  role  of  different  comparator  variables.  Let  us  now  turn  to  the  salient  points  of  the  national  context  within which Karachi has grown.   

5.1 Country and Municipal Overview
Since  its  independence  in  1947,  Pakistan  has  undergone  a  rapid  process  of  urbanisation.  The  urban  population,  as  a  proportion  of  the  country's  total  population,  increased  from  14.2  percent  in  1941  to  32.5 percent in 1998 (Hasan & Mohib, 2003). Pakistan's urban population is expected to grow from 37.9  million in 2000 to 56.7 million in 2025.  This increase of fifty percent will present challenges in housing as  well  as  low  income  area  engagement  (SDPD  UNDP,  2010).   The  country's  challenges  with  urban  growth  are  reflected  in  Karachi's  growing  pains.  The  earliest  estimates  of  Karachi's  population  place  it  at  436,000 inhabitants (Hasan & Mohib, 2003). By 1975, the population had grown to 4.0 million. This grew  to 12.1 million in 2007 and is forecasted to balloon to 19.1 million by 2025 (Metropolis, 2009).  Neoliberalism and globalization have had financial and economic  consequences for the cities labor pool.  The  mechanization  of  Sindh's  agricultural  sector  has  led  to  the  dominance  of  large  landlords  and  marginalization  of  wage  workers  and  small  landholders.  Karachi's  industrialization  and  reliance  on  export  led  growth  has  also  served  to  attract  rural  labourers  to  the  city  in  search  of  work.  The  informal  sector  has  grown  to  become  a  key  component  of  Karachi's  economic  activity  and  bridges  the  gap  between  the  informal  poor  and  lower  classes  which  provide  services  to  the  wealthy  (Khan,  D.S.,  1998;  Hasan,  A.,  2002).  The  informal  sector  provides  as  much  as  seventy  five  percent  of  the  jobs  in  the  city  (Hasan,  1992).  Informal  sector  labourers  provide  cheap  labor  to  undocumented  companies  that  avoid  `paper  policy  compliance  levels'  of  the  government  according  to  SMEDA  (Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  134   

Development  Authority)  and  the  ILO  (PILER,  2005).  This  number  is  swelling  due  to  unemployment  and  insecurity  in  rural  areas  and  a  lack  of  development  activity  (Khan,  D.S.,  1998).  Many  of  the  politically  active  and  socially  mobilized  members  of  the  informal  sector  are  2nd  and  3rd  generation  inhabitants  of  the  mega  city.  Many  informal  sector  labourers  reside  in  `katchi  abadis'  (informal  settlements).  As  a  result  of  their  permanent  residence  in  Karachi,  the  younger  informal  sector  labourers  have  limited  connections with their rural heritage (Hasan, A., 2002).   As  formal  approaches  to  planning  and  housing  fail,  migrant  labourers  turn  to  illegal  developers  and  the  land market to acquire a plot on which to build (Hasan, 1990). The problem is, surging levels of growth is  leading  to  stratification  within  the  informal  sector  and  those  without  access  to  skills  and  education  are  being  marginalized.  Macro  shocks  are  forcing  the  upwardly  aspiring  to  coalesce  with  their  poorer  counterparts  across  the  informal  sector,  forming  different  household  compositions  (Hasan,  A.,  2002a;  Hasan,  A.,  2002b).  The  informal  workers  occupy  a  unique  sociological  niche  in  society  that  is  under  researched and not appreciated (Khan, D.S., 1998). They are critical as they provide services to the lower  income  working  class,  even  though  their  presence  may  disrupt  traffic  and  flow  of  city  life  for  the  upper  income  residents.  Many  of  the  informal  sector  workers  and  poor  are  women,  who  occupy  precarious  positions  of  labor  in  garment  factories  and  other  informal  enterprises  linked  with  the  textiles  sector  (PILER,  2001,  2005).  And  yet  many  of  these  informal  sector  workers  navigate  through  social  and  economic barriers and challenges in order to carve out a livelihood and  contribute  to society (Ali, 2011).  As  conflict  increases,  their  informal  settlements  are  seen  as  `home'  relative  to  Karachi  as  a  whole  (Verglaik,  2009).   When  the  hawkers  of  Saddar  bazaar  were  evicted  in  the  1990s,  subsequent  dialogue  and  engagement  resulted  in  an  alternative  plan.  This  policy  turn  occurred  once  officials  realized  that  their  presence  was  required  for  economic  growth  (Hasan  et  al,  2008).  The  challenge  is,  that  as  light  engineering  and  manufacturing  shut  down  and  electricity  usage  increases,  there  may  be  fewer  opportunities for formal employment and informal sector wages may suffer (Hasan, 2002). 

5.2 Historical Overview
Historical  records  indicate  that  Karachi's  origins  were  as  a  small  fishing  village  which  started  almost  300  years  ago  (Wajidi,  2000).  The  population  of  Karachi  in  1729  was  250,  the  result  of  some  trade  and  port  traffic  in  the  17th  and  18th  centuries  (Hasan,  A.,  1999).    When  a  nearby  harbor  silted  over  from  heavy  rains,  merchants  relocated  to  the  smaller  port  of  Karachi.  Hyderabad  and  Thatta  were  historically  the  seats  of  power  in  Sindh  (Zaidi,  A.,  2000).  Between  1729  and  1783,  the  seat  of  power  changed  hands  as  135   

the  rulers  of  Sindh  tried  to  control  its  strategic  location.  In  1783,  Karachi  fell  under  the  control  of  most  powerful  family  at  the  time,  Sindh's  `Talpur  Mirs'.  The  ruling  family  erected  a  fort  at  the  entrance  of  the  town,  which  made  Karachi  impregnable.  The  town  population  was  13,000  in  1809  (Wajidi,  2000).  The  composition of Karachi was to experience dramatic changes with British rule.  In  1839,  Karachi  was  conquered  by  the  British  and  began  its  transformation  into  a  major  port  of  trade  and  commerce.  When  the  British  entered,  the  population was only 14,000 and  was composed mainly of  the  ethnic  Sindhis.  The  capital  at  the  time  was  Hyderabad.  When  the  capital  was  captured  in  1843,  the  annexation of the region by the British  began, dividing Karachi's  political significance.   It was soon made  the  capital  of  Sindh,  a  district  of  the  Bombay  presidency.  The  city  was  then  divided  into  British  settlements  and  the  native  city.  The  British  quarter  was  developed  with  civil  lines,  formalized  infrastructure  and  the  old  bazaar  of  Saddar.  A  flourishing  cotton  export  industry  drove  port  improvements and over time, large companies were developed to transport cotton and wheat down the  Indus,  across  the  bay  to  the  port.   Many  traders  moved  to  Karachi  and  the  population  increased  from  14,000  in  1838  to  57,000  in  1856.  During  this  period,  a  municipal  committee  was  set  up  for  Karachi,  the  first of its kind in British India.   British  rule  continued  to  guide  Karachi's  development  in  spite  of  resistance  and  external  change.  In  1857,  native  troops  rebelled  in  support  of  independence  from  the  British,  but  were  crushed.  This  continued  until  1861,  when  the  US  civil  war  disrupted  US  cotton  exports  and  the  material  was  increasingly  imported  from  the  rural  areas  of  Sindh  through  Karachi,  now  linked  through  a  robust  railway  line  (Zaidi,  A.,  2000).   From  1881  onward,  the  city's  population  doubled  with  the  opening  of  the  Suez  Canal  and  the  proximity  of  Karachi  to  the  empire.  Oil  extraction  in  Sui  and  pipelines  and  services  extended  to  the  city's  fringes,  shifting  the  population  and  contributing  to  urban  sprawl.  From  1901  to  1911  the  population  increased  by  thirty  seven  percent.  Migration  continued  well  beyond  independence  and  the  city's  population  continued  to  increase.  In  1935  Karachi  became  the  capital  of  Sindh  and  the  establishment  of  judicial,  parliamentary  and  other  government  offices  entrenched  the  political  role  of  the city, shifting attention away from Mumbai.  

5.2.1

Post-Colonial Institutional Setting

Following  independence,  Karachi's  growth  continued  to  surge,  spurred  by  geopolitical  changes  and  market  led  migration.  In  1947,  Karachi  had  a  population  of  45,000  and  city  boundaries  that  reached  out  136   

to  more  than  1,200  peripheral  settlements  and  villages  (Hasan,  A.  1997).  During  the  10  years  following  partition,  over  600,000  refugees  from  India  migrated  to  Karachi,  changing  the  ethnic  composition  and  power  balance  of  the  city.  The  resulting  political  tensions  and  ethnic  divides  have  persisted  since.  By  1951, the population of Karachi had swelled to over 1.1 million, mostly due to migrants from India (Zaidi,  A., 2000). The industrialization of agriculture saw Karachi's population grow to 3.6 million by 1972 as the  country's  exports  made  their  way  through  the  city  to  foreign  markets.  In  the  1980s,  waves  of  migrants  from  Soviet  occupied  Afghanistan  complicated  the  ethnic  scene  in  an  already  volatile  Karachi.  Migrant  Pakhtuns found employment in the industrializing city whose annual growth rate had declined, despite a  growing  population99.  The  resettlement  of  Pakhtuns  has  continued  unabated,  spurred  by  the  U.S.  led  war on terrorism, drone strikes and instability.  During  the  early  years  following  independence,  Pakistan's  administrative  structure  also  witnessed  a  steady expansion. Centralized power structures were accompanied by bureaucratic inefficiencies leading  to  an  elite  cadre  of  institutions  at  the  upper  tiers  of  the  state  (Islam,  N.,  1998).  The  creation  of  this  cadre,  embedded  in  the  Pakistan  Civil  Service  Academy,  mirrored  the  same  elitist  and  arrogant  approaches  to  civil  servant  development  as  its  Indian  predecessor.  In  colonial  era  fashion,  only  the  wealthy  and  elite  were  educated  and  admitted  to  the  service,  creating  sophisticated  social  and  class  based  networks  (Husain,  I,  1998).  Over  time,  waves  of  civil  service  graduates  displayed  a  persistent  contempt  for  Pakistan's  common  people  and  avoided  mixing  with  the  masses.  The  disengagement  of  this  elitist  bureaucracy  would  allow  them  to  wield  power  in  an  economically  driven,  donor  serving  economy.   This  behavior  would  also  be  passed  onto  policy  development  approaches  and  the  top  down  paternalistic approach that would move from period to period (Siddiqui, T., 2006).  Over  time,  this  upper  tier  became  increasingly  occupied  with  manipulating  weak  political  institutions  and  retaining  power  within  the  bureaucracy  (Islam,  N.,  2008).  Loose  coalitions  of  power  sharing

 In recent years, security studies and political economy have coined the term 'the Talibanization of Pakistan' in reference to the spread of  Islamic fundamentalism and a distinctively Afghanistan brand of Islam and Shariah law. However, security studies based references overlook  the lingering social and political effects of an unstable Afghanistan on Pakistan. The increasingly porous border and the sophisticated networks  of support, settlement, refugee migration and resettlement are features of recent history. Also, the resilience of the Pakhtun and their social  formation within the heart of Karachi's informal sector is understated and perhaps only understood by the antagonistic motivations of Karachi's  ethnopolitical parties. 

137   

followed,  as  landlords  morphed  into  an  industrial  class  and  mediation  with  military  leadership  entrenched  the  senior  levels  of  the  bureaucracy  in  a  role  that  shifted  with  political  times  (Zaidi,  A.,  2011).  An  underdeveloped  bourgeoisie  was  unable  to  usurp  political  control  from  a  bureaucracy  that  had  grown  accustomed  to  sustaining  the  colonial  apparatus  of  years  past  (Subramaniam,  2003).  The  literature agrees on the elitist culture of the state, with blame for policy failure shifting between military  appointed  and  democratically  elected  elites.  Although  pro  poor  policies  were  introduced,  they  were  not  accompanied  by  sufficient  resources  from  upper  tiers  due  to  gaps,  corruption,  lack  of  institutional  strengthening  and  political  will  (The  Network,  2006).  In  Karachi,  this  has  translated  into  stalled  devolution  plans,  continued  upper  tier  policy  dictates  and  the  inability  of  local  authorities  to  address  their  specific  needs  (Ali  and  Saqib,  2008).  Karachi  ranks  28th  out  of  110  districts  in  Pakistan  with  regard  to the intensity of deprivation faced by the urban poor (SDPI, 2012).  Policy analysis overlooks the growing demands of the increasingly dense mega city Karachi and its needs  for  autonomy  and  empowerment.  The  KMC/CDGK's  (Karachi  Municipal  Corporation/City  District  Government  of  Karachi)  marginalization  as  a  lower  tier  of  government  cannot  be  delinked  from  the  concentration  of  power  at  the  upper  tiers.  Local  government  frameworks  were  abolished  with  the  end  of  military  rule,  as  they  were  seen  as  instruments  of  the  army,  further  weakening  institutions  (Haider  and Badami, 2010). For example, following General Pervaiz Musharraf's failed devolution plan, Karachi's  jurisdiction  increased  and  rural  districts  along  the  fringe  which  were  previously  under  the  provincial  government  were  left  in  limbo.  This  has  failed  consistent  mayors,  local  bodies  investors  and  villagers  alike  (Hasan,  2014).  Furthermore,  senior  levels  of  the  bureaucracy  have  held  the  majority  of  power  without any plans of decentralizing or devolving decision making or resources (Abbassi, S., 2006; Khan et  al,  2007).    Reforms  which  attempted  to  allow  the  lateral  entry  of  technocrats  and  allow  for  more  oversight  were  simply  tools  employed  to  spread  the  patterns  of  patronage  (Hasan,  P.,  1998).    These  challenges  continue  to  constraint  administrative  development  within  the  mega  city  (Haider  and  Badau,  2010).  It  cannot  be  understated  that  the  political  actors  within  all  of  these  institutions  and  groups,  are  influenced  by  political  parties  such  as  the  Muhattada  Qaumi  Movement  (MQM),  Sindhi  nationalists  and  the  Awaam  National  Party  (ANP)  (Hasan,  2014).  The  ethnic  discord  persistently  rattles  Karachi's  institutional settings.  Ethnic politics, weak institutions and poor governance are leading to a lawless and  tribal  environment  in  Karachi  (Isran,  2014).  Studies  on  urban  Sindh  confirm  this  discord,  outlining  how  138   

many  elected  offices  are  removed  and  replaced  by  provincially  appointed  leadership.  This  has  led  to  demolition  of  katchi  abadis  (informal  or  unregulated  settlements)  and  goths  (small  hamlets)  alike,  for  political reasons (Hasan, 2014). Karachi's institutions have become weakened beyond strengthening and  require substantial lobbying and organization by citizens through community based organizations (CBOs)  and  facilitating  NGOs  to  extract  sustained  levels  of  service  from  lethargic  and  provincially  dependent  departments  (Zaidi,  A.,  1998).  There  have  been  several  calls  made  for  devolution,  but  efforts  towards  devolution  and  governance  reform  still  follow  the  same  patterns  as  in  the  past  Â­  much  on  paper,  but  little  in  the  way  of  implementation  that  will  get  the  necessary  machinery  moving  and  more  empowerment  at  the  lower  levels  of  the  state  (Ali  and  Saqib,  2008).  As  with  its  counterparts  in  Dhaka,  Karachi  is  in  need  of  reforms  to  address  weak  governance  mechanisms,  alternative  modes  of  service  delivery and participation of the poor in planning (Islam and Khan, 2007).  

5.2.2

The condition of municipal institutions

Karachi's  institutional  landscape  is  made  up  of  several  national,  provincial  and  municipal  institutions,  many  of  which  have  overlapping  mandates  and  functions.  The  KMC  (or  CDGK)  is  the  overarching  local  government  for  Karachi.  The  KMC  is  composed  of  10  towns  and  178  union  councils  (Metropolis,  2009).  The  institution  has  been  challenged  by  limited  capacity  building  and  even  dismissal  as  recently  as  1993.  The  latter  was  the  result  of  underdeveloped  constitutional  interpretations  by  concentrated  and  well  networked  political  and  bureaucratic  elites  (Zaidi,  A.,  2000).  The  experience  of  the  KMC  is  shared  by  local  governments  across  Pakistan,  revived  during  military  administrations  and  dismissed  by  democratically  elected  ones.  The  politicization  of  their  functions,  particularly  in  the  case  of  Karachi,  has  stunted  their  managerial  development  and  administrative  evolution.  It  is  widely  agreed  that  tensions  between  tiers of government  have crippled  the ability of the KMC to provide  sufficient levels of services  for Karachi's growing population (Wajidi, 2000 vs. Hasan, 2008).   The  KMC's  ability  to  provide  the  full  range  of  services  has  been  marginalized  by  limited  and  often  `pilfered'  revenue  streams.  Officially  the  KMC  is  responsible  for  planning,  development,  and  maintenance  of  roads,  lighting,  drains,  public  health,  sanitation,  solid  waste  management,  medical  services,  fire,  and  land  control,  removal  of  encroachments,  libraries,  galleries  and  social  welfare.  Many  local  schools  and  colleges  are  also  run  by  the  KMC.  Revenues  are  obtained  from  the  `octroi',  a  locally  collected  tax  from  Karachi's  residents.  The  amount  of  revenue  from  this  stream  has  not  been  reviewed  for  some  time  and  most  of  the  funds  are  siphoned  by  the  provincial  government.  Where  the  revenue  139   

streams  are  sufficient,  it  is  largely  due  to  slippage  in  capital  development  projects,  which  result  in  unused funds being siphoned to other operational, salary and `miscellaneous' budget items (AREC, 1993,  vol IA, p. 9). Other challenges facing the KMC include the actual number of property owners from whom  tax  is  collected.  In  many  cities  across  Pakistan,  the  transfer  is  only  fifteen  percent  of  the  total  revenue  base  (UU/WB,  2006).  Similar  to  the  lack  of  funds  obtained  from  the  province,  the  city  receives  insufficient grants from the federal government to meet its operating requirements (Wajidi, 2000).  The  Karachi  Development  Authority  (KDA)  is  responsible  for  managing  the  planning,  development  and  resale  of  land  in  a  city  under  increasing  pressure  from  market  forces.  The  KDA  reports  to  the  federal  government and works in parallel with the KMC. The KDA reports to the Government of Sindh's Ministry  of  Housing  and  Tehsil  Planning  (MoHTP).  The  KDA  is  governed  by  its  own  administration  and  legislation,  with  no  connection  to  local  government  (KMC)  legislation  or  frameworks.  The  KDA  runs  the  `Karachi  Master  Plan'  for  the  city,  administers  environmental  controls  and  allocations  of  land  for  residential  and  commercial  sectors  as  well  as  building  control  (Hasan,  1991).  As  the  KDA  is  continuously  under  pressure  from  development  lobbyists  to  allow  for  the  sale  and  rezoning  of  land,  it's  decisions  are  often  at  odds  with  other  municipal  institutions.  When  the  KDA  finds  itself  continuously  giving  in  to  political  pressure  on development it distances itself from the policies of other public institutions (Zaidi, A., 2011). The KDA  has  also  become  heavily  involved  in  managing  major  capital  investment  projects  and  city  planning  (AERC, 1993, vol 4, p. 1). The misaligned roles and responsibilities of the KDA and KMC have contributed  to inefficiencies in planning and management across the City.  Despite  the  development  of  Master  Plans,  the  KDA  has  not  been  able  to  provide  affordable  housing  for  all  segments  of  society  due  to  a  number  of  institutional  failures.  Master  plans  developed  from  1950  onward  were  on  such  a  small  scale  that  they  did  not  affect  the  overall  housing  situation  in  Karachi  (Hasan,  1992).  This  has  persisted  to  the  present  day  with  housing  plans  and  schemes  lagging  behind  a  surging  private  development  sector,  which  has  emerged  through  nepotism  and  collusion  with  state  officials.  Political  volatility  has  stymied  plan  development  but  has  not  resulted  in  alternative  solutions.  For  example,  the  Greater  Karachi  resettlement  plan  in  1958  was  on  a  grander  scale  than  current  plants  and  sought  to  relocate  the  city's  inner  city  squatters  to  the  outskirts.  After  relocation,  the  majority  of  resettled  squatters  moved  back  to  the  inner  city  to  be  close  to  places  of  work  (Hasan,  1992).  The  third  and  fourth  master  plans  for  Karachi  failed  as  they  spent  millions  of  rupees  only  to  move  and  house  a  fraction  of  the  urban  poor.    This  was  due  to  the  lack  of  affordability  of  the  schemes  and  lobbying  by  140   

development  groups  (Hasan,  A.,  1997).  The  Greater  Karachi  Master  Plan  has  been  politicized  and  the  process  continues  with  no  change  in  administrative  behavior  (Ecil,  2012).  Many  have  argued  that  revenue  generating  and  planning  powers  be  transferred  from  the  KDA  to  the  KMC,  to  align  planning  with  operational  concerns,  improve  financial  sustainability  and  generate  accountability  for  the  citizens  of Karachi (Wajidi, 2000; Hasan, 2008).  A  number  of  other  institutions  carry  out  municipal  functions  in  Karachi,  but  they  are  in  parallel  and  at  odds  with  one  another.  For  example,  The  Karachi  Electrical  Services  Corporation  and  the  Sui  Gas  Company are both energy  based utilities and should share some common management and governance  features.   However,  there  is  no  integrated  planning  (AERC,  1993).  A  myriad  of  national,  provincial  and  municipal  government  agencies  operate  in  Karachi  with  overlapping  roles  and  responsibilities100.  Karachi.  Public  administration  researchers  have  pointed  to  the  absence  of  a  single  coordinating  body  as  the  reason  for  duplication  and  conflict  between  planning  and  implementation  between  various  departments (Wajidi, 2000).   Water and Sanitation is managed by local utilities across the country's larger towns and cities. It was not  until  1979,  that  the  Karachi  Water  and  Sewerage  Board  (KWSB)  was  established  for  the  management  of  water  and  sanitation  needs  of  Karachi.  The  KWSB  is  a  subsidiary  of  the  KMC  as  defined  by  the  local  government  ordinance.  The  KMC,  as  such,  must  provide  the  KWSB  with  sufficient  funds,  as  per  the  ordinance,  to  sustain  its  operations.  This  has  been  contested  in  recent  years,  with  the  Ministry  of  Sindh  and  KMC  both  battling  for  control  of  the  KWSB  and  its  steady  flow  of  water  revenue.  The  KWSB  had  undergone  substantial  reorganization  to  decrease  its  staff  numbers  and  operating  costs.  However,  the  result  of  provincialMQM  wrangling  was  the  deputation  of  political  party  staff  (MQM)  to  the  utility  to  ensure  that  its  policies  remained  in  alignment  with  party  dictates.  Caught  in  the  midst  of  this  intergovernmental tug of war, the KWSB continues to be indirectly impacted by  the KMC's development

 SITE, Sindh Highway Department, planning and development of the government of Sindh, various cooperative housing societies, KPT, Port  Qasim authority, Pakistan steel mills, airport development authority, national highway authority, national mass transit authority, Pakistan  public works department, civil aviation and military estate services are all national, provincial and local government agencies with 

141   

planning  priorities  and  directly  dependent  on  the  KMC  for  funds101  (even  though  it  should  be  empowered  for  selfsufficiency  from  the  water  rate).  A  number  of  studies  have  called  for  structural  and  management  reforms,  but  there  has  been  a  lack  of  provincial  will  to  disentangle  its  interests  from  the  utility. 

5.2.3

Calls for Political and Administrative Reforms

Although  many  civil  society  and  private  sector  commentators  have  called  for  state  led  reforms  to  address  the  mega  city's  poor  state  of  service  delivery,  resistance  from  political,  economic  and  ethnic  factors  has  stalled  progress.  A  declining  state  of  law  and  order  has  been  exploited  by  rising  gang  violence.  Insecurity  rooted  in  ethnic  and  sectarian  tensions  has  been  complicated  by  the  war  on  terror  leaving  deeper  divides  unresolved.  I  will  elaborate  on  these  root  causes  during  my  discussion  of  the  water  and  sanitation  service  delivery  context.  In  spite  of  such  volatility,  a  number  of  initiatives  have  been launched to deal with the social realities of unplanned development and seemingly unmanageable  service  delivery  to  the  informal  sector.  A  few  key  organizations  have  struggled  to  mitigate  the  negative  effects of poverty and improve human development.  During the 1990s, the provincebased Sindh Katchi  Abadi Authority (SKAA) established itself as a public sector model of onewindow housing assistance and  service  delivery  to  the  poor  (Government  of  Sindh,  2011;  Zaidi,  A.,  2008).  Unfortunately,  once  the  leadership  of  then  Director  General  Tasneem  Siddiqui  departed,  the  SKAA  became  defunct.  Once  ex  DG  then  move  to  the  not  for  profit  sector,  the  institution  retreated  from  engaging  the  informal  sector.  Despite  the  decline  and  marginalization  of  the  KMC,  the  corporation  has  only  recently  begun  to  engage  a small group of registered NGOs (CDGK, 2011). This is reflective of the slow, yet discernible trend found  across  Pakistan  in  which  the  state  is  moving  away  from  being  the  monopoly  provider  of  social  services  and  is  outsourcing  service  delivery  for  a  range  of  social  services  to  nonstate  actors  (Anwar,  H.N.  and  Zafar, M.N., 2003).   

                                                                  
101

 The electricity bill of the KWSB continues to be subsidized by the Sindh provincial government. It is but one illustration, in financial terms, of  how the KWSB remains dependent on the province for service continuity. The province in turn, refuses to empower the KWSB with support or  authority in improved revenue recovery support, permitting and encouraging the dependency on the KMC for funds. 

142   

A  number  of  `selfhelp'  oriented  civil  society  actors  have  struggled  for  recognition  and  acceptance  in  Karachi, despite the slow response from state actors. Since the 1960s, followers of Akhtar Hameed Khan  and Abdul Sattar Edhi have sought to make up for Karachi's poor state of service delivery in sectors from  water  and  sanitation  to  health  care.  The  number  of  nonstate  actors  has  also  grown.  Pakistan  currently  has  approximately  45,000  citizen  organizations  employing  about  300,000  persons  and  200,000  full  time  volunteers.    While  state  engagement  is  inconsistent,  the  legal  framework  is  enabling  for  an  otherwise  fragmented civil society (Zaidi, A., 2008). Civil society actors concerned with service delivery have left an  impression  on  Karachi's  informal  settlements  by  working  in  cooperation  with  lower  tier  state  actors.   Over  time,  these  service  delivery  oriented  civil  society  actors  have  contributed  to  high  level  policy  documents such as the national housing and shelter  and national  sanitation policy, which clearly outline  the role of civil society actors (GOP, 2006; Hasan, 2007). However, policy implementation is complex and  civil  society  actors  in  housing  and  shelter  (SAIBAN)  as  well  as  water  and  sanitation  (OPP  RTI)  recognize  that  change  will  take  time.  Despite  the  calls  for  reform,  devolution  and  decentralization  of  power  from  upper  tiers  of  government  has  been  ineffective  (Khan  and  Cheema,  2005).  A  once  technical  assistance  oriented  donor  sector102  has  turned  to  large  infrastructure  projects  to  international  and  where  possible  local engineering, consulting and service providers (ADB, 2008).  The result  has been the  engagement of  large  scale  projects  and  firms,  at  the  expense  of  local  initiatives  that  take  into  account  long  term  sustainability  and  community  ownership.  Institutional  strengthening  and  addressing  malgovernance  is  not  a  high  priority.  The  effects  of  misaligned  institutions  and  uncoordinated  development  activity  by  nonstate  actors  have  had  a  range  of  outcomes  for  informal  settlements.  I  now  turn  to  a  discussion  of  their implications for the water and sanitation context of Karachi. 

5.3 Water and Sanitation Context
Karachi's  water  and  sanitation  service  delivery  context  illustrates  how  a  weak  institutional  and  governance  framework  can  be  exploited  by  state  and  nonstate  interests  to  the  detriment  of  the  public                                                                    
102

 Several confidential consulting reports were reviewed and referenced through anonymous interviews and strongly recommend the  institutional strengthening of the KWSB by the province. Persistent levels of political neglect have led to the departure of many donors from the  Sindh water and sanitation sector, until the political will to enable and empower the KWSB and its mandate emerges.  

143   

good.  A  political  economy  of  water  supply  and  pilferage  has  drained  the  KWSB  of  service  delivery  losses  in  the  billions  of  rupees.  Upper  tier  neglect  and  elite  capture  of  public  goods  have  drawn  a  response  from  civil  society  groups.  A  number  of  selfhelp  models  have  led  to  advocacy  for  water  supply  and  sanitation  solutions  for  informal  settlements.  As  a  result,  the  majority  of  households  in  Karachi  have  piped  water  connections  and  improved  sanitary  lines  (UN  Habitat,  2013).  Unfortunately,  issues  of  water  pressure,  supply  and  overall  service  persist.   When  the  supply  of  services  is  scarce  conflict  results  along  class and ethnic lines.   Water  supply  and  distribution  is  the  mandate  of  the  KWSB.  The  utility  has  suffered  from  institutional  neglect,  politicization,  insecurity  and  a  lack  of  horizontal  support  from  adjacent  departments.  According  to  many  consultants,  donors  and  civil  society  actors;  the  utility  is  in  a  state  of  crisis.  Current  leadership  includes  a  visionary  managing  director  with  some  support  from  a  few  senior  directors,  armed  with  a  plan  to  reduce  nonrevenue  water.    His  recognition  of  advocacy  and  service  delivery  oriented  civil  society actors has broadened recognition of KWSB's weaknesses and intention to reform. In the absence  of  the  24/7  provision  of  water  supply,  bulk  water  distribution  to  `awami  tanks'  (free  tanks)  have  been  used  for  consumption  in  partnership  with  local  CBOs,  NGOs,  private  and  informal  sector  actors  (Ahmed  and  Sohail,  2003).  Partnerships  with  nonstate  actors  are  turbulent  as  the  utility  is  trying  to  shift  the  burdens  of  revenue  collection  away  from  commercial  ratepayers  towards  households.  While  the  wealthy  are  unwilling  to  pay,  the  utility  has  turned  to  the  poorer  communities  who  civil  society  actors  complain are not receiving adequate supplies.   Responsibilities  for  Karachi's  sanitation  collection  and  treatment  are  more  complex  as  trunk  mains  once  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  KMC,  have  now  shifted  to  the  KWSB.  Low  cost  sanitation  solutions  developed  in  partnership  with  civil  society  have  yielded  immediate  benefits  at  the  laneway  and  household  level,  where  communities  have  built  box  drains  and  collection  networks  under  the  guidance  of  the  OPP  RTI  (Orangi  Pilot  Project  Research  and  Training  Institution)  network.  The  majority  of  these  low  income  communities  have  thus  been  regularized  through  water  and  sanitation  connections  and  documentation  as  per  the  above  stated  Katchi  Abadi  acts  and  legislation.   A  number  of  Goths  or  villages  in the surrounding periphery are being absorbed and are under the threat of eviction. Extending services  to  these  communities,  whose  jurisdictional  boundaries  are  contested  between  provincial  and  municipal  politicians,  is  difficult  and  has  resulted  in  violence.  Wastewater  reuse  has  been  proven  for  agricultural  application in small towns of Sindh, but it is yet to be seen on a larger scale for cities (IWMI, 2002).   144   

Stormwater  management  is  linked  to  sanitation  and  demands  state  attention  as  development  and  climate  change  result  in  seasonal  flooding.  For  example,  blocked  and  encroached  drains  are  a  growing  problem  across  the  mega  city  (Rehman,  2004).  The  KMC  has  now  taken  ownership  of  drainage  cleaning  and  de  silting  from  the  KWSB.  A  concern  is  that  this  will  likely  result  in  zoning  and  bylaw  enforcement  with  respect  to  illegal  developments  and  settlements.  In  all  service  delivery  streams,  low  income  settlements  along  the  expanding  urban  fringe  are  likely  to  experience  lower  levels  of  service  from  a  utility under siege by elite interests. 

5.3.1

Political representation

Primary  and  secondary  research  revealed  that  politicians  are  not  interested  in  engaging  and  providing  permanent  service  connections  to  low  income  settlements.    The  reason  for  this  is  that  many  elected  officials  withhold  access  to  services  until  political  support  and/or  votes  are  secured.  Interviews  and  documented  reports  from  low  income  communities  revealed  that  citizens  found  politicians  to  be  of  no  use  in  facilitating  water  supply  to  the  settlement  despite  it  being  such  a  critical  resource  (Ahmed,  N.,  2008).  NGO  representatives  have  expressed  some  optimism  with  the  `slow  and  steady  approach.'  According  to  one  prominent  director,  `when  political  representatives  have  been  approached  for  involvement,  they  may  over  time  `support'  civil  society  led  efforts,  but  they  have  not  been  found  to  be  proactive.'103  Deeper  examination  of  implementation  constraints  reveals  indirect  interference  and  politicization  of  lower  tier  service  providers  by  elected  leadership  at  the  upper  tiers  of  government.  On  this point, NGO activists and researchers have raised attention  to organized  crime, at a risk to their own  efforts.  Primary  research  and  interviews  with  lower  tier  state  and  nonstate  actors  revealed  the  involvement  of  politicians and upper tier state functionaries in the operation or sustainment of illegal hydrants.104 These

 Interview with NonGovernment Organization Director, Karachi, November 7th, 2013   A KWSB operator was killed while operating an illegal hydrant. Initially, staff members thought that the individual was a representative of an  extremist group and violence was related to ethnic tensions.  However, investigations later revealed that his death was a targeted killing, the  result of a feud over control of the illegal hydrant and the division of revenues among different political actors. These actors were found to be  high ranking MNAs and MPAs from the federal government. In fact, upper tier actors have even approached appalled KWSB staff on 'how to  establish a private, illegal hydrant'. 

145   

hydrants  are  essentially  illegal  connections  to  public  water  supply  mains.    This  network  of  illegal  hydrants  drives  Karachi's  water  tanker  industry,  which  services  those  parts  of  the  city  that  struggle  with  low  water  pressure.  According  to  the  water  tanker  association,  over  forty  percent  of  the  water  to  the  city  is  supplied  by  the  tanker  industry.  There  are  over  5,000  registered  water  tankers  of  various  sizes  operating  in  the  city.  Civil  society  actors  point  out  that  if  the  KWSB  were  able  to  supply  water  to  all  of  these  homes,  tanker  operations  would  halt  (Rahman,  2004).  Otherwise,  the  ongoing  theft  of  public  water formalizes the city's dependency on an illegal practice (URC, 2009).    In order to further their control over the utility, elected officials have contributed to the current state of  mismanagement that plagues the KWSB.  Soon after a substantial downsizing of the utility's labour force  in the 1990s, the KWSB was forced to redouble its size and take on several thousand political appointees  from  the  PPP  and  MQM.  An  interview  with  a  KWSB  official  drew  the  following  response  `we  know  what  to do with the KWSB in order to turn it around. We have seen it with other utilities. However, there is no  political will in lieu of all of the political appointments. I have had elected officials come to me personally  asking  for  the  establishment  of  an  illegal  hydrant  to  line  their  own  pockets.'105  This  behaviour  highlights  the  political  influence  on  the  KWSB  by  the  country's  most  powerful  political  parties  at  the  expense  of  effective  management,  service  delivery  to  the  water  rate  payer  and  the  underserved  informal  sector  (Ahmed  and  Khan,  2006).    Karachi's  professional  stakeholders  do  not  receive  political  backing  or  recognition, which is a source of problems for planning (Hasan, 2014).   KWSB  management  has  indicated  `despite  years  of  independently  funded  studies  and  donor  led  lobbying  for  institutional  reform,  it  has  been  difficult  to  convince  politicians  of  the  need  to  adopt  a  transparent  business  model.'106  Documents  from  the  past  two  decades  outline  several  initiatives  launched  at  regional  conferences  (South  Asia  Conference  on  Sanitation),  but  little  implementation  is  seen  on  the  ground  (MOE,  2006;  Rahman,  2012).  Multilateral  donors  are  also  only  interest  in  moving  forward  with  projects  where  there  is  structural  commitment  from  the  highest  levels  of  the  province.  Civil  society  commentators  point  to  high  level  policies  as  the  result  of  civil  society  lobbying  and

engagement  with  lower  tier  actors  (Khan,  Siddiqui  and  Hasan  interviews,  2014).  I  turn  to  this  group  of  lower tier state actors in the next section. 

5.3.2

Administrative accountability/transparency

Primary  and  secondary  research  revealed  little  evidence  of  regular  reporting,  audits  or  process  reviews  across  the  KWSB.  Donor  and  technical  reports  conclude  that  this  is  the  result  of  a  troubled  relationship  between  the  utility,  upper  tiers  of  the  state  and  adjacent  departments  (JICA,  2008).  Despite  normally  being silent on threats to its operations, KWSB management has admitted  that  pilferage results in  thirty  seven  percent  losses  to  a  water  supply  which  does  not  meet  seventy  five  percent  of  demand  (WB,  2012).   The  result  is  fifty  percent  of  losses  to  the  bottom  line  (KWSB,  1989).  The  lack  of  funds  results  in  the  absence  of  24/7  service,  the  prevalence  of  waterborne  illnesses,  treatment  of  less  than  ten  percent  of wastewater and metering of only ten to fifteen percent of the total number of accounts. Senior KWSB  officials  have  lamented  `by  the  end  of  the  month,  with  only  two  days  to  spare,  the  Executive  Director  is  always  scrambling  to  address  cash  flow  issues  so  that  we  can  make  payroll.'107  Energy  expenditures  constitute twenty nine to fifty seven percent of the utility's total budget (KWSB, 2014).   Primary  and  secondary  evidence  also  revealed  misalignments  between  agencies  and  organizations  that  engage  the  KWSB  (Welle,  2006;  Hasan,  2014).  The  KWSB  alleges  that  it  is  often  over  charged  for  electricity  by  a  power  utility  that  cannot  ensure  adequate  supply.  Tensions  have  also  persisted  between  the  KMC  and  KWSB  as  to  which  institution  would  assume  responsibility  for  the  city's  storm  water  drainage  system.  The  city's  `nalas'  are  often  clogged  with  solid  waste  and  require  constant  cleaning  and  desilting.  When  seasonal  flooding  brings  the  issue  to  media  outlets,  the  KMC  regularly  directs  responsibility  to  the  KWSB.  An  already  resource  strapped  KWSB  is  then  forced  to  focus  solely  on  drainage  management,  neglecting  other  operational  priorities.  This  places  downward  pressure  on  the  financial  position  of  the  utility,  forcing  it  to  return  to  the  KMC  for  financial  assistance  (OPP  RTI,  2000).  Donor  driven  loans  and  top  down  projects  have  also  added  to  the  KWSB's  debt.  When  the  KMC  has  withheld support, a debt burdened utility is then forced to appeal to the province for funds. The political

economy  of  utility  sustainment  has  seen  power  over  the  KWSB  oscillate  between  the  MQM  dominated  KMC  and  PPP  dominated  province  of  Sindh  (OPP  RTI,  2000).  The  structural  disconnections  between  the  utility  and  the  province  are  not  recognized  by  other  state  actors.  KWSB  representatives  have  complained  `Our  directives  continue  to  shift  between  the  provincial  PPP  led  government  and  the  municipal  MQM  party  thugs.  It  is  difficult  to  take  good  ideas  that  put  the  utility's  interests  first  and  position  them  in  a  way  that  is  politically  acceptable  to  either  of  the  two  parties.    PPP  directives  are  usually stalled by the MQM and vice versa.'108 The reporting relationship to the province is troubled and  technical motivations for reform are largely led by nonstate actors109.   There  is  little  accountability  within  and  across  the  utility  itself.  Financial  risks  and  management  ineptitude  abounds  (JICA,  2008).  There  is  no  evidence  of  the  routine  publishing  of  official  reports.  The  steady  deterioration  of  performance  is  a  result  of  discriminatory  provision  of  water  supply.    Years  of  political  and  administrative  mismanagement,  incompetence  and  corruption  in  operations  and  oversight  have  resulted  in  KWSB  producing  negligible  invisible  resources  to  address  gross  deficiencies  in  basic  services  (Ercelawn  and  Nauman,  1996).  When  asked  about  regular  reporting,  KWSB  representatives  respond  `noone  reads  the  reports  that  we  produce.   The  media,  civil  society  and  others  all  listen  to  the  `spin'  that  politicized  messages  present.  We  have  had  a  good  forum  or  two  with  some  NGOs  (URC  forum)  but  they  do  not  result  in  change,  just  knowledge  sharing.   We  also  know  that  poorly  paid  staff  members  are  being  paid  off  by  members  of  the  water  mafia.  We  can  do  nothing,  otherwise  our  supervisors  and  staff  risk  death.'110  Most  of  KWSB  key  performance  initiatives  or  measurements  are  disclosed  as  part  of  donor  driven  capacity  building  projects.  Bulk  water  theft  proves  a  lack  of  coordination  across  state  actors,  between  the  army,  police  and  civilian  service  delivery  providers  (Rahman,  2004).  Donors  such  as  the  Japanese  Institute  for  Cooperation  and  Aid  (JICA)  have  also  echoed  the need to reduce political interference and operate the utility on a recovery basis (JICA, 2008).

5.3.3

Intergovernmental support and policy failures

Primary  and  secondary  research  reveals  little  intergovernmental  support  for  lower  tier  state  actors  beyond  a  culture  of  `policy  formalism'.  Lower  tier  actors  such  as  the  KWSB,  are  not  autonomous  and  continue to depend upon upper tiers of the state for decision making and resources. Although a number  of  acts  and  laws  regarding  local  government  exist,  they  have  not  been  accompanied  by  resources  for  program  implementation  and  improved  service  delivery  (JICA,  2008).  For  example,  investment  in  the  water sector is 0.16 percent of GDP as compared to between 0.2 percent and 0.4 percent of comparable  international  utilities  (KWSB,  2014).  In  fact,  upper  tier  state  actors  have  been  lobbied  by  nonstate  actors  to  draft  the  national  water  and  national  sanitation  policies,  which  take  into  account  the  realities  of  the  informal  sector  (Hasan,  2013).  Donors  such  as  the  World  Bank  also  lobby  upper  tier  state  actors  (in  particular  the  province's  minister)  for  implementing  institutional  autonomy  at  the  lower  tiers  and  delegating sufficient funding models for utility operations (WSP, 2014). As a result of lobbying by donors  and  other  lower  tier  state  actors,  an  urban  policy  and  development  cell  has  been  created  within  the  Government of Sindh to build capacity at the lower tiers of the state (GoS, UPSC, 2014).   Research  evidence  shows  that  upper  tier  state  actors  often  draft  policies  with  little  consideration  for  municipal  capacity  and  infrastructure.  In  2002,  the  GoP  launched  the  country's  national  sanitation  strategy  at  the  first  regional  South  Asia  Conference  on  Sanitation  (SACOSAN)  in  Dhaka.  Although  the  strategy  contains  plans  for  Tehsil  Municipal  Association  (TMA)  development  at  the  city  and  town  level,  there is no reference to larger cities, despite large sewage plan outlays (GoP, 2006). Commentators have  argued  that  while  the  upper  tiers  of  government  seek  to  increase  supply,  they  neglect  the  challenges  of  water  losses,  pilferage  and  contamination  (Hasan,  2002).  Even  when  a  plan  is  funded  (i.e.  ADB  funded  Karachi  Sewage  Plan),  conflict  between  all  three  levels  of  government  results  in  project  failure  (Hasan,  2014).  Furthermore,  new  plans  do  not  incorporate  new  infrastructure  into  existing  KMC  built  lines  or  CBO  developed  laneway  box  and  sewage  collection  networks.  Similarly,  new  plans  advocate  for  increasing the capacity of treatment plants while neglecting the lack of coordination and convergence of  the  existing  collection  system  (secondary  sewer  lines  feeding  the  main  trunks  are  regularly  supplemented  by  storm  water  from  the  nallas).  Glaring  disconnections  between  proposed  plans  and  existing  infrastructure  layouts  has  drawn  harsh  criticism  from  civil  society  actors,  who  claim  that  larger  donor led projects will only incur more debt on the city.  

149   

Research  also  reveals  a  lack  of  capacity  building  for  the  KWSB  from  upper  tiers  of  government.  The  lack  of  delegation  of  authority  results  in  misalignments  with  the  courts,  electricity  board,  province,  land  board  and  revenue  (JICA,  2008).  Interviews  with  KWSB  managers  raised  several  challenges  `we  know  what  to  do  to  turn  around  the  KWSB,  but  we  have  no  support  from  the  police,  politicians,  other  departments and our provincial/municipal masters.  Our staff members continue to receive threats from  the  MQM  all  the  time,  should  they  try  to  follow  procedures  that  are  not  to  the  liking  of  political  parties.'111  State  and  nonstate  efforts  to  resuscitate  the  utility  are  isolated.  Progress  on  infrastructure  mapping  is  stalled  by  resistance  from  `sector  based  institutions'  at  upper  tiers  of  the  state,  such  as  KDA  influence  on  the  KMC  (WSP,  2014).  Nevertheless,  some  upper  tier  commentators  recommend  that  the  KWSB  be  delinked  from  upper  tier  institutions  such  as  the  development  authorities  to  ensure  efficient  operation  and  semiautonomy112.  Critics  counter  than  such  `partial  solutions'  will  experience  limited  success,  if  top  down  grant  distribution  thinking  continues  (Shah,  2014).  Structural  changes  are  required  to  address  the  management  challenges  of  skilled  labour  shortages,  obsolete  rules,  asset  and  work  mismanagement  and  poor  financial  management.  For  example,  area  based  management  would  make  service  delivery  easier  if  the  city  were  divided  into  hydraulic  zones  with  dedicated  metering,  community  engagement  and  shared  oversight  (WSP,  2014).  These  challenges  are  faced  in  the  housing  sector  where  a myriad of institutions has made legal low income programs near impossible to start.  According to one  social  entrepreneur  `we  spent  years  trying  to  establish  tracts  of  land  dedicated  for  the  urban  poor  and  informal  settlements,  but  there  were  so  many  other  institutions  that  were  accustomed  to  stalling  the  process  by  waiting  for  bribes.    Every  time  we  approached  these  upper  tier  actors  with  the  intent  of  doing  the  work  legally,  we  were  told  it  will  never  work.   As  a  result,  we  have  started  to  work  only  with  the  local  government  departments  where  they  have  land  allocated  for  formalizing  informal  settlements.'113  Policy  evidence  suggests  that  the  lack  of  intergovernmental  support  is  the  result  of  shifts  in  KWSB  reporting  to  municipal  and  provincial  stakeholders.  The  competition  for  influence  over  the  KWSB  is  no

doubt as a result of its revenue generating ability. Prior to 2012, the KMC's governance  model had been  altered  by  the  military  administration  (with  the  approval  of  the  MQM)  to  fit  a  more  nationally  molded  district  government  model,  renamed  as  the  CDGK.  By  2012,  the  CDGK  had  returned  to  its  provincially  designed  model  as  the  KMC.  At  this  time,  an  agreement  was  reached  between  the  KWSB  and  KMC  for  the  latter  to  assume  responsibility  for  maintain  the  drainage  systems  of  the  city.  In  principle,  the  KMC  would develop the natural nalas and drainage canals as box trunk lines to serve as the main disposals for  sewage  and  rain  water  across  the  mega  city114.  As  of  2014,  work  on  more  than  70  percent  of  the  city's  box  trunks  and  drainage  canals  across  the  city  had  been  completed  (OPP  RTI,  2012).  In  2012,  the  KWSB  compiled  and  issued  a  list  of  125  illegal  hydrants  operating  in  Karachi  and  requested  that  upper  tier  authorities dismantle them115.  While this number is far below what OPP RTI says are in operation, it is a  significant step towards exposing the key stakeholders in Karachi's water mafia as well as the challenges  of deplorable interagency cooperation (URC, 2012).   Staff  accounts  from  the  KWSB  point  to  the  recommendations  of  a  2010  published  JICA  report  which  outlines  institutional  reform  through  the  segregation  of  bulk  water  sale  from  retail  sale  (to  be  outsourced).  According  to  KWSB  experts,  `the  study  is  without  doubt,  the  most  thorough  analysis  of  KWSB's operating environment and constraints. There has been a KWSB review and response to the JICA  report,  which  recommends  the  development  of  internal  controls  and  oversight  measures  as  part  of  broader  institutional  reforms.  However,  no  steps  have  been  taken  as  of  yet116.'  In  2012,  the  KWSB  continued the publishing of its list of illegal hydrants in the city, listing the name, owner and district.  The  majority  are  in  district  west  and  number  over  100.  Under  the  directive  of  the  IG  Sindh  and  in  cooperation  with  the  police  department,  warnings  have  been  given  to  the  hydrant  operators.   Despite  repeated threats of enforcement action, there has been little evidence of actual hydrant shut down (The  News, 13/9/2012).                                                                    
114

 In strategic terms, one might argue that such a network could easily pave the way for provincially led development in areas where sufficient  sewage and drainage has been mapped out.  115  According to the KWSB report, there are 93 illegal hydrants operated in west district, 12 in east, 10 in central and one in Malir. This number  is disputed by the OPP RTI, whose detailed maps, flow analysis and financial revenue calculations point to over 300 illegal hydrants in operation  across Karachi.   116  Interview with KWSB Senior Official, Karachi, November 16th, 2013  

151   

The  intergovernmental  challenges  and  policy  failures  that  face  the  KWSB  are  indeed  rooted  in  a  lack  of  revenue  and  sustainability.  Unfortunately,  there  is  limited  energy  being  dedicated  to  the  search  for  alternative  service  delivery  solutions  (JICA,  2008).  For  example,  the  KESC  is  cooperating  with  nonstate  actors  to  establish  decentralized  alternative  energy  pilot  projects  to  reduce  the  load  from  a  centralized  power  system  under  stress  (URC,  2012).    Such  efforts  are  scarce  in  water  supply  and  sanitation.  Alternative  solutions  gloss  over  reforms  and  visit  privatization  efforts  and  the  unbundling  of  the  KWSB  into  separate  operational  units  for  public  or  private  operation.  Little  thought  is  being  given  to  making  the  entity  more  functional  and  operational,  in  light  of  the  external  constraints  highlighted  by  nonstate  actors (Bengali and Shah, 2003; Rahman, 2004). 

5.3.4

Citizen engagement or pro-poor engagement

Primary  and  secondary  research  reveals  differences  of  opinion  between  state  and  nonstate  actors  in  the  level  of  services  being  provided  to  the  informal  sector.  Lower  tier  state  actors  within  the  KWSB  and  other  infrastructure  oriented  departments  insist  that  informal  settlements  are  provided  with  better  service  than  upper  income  communities.  In  fact,  key  informants  pointed  to  the  fear  of  protests  which  has  kept  service  levels  to  the  informal  sector  above  average.  In  contrast,  civil  society  reports  reveal  a  range  of  customer  criticisms.    A  survey  by  the  Network  recently  revealed  key  recommendations  from  concerned  citizens  regarding  the  poor  state  of  existing  schemes,  inequity  in  water  bill  payments,  poor  water  quality  and  the  need  for  joint  planning  (The  Network,  2005).  A  WSP  funded  citizen  report  card  also  revealed  areas  for  improvement  in  governance,  citizen  engagement  and  service  delivery.  Only  6.5  percent  of  respondents  indicated  a  level  of  satisfaction  with  services  (WSP,  2010).  Another  World  Bank  survey  also  pointed  to  the  need  to  establish  dedicated  programs  for  informal  settlements  and  service  delivery outreach in cooperation with long established nonstate actors (Rizvi, 2009).  Evidence  regarding  the  history  and  state  of  citizen  engagement  across  income  groups  is  both  mixed  and  complex.  For  instance,  some  low  income  areas  claim  periodic  service  delivery  and  inflated  bills  whereas  KWSB  staff  claim  that  they  receive  better  service  than  upper  income  groups.  All  interview  respondents  agree  that  periodic  services  are  common  across  the  city  and  there  is  less  enforcement  on  revenue  collection  in  lower  income  areas.  However,  surveys  reveal  the  overwhelming  levels  of  service  that  planned  areas  receive  as  opposed  to  ten  to  thirty  percent  coverage  in  informal  settlements  (AERC  Surveys,  1989).  To  resolve  this,  the  `Awami  tank'  program  was  used  in  recent  years  to  pilot  the  distribution  of  water  to  low  income  communities  through  CBOs.  In  the  absence  of  sufficient  oversight,  152   

the  program  (fed  by  the  tanker  industry)  fell  into  political  hands  (Ahmed  and  Sohail,  2003).  Over  time,  illegal water  tankers have  paralyzed supply in  the city by parasitizing  the  utility's main water points.  The  KWSB is unable to prosecute the upper tier actors who operate these hydrants, due to cooption and the  pay  offs  of  KWSB  staff.  Enforcement  regarding  illegal  hydrants  is  a  moot  point  as  the  KWSB  is  empowered  to  collect  regular  payments  from  its  larger  clients.  The  result  is  that  informal  settlements  and low income areas become the scapegoat for falling revenue collections of the utility as a whole117.    In  recent  years,  KWSB  management  has  engaged  nonstate  actors  regarding  the  utilities  challenges  and  how  to  increase  service  delivery  to  lower  income  communities  in  order  to  build  a  stronger  customer  base.  In  response,  nonstate  actors  have  analyzed  the  constraints  and  challenges  to  KWSB  operations  and  placed  service  delivery  to  the  informal  settlements  in  perspective.  The  priority  of  issues  requiring  resolution have more to do with source water, distribution (formal and informal), illegal hydrants, power  shortages,  organizational  difficulties  and  alternative  solution  development  (Rahman,  2008).  Nonstate  perspectives  on  service  delivery  seek  to  consolidate  the  interests  of  low  income  communities  and  the  KWSB,  which  are  already  aligned,  in  order  to  build  a  grass  roots  support  for  the  KWSB's  capacity  and  future  capability  to  deal  with  an  expanding  mega  city  population.  I  now  turn  to  the  activities  of  non state actors that have informally, if not formally, extended KWSB's service delivery. 

5.3.5

Donor/Civil society activity

Primary  and  secondary  evidence  reveals  significant  donor  and  civil  society  activity  in  the  water  and  sanitation  sector.  Service  delivery  extension  to  informal  settlements  has  been  largely  attributed  to  efforts  of  survey  data,  mapping,  training  and  advocacy  by  technical  experts  within  Karachi's  development  community.  Although  most  of  their  efforts  have  linked  community  based  solutions  with  utility  infrastructure,  relations  with  state  actors  has  yet  to  be  formalized.  Despite  this  constraint,  civil  society  actors  such  as  the  Urban  Resource  Centre  (URC),  OPP  RTI,  Pakistan  Institute  for  Labor  and  Economic  Research  (PILER)  among  others  are  collaborating  on  water  and  sewage  issues  and  have

 Analysis of returns on investment in capital infrastructure and security for each hydrant, compared against the lost revenues of pilfered  water show that minimal allocations in security for public services can lead to quick returns in improved service delivery to all citizens.

formed  a  water  and  sanitation  network  for  Karachi  (Wateraid,  2008).  Their  initial  focus  was  on  challenging  the  proposed  privatization  of  water  and  sewerage  services  in  Karachi.  In  parallel,  they  have  analyzed  the  feasibility  of  foreign  funded  projects  to  expand  utility  capacity.  In  response  to  capital  intensive  approaches,  this  network  drafted  a  low  cost,  phased  alternative  plan  based  on  existing  city  finances.   The  KMC  and  KWSB  have  approved  the  plan  as  `The  Karachi  Sewerage  Plan  S  III  (KSP  S3)'.  It  will  be  implemented  through  the  city  government's  finances  with  the  KWSB  acting  as  the  lead  implementing  agency.    The  feasibility  and  governance  component  of  this  plan  has  led  to  the  network  being officially recognized by the KWSB (URC, 2007). As a result of this recognition, the URC and OPP RTI  are  collaborating  to  develop  a  water  supply  and  management  plan  for  the  city,  which  incorporates  the  needs of poor communities, addresses institutional  mismanagement and inequities in distribution  (URC,  2009).  The  OPP  is  one  of  the  most  celebrated  civil  society  examples  of  `selfhelp'  community  led  development.  By  combining  community  capacity  with  relevant  municipal  authorities,  the  OPP  RTI  has  facilitated  project management to extend sewage collection and water service connections to informal settlements  (Fernandes,  K.,  2002;  Plus,  1998;  Welle,  2008).    It  is  important  to  note  that  the  OPP  RTI  has  accomplished  this  by  engaging  and  cultivating  the  capacity  of  KWSB's  midlevel  engineers  and  administrators.  Unlike  their  upper  tier  counterparts,  these  lower  tier  officers  are  not  as  `upwardly  mobile'  or  are  they  transferred  like  higher  ranking  officers  across  different  administrative  portfolios  (Hasan, A. 2008; Pervaiz et al, 2008). Similarly, the OPP RTI has cultivated community capacities through  education  and  technical  support.  A  survey  of  `lane  managers',  community  activists  whose  efforts  have  been  supported  by  OPP  RTI  and  have  galvanized  individual  households  into  approaching  the  city  for  services, speaks to the value of community owned development approaches (OPP RTI, 2008).  The OPP has also been an outspoken critic of the political economy of water supply in Karachi. Research  led  by  the  late  Executive  Director,  Perween  Rahman,  established  linkages  between  increases  in  water  pilferage  and  nonrevenue  water  losses  that  continue  to  erode  KWSB's  financial  health.  OPP  RTI  publications  highlight  the  sophisticated  linkages  between  upper  tier  state  actors  and  the  criminal  underworld  that  actively  steal  from  the  public  water  supply  and  resell  water  illegally.  Illegal  water  providers  often  provide  water  at  prices  10  to  15  times  greater  than  public  tariffs  provided  by  the  KWSB  (WB,  2012).  Ironically,  illegal  bulk  water  tankers  operate  alongside  private  tankers  while  sell  `public  water'  through  ranger  managed  hydrants.    OPP  RTI  has  long  pointed  out  that  the  erosion  of  KWSB  154   

revenues  is  reducing  funds  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  existing  infrastructure,  resulting  in  a  dependency  on federal funds. Although the situation for reform seems hopeless, OPP staff solutions are  simple  `KWSB  management  needs  to  acknowledge  and  broadcast  the  poor  financial  state  of  the  utility  after  which  reforms  and  tactics  can  be  developed.    At  present,  they  seem  to  be  accepting  the  dismal  state  as  normal.'118  Upper  tier  resources  are  signed  off  on  by  the  very  actors  pilfering  the  public  supply  (Rahman,  2008).  A  concession  based  contract  has  been  proposed  as  an  option  by  the  GoS  in  1997;  to  which civil society has protested (GoS, 2008).  The  key  benefits  of  OPP  RTI  engagement  of  CBOs  are  social  mobilization,  capacity  development  and  community  design.  Social  mobilization  involves  problem  solving  and  conflict  resolution  between  neighbors  (lack  of  agreement  on  progress  and  fund  collection),  with  contractors  (poor  quality  work),  with  city  officials  (to  get  operations  and  maintenance  work  orders  completed)  and  within  the  community  (to  take  ownership  of  operations  and  maintenance  work  when  selfhelp  was  determined  to  be  the  solution)119  (OPP  RTI,  2008).  Capacity  building  has  led  to  success  through  community  supervision  of  line  construction.   CBOs  soon  found  that  donor  led  projects  involved  contractors  using  poor  quality  pipe  as  inspections  were  irregular  or  nonexistent  (OPP  RTI,  2008).  Contractor  discipline  has  helped  OPP  RTI  and  KWSB  work,  where  large  lucrative  contracts  with  high  end  contractors  have  been  replaced  by  local  masons  and  local  SMEs  (Zaidi,  A.,  2000).  Criticisms  regarding  the  quality  of  OPP  RTI  designs  and  managed  work  have  emerged  from  municipal  engineers  and  technocrats.    Nevertheless,  the  same  criticism  has  been  applied  to  the  quality  of  KWSB  and  CDGK  managed  work,  by  CBO  lane  managers  and  NGO  reps  (OPP  RTI,  2008).  OPP  RTI  leadership  continues  to  press  for  more  recognition  of  the  governmentcommunity  partnership  that  feeds  local  designs  to  meet  the  needs  of  laneways  and  communities  (Rahman,  P.,  2004).  Audits  of  OPP  RTI  work  have  been  met  with  positive  reviews  by  its  technically  oriented  donor  Â­  WaterAid,  and  efforts  towards  advocacy  are  encouraged  as  OPP  is  invited  to provide more technical guidance on larger projects (WaterAid, 2001).

 Interview with NonGovernment Organization Executive Director, Karachi, November 17th, 2012   This is not to say that officials or any one party was to blame, but when external conflicts arise (ethnic tensions, insecurity) or internal  discord (state/nonstate roles and responsibilities, neighbours quarrelling, contractor management, quality control, etc.); having an impartial  and well equipped entity on the ground helped to keep the process moving.

Although  OPP  RTI  surveys  reveal  the  approval  of  land  tenure  for  almost  all  of  Karachi's  `katchi  abadis',  the  struggle  for  tenure  in  the  peri  urban  fringe  is  intensifying  across  intergovernmental  lines.  Karachi's  original  city  limits  have  been  approved  for  land  tenure,  making  them  `regularized'  or  `formalized  low  income areas'. As such, OPP RTI has shifted its focus to the perimeter of `Goths' (settlements) situated in  a  ring  around  the  Karachi  city  limits.  The  ring  is  4  to  5  km  wide  and  extends  as  far  as  7  km  at  some  points.   In  total,  the  ring  of  2,173  goths  more  than  doubles  the  overall  size  of  the  city  (OPP  RTI,  2011).   OPP  RTI  has  found  a  lack  of  accountability  by  intergovernmental  authorities.  A  technical  training  resource  centre  (TTRC)  has  been  set  up  in  Orangi  and  youth  architects  are  working  beyond  Orangi  to  map  and  plan  out  the  Goths  of  Karachi.    The  TTRC  also  provides  guidance  and  support  for  the  EM  sewage  treatment  units  (OPP  RTI,  2012).    Other  centres  developed  by  OPP  RTI  and  now  manned  by  youths  are  assisting  with  technical  support  to  other  Goths  around  Karachi's  periphery.  This  ring  of  villages  and  low  income  settlements  is  caught  in  a  territorial  struggle  between  the  province  (PPP)  and  the  municipality  (MQM)  (Hasan, 2012). In order  to obtain land  tenure, residents are required to  provide  documentation  to  the  Sindh  Katchi  Abadi  Authority  (urban  settlements)  or  the  Sindh  Revenue  Department  (outer  rural  settlements)  showing  that  the  village  existed  before  1985120.  The  problem  outlined by key informants from the KWSB, is obtaining recognition for the settlements' existence within  the  jurisdictions  of  the  provincial  or  the  municipal  government.  As  MQM  and  PPP  influence  grows  the  municipality's jurisdiction, the span of the KWSB's responsibility only grows.     Recognition  of  OPP  RTI's  maps  has  served  to  advance  discussion  around  formal  sewage  and  water  service  plans  for  the  expanding  city.  Initially,  KWSB  S3  was  criticized  for  not  taking  into  account  linkages  with  NGOs  who  have  done  low  cost  sanitation  in  the  past  (ADB,  2002).  However,  by  2007,  the  Sindh  Government  approved  Rs.  900  million  for  the  development  of  9  more  drains,  designed  by  OPP  RTI  and  serving  many  low  income  settlements  spread  over  8  towns.   Rs.  2.6  billion  was  allocated  in  the  budget  for  the  KWSB  S3  plan  (OPP  RTI,  2012).  In  2007,  the  KWSB  took  some  steps  to  engage  NGOs  and  announced  a  new  policy  for  providing  water  connections  to  poor  communities  and  katchi  abadis  at  a

 Residents from at least 40 households are required to provide birth and death certificates, identification cards with the address of the old  goth, old mail envelopes, or a document from a court proceeding.

fifty  percent  reduced  rate.  In  2009,  the  KMC  began  the  construction  of  Phase  1  of  Khairabad  drainage  project, encompassing 17 goths  (40,000 houses). In addition to other drainage projects, OPP RTI designs  have  been  approved  by  the  KMC  and  Rs.  189  million  has  sanctioned  for  Phase  1  and  2  of  the  KWSB  S3  plan.  OPP  RTI  develops  the  plans,  obtains  ministry  approval,  city  approval,  monitors  project  management  (follow  up  with  the  CM  for  the  Provincial  government  and  KMC  engineers),  provides  work  plans  to  KMC  engineers,  and  supervises  construction,  while  mobilizing  the  community  to  monitor  work.  This plan of engagement has been replicated in other state led support programs. The technical support  of Wateraid for OPP RTI's engagement with the KWSB is unparalleled (OPP RTI, 2012). Many multilateral  donors  have  collaborated  on  the  WSP  effort  to  establish  pilot  projects  based  on  the  OPP  model  (WSP,  2011). Other  organizations such as DFID have also noted  the success of the  OPP RTI model and  the gaps  that it is filling in providing `sharing oriented models' that encourage community ownership (DFID WELL,  2006).  While  these  efforts  benefit  from  increased  private  sector  involvement  and  tools  to  engage  the  communities  and  establish  standalone  utilities,  the  critique  of  short  circuiting  slow  and  steady  community mobilization may see more negatives play out (WSP, 2012; OPP, 2009).  In  contrast  to  the  success  of  the  OPP  RTI,  large  donor  funded  projects  persist  and  divert  focused  attention  on  community  led  efforts.  Upper  tier  solutions  to  improving  service  delivery  still  reside  largely  in  capital  intensive,  high  investment  projects  that  assume  a  critical  capacity  and  interest  by  lower  tier  state  and  community  representatives.  They  overlook  the  needs  for  community  strengthening  and  organization, which is where OPP RTI spends most of its time and energy. Donors continue to fund state  plans  for  large  water  and  sanitation  development  projects,  despite  the  lessons  of  past  projects.  In  several  cases,  years  were  spent  in  development  which  led  to  complacency  by  state  officials  and  the  contracting out of solutions rather than developing internal management frameworks (Hasan, A., 1998).  One  of  the  strengths  of  the  OPP  RTI  model  is  that  it  recognizes  that  its  role  cannot  replace  that  of  the  state (Rahman, 2006; Zaidi, A., 2000). As with other commentators, the OPP RTI advocates for the KWSB  to  be  given  the  power  to  perform  as  an  effective  level  of  government  (Zaidi,  A.,  2000).  The  solution  is  the  connection  of  main  lines  and  trunks  to  community  developed  distribution  and  collection  networks.  Modest systems are the solution, which are not a drain on capital resources (Hasan, 2014). The approval  of  new  development  loans  are  linked  to  donor  pressure.  The  existing  infrastructure  which  is  in  need  of  repair and should be charged to O&M funds, is neglected, a result of the donor led culture at the KWSB.

5.4 Case Studies
I  now  turn  to  two  case  studies  which  illustrate  the  dynamics  between  upper  and  lower  tiers  of  the  state  in enabling or disabling service delivery to the informal settlements of Karachi. 

5.4.1

The

Case

of

Dost

Muhammed

Jungar

Goth:

A

Successful Outcome
Since  the  1990s,  the  OPP  has  been  assisting  Karachi's  peri  urban  informal  settlements  with  applications  for  land  tenure  and  basic  services.  In  many  cases,  the  efforts  to  lobby  service  providers  have  been  long  and drawn out.  In others, where the community has been mobilized and accompanied by the economic  interests  of  commercial  groups,  service  access  has  been  expedited.  The  latter  situation  has  been  experienced  in  Dost  Muhammed  Jungar  Goth  which  serves  as  the  city's  largest  vegetable  market  for  its  main  economic  activity.  Since  the  engagement  with  OPP  RTI,  and  the  cross  subsidization  of  services  between  commercial  and  residential  actors,  access  to  water  and  sewage  services  has  improved  almost  immediately. In fact, the seamless manner in which the community was able to organize and engage the  KWSB, makes it one of OPP RTI's most dramatic turnaround case studies. 

5.4.1.1 Background
Dost  Muhammed  Jungar  Goth  is  located  along  Karachi's  northern  city  limits,  next  to  one  of  the  mega  cities  key  arteries121.  The  community  is  composed  of  a  residential  area  located  behind  a  thriving  marketplace.  As  of  2008,  the  settlement  was  composed  of  107  lanes  and  1,020  houses,  accounting  for  over  6,000  people.  The  goth  is  home  to  the  largest  wholesale  market  in  the  country  which  spread  over  100 acres with three divisions including fruits, vegetables, onions and potato. The market meets the fruit  and  vegetable  demands  of  Karachi  in  addition  to  driving  a  robust  export  market.  Over  500  trucks  move  through the market on a daily basis.

 'Superhighway' runs from Karachi north to Punjab and connects the major agricultural markets of both provinces. The vegetable market used  to be located far from the highway, but as the market grew Â­ it moved closer to transportation infrastructure in an effort to relieve congestion.  Some refer to the current position of the Goth as 'New Sabzi Mandi'. 

158   

In recent years, criminal activity has been on the rise, causing Karachi's Dost Muhammed Jungar Goth to  become a `mini Bajaur'122, with a  deteriorating state of law and order. The goth  has suffered  from social  and political interference, due in part to the growth of a `shadow economy' of illegal service providers. If  continued  insecurity  closes  the  wholesale  vegetable  and  fruit  market,  traders  warn  it  would  cease  the  supply of fruits and vegetables to over 18 million residents of Karachi and have negative effects on other  markets, distributors and growers. Sindh's agricultural minister has since requested the assistance of the  Pakistani  Military's  Rangers  and  the  launching  of  a  cleanup  operation  in  the  area  behind  the  super  highway.  Traders  have  pointed  out  however,  that  the  Rangers'  presence  has  not  ceased  extortion  practices (The Express Tribune, 25/4/2014).  The  illegal  encroachment  of  public  spaces,  shops,  unauthorized  occupation  and  illegal  possession  of  open  spaces  in  the  relocated  goth  by  `outsiders,'  posing  as  criminals  and  outlaws  (undermining  revenue  collection by  the  market committee),  has been a  cause for complaints by  the  markets traders. The vocal  group  of  commercial  actors  allege  that  the  presence  of  outsiders  is  the  result  of  the  negligence  of  the  goth's  governing  `market  committee'.  Residential  and  commercial  stakeholders  allege  that  corruption  within  the  market  committee  has  led  to  the  illegal  encroachments,  fake  allotments  of  land  and  continues to violate the mandi's formal plans.    While seven years had passed since the shifting of the Dost Muhammed Jungar Goth from the University  Road to its new location, the absence of services continues.  In fact, residents continue to wait for water  connections, electricity meters, natural gas and paved roads; despite donor funds of Rs. 304 million. The  law  and  order  situation  in  the  market's  vicinities  has  escalated  the  murder  of  a  trader  by  extortionists.   Traders  took  action  by  striking  and  demanding  that  the  government  take  immediate  steps  to  stop  extortion.  Army  Ranger  forces  have  been  asked  to  check  encroachment  and  ensure  that  the  sanitation  environment  of  the  Mandi  is  at  least  maintained.  The  committee  members  criticized  the  administration

 'Bajaur' is a town which was suspected to be a base for militants with links to Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Over a number of months, a rise in  criminal activity led to a deteriorating social conditions and prompted military intervention. Successive incursions, raids, military operations and  relief efforts have traumatized the local population, resulting in continued unrest and migration to surrounding areas.  

159   

of  the  market  and  its  administrator,  in  particular,  for  noncooperation  with  the  committee  in  streamlining the working of the market and indulging in malpractices.  There  has  also  been  tension  between  the  Fresh  Fruit  Merchants,  Growers  Association  as  well  as  the  Market Committee. An advisory committee was set up to look after the daytoday affairs of the market,  improve  fee  collection  by  eliminating  pilferage  of  funds  and  fees,  removal  of  encroachments,  improve  sanitation,  regulate  power  supply  and  ensure  proper  water  supply,  but  so  far  nothing  had  been  done  due  to  cooperation  by  the  current  administrator.  Despite  a  number  of  meetings  with  township  authorities  and  millions  of  rupees  spent  in  project  proposals  and  contract  awards,  there  has  been  no  progress made by the market committee in obtaining services. 

5.4.1.2 Intervention
The  woes  of  Dost  Muhammed  Jungar  Goth's  commercial  actors  are  multiplied  due  to  the  shortage  of  power  supply  and  tap  water.   The  association  points  to  the  growth  of  the  illegal  "Kunda  system",  while  those  who  were  provided  legal  power  connection  were  suffering.  The  potable  water  supply  condition  in  the  Mandi  had  also  grown  miserable.  The  water  meant  for  consumers  at  the  Mandi  had  been  diverted  to  the  nearby  settlements,  and  whatever  water  was  made  available  to  the  Mandi  was  supplied  in  odd  hours.  It  was  suggested  that  instead  of  changing  the  water  pipeline  in  the  market  at  a  cost  of  Rs  4.5  million,  the  project  should  be  handed  over  to  the  Karachi  Water  Board  for  replacing  the  damaged  pipelines.  The  KWSB  and  OPP  RTI  were  then  engaged  by  the  community  to  establish  water  supply  connections  as  well  as  low  cost  sanitation  solutions  to  the  market  community's  lane  ways.  In  terms  of  internal  development,  it  would  be  managed  by  the  CBO.  In  both  Dost  Muhammed  Jungar  and  Haider  Goths  (comprising  of  1,855  houses  and  196  lanes),  with  OPP  RTI  technical  guidance,  the  community  mobilized  more  than  Rs.  6.25  million  for  external  development  by  the  government  for  water  connections.  Work  onsite  was  soon  completed  with  13,420  feet  of  main  and  secondary  sewers  have  been  laid.  OPP  RTI  provided  onsite  technical  guidance.   Internal  development  for  linkages  to  a  total  of  20  lane  sewers  (16  on  selfhelp  and  4  by  government)  and  2  secondary  sewer  lines  (5,228  feet)  had  also  been  laid.    288  houses invested  Rs.  1.63  million  on  latrines  and  sewers.   As  additional  lanes  gather  the  necessary  funds,  internal development is planned to continue. 

160   

As  of  2011,  sewage  collection  networks  along  4  lanes  are  serving  19  houses  where  Rs  14,383  has  been  collected.  KWSB  staff  responded  by  connecting  to  4  lanes  and  19  houses  for  Rs.  65,265.  Water  lines  serving 7 homes and 664 houses for Rs. 981,248 have been collected. The government has connected to  3  lanes  and  58  houses  for  a  total  of  Rs.  91,350.  In  terms  of  External  Development,  Investment  by  the  government  and  the  people  is  tabulated  to  be  2  secondary  water  lines  for  2,250  feet  at  Rs.  141,750  and  1  water  main  of  1,800  feet  for  Rs  169,200.  The  proposed  sewage  line  extends  from  the  drainage  main  along  the  Superhighway  along  the  Goth  and  towards  the  back  of  the  vegetable  market  where  the  four  blocks of homes are situated (OPP RTI, 2010).  This  case  study  demonstrates  the  ability  of  the  lower  tier  nonstate  actor  (CBO)  to  build  consensus  and  mobilize  resources  to  obtain  service  delivery  access.  More  specifically,  the  consensus  of  social  and  economic  interests  across  the  community  was  instrumental  in  pushing  state  actors  to  expedite  service  delivery  access.  Although  the  OPP  claims  to  have  had  minimal  involvement  in  the  effort  (beyond  technical  guidance)  this  case  illustrates  the  benefit  of  nonstate  actor  facilitated  engagement  of  lower  tier  state  actors  for  common  infrastructure  development  needs.  In  the  absence  of  sufficient  political  representation  and  intergovernmental  support,  civil  society  and  donor  activity  has  been  able  to  sustain  the service delivery agenda, by pushing for accountability of lower tier state actors.

This area has witnessed the rapid and seamless extension of the water and sewerage line to the Goth.  A  contributing  factor  may  very  well  be  the  need  for  the  commercial  interests  within  the  market  to  ensure  a  steady  supply  of  water  and  sewage  services  to  ensure  timely  processing  of  market  transactions.  While  violence  has  continued,  the  presence  of  criminal  activity  linked  specifically  to  the  pilferage  and  illegal  supply  of  water  has  dropped  to  negligible  levels.  The  village  and  community  have  benefitted  from  two  subsidies.  The  merchants  living  there  provide  a  market  for  services.  The  merchants  also  have  the  knowledge  to  transfer  the  connections  and  access  to  the  residences.  The  cost  of  the  connections  could  easily have been borne by the market, which in turn could have subsidized the goth's access to services.  In  fact,  this  area  represents  the  first  time  that  a  CBO  has  been  able  to  engage  the  state  with  minimal  intervention  by  the  OPP  RTI,  much  to  the  latter's  delight.  Commentators  question  whether  this  really  serving  a  low  income  area?  Or  is  it  more  subsidization  of  services  between  household  and  commercial  interests.   It  does  raise  the  value  of  subsidies  and  the  ongoing  interaction  with  the  state  that  has  paved  the way for ease of engagement. The coordinating role of the OPP RTI with the KWSB has been shown to  161   

be  of  benefit  not  only  to  residential  interests,  but  also  commercial  groups.  I  would  argue,  that  the  case  demonstrates  the  efficient  access  to  services  facilitated  by  the  OPP  and  CBO  in  comparison  to  other  profit oriented groups.

The Case of Ghazi Goth: An Unsuccessful Outcome

Since  the  1960s,  the  OPP  has  been  assisting  low  income  settlements  (katchi  abadis)  with  survey,  mapping,  community  mobilization  and  advocacy  for  `component  sharing'  based  water  and  sanitation  services.  By  the  1990s,  all  of  the  `katchi  abadis'  within  Karachi's  `city  limits'  had  been  awarded  tenure,  through  documentation  and  service  connections  with  KWSB.  Since  then,  OPP  RTI  has  been  assisting  villages  and  towns  or  `goths'  around  the  ever  expanding  urban  fringe  to  obtain  tenure.  Ghazi  Goth  is  situated  in  the  immediate  periphery  of  Karachi's  peri  urban  fringe.  It  is  one  of  many  small  settlements  which  is  struggling  for  documentation,  recognition  and  service  delivery  from  the  municipal  authorities.  The  political  dynamics  that  constrain  the  efforts  of  the  CBO  and  OPP  RTI  to  obtain  services  makes  it  an  example of disabling variables to development. 

5.4.2.1 Background
Ghazi  Goth  originated  in  1980  as  a  multi  ethnic  settlement  in  the  north  western  periphery  of  Karachi,  along  the  border  of  Orangi  (the  home  of  Akhtar  Hameed  Khan's  seminal  nongovernment  organization,  the  Orangi  Pilot  Project)  and  Deh  Halkani.   The  goth  is  situated  between  a  poorer  low  income  housing  settlement  (along  a  major  traffic  corridor)  and  a  largely  open  area  where  future  development  is  being  planned by the province. The goth's struggles with obtaining land tenure and service delivery are shared  by  other  goths  along  the  peri  urban  fringe,  caught  between  provincial  and  municipal  jurisdictional  authorities.    Ghazi  Goth's  dynamic  CBO  illustrates  the  benefits  of  community  dialogue  and  collective  engagement  of  state  actors  to  obtain  services123.  There  are  a  total  of  1,652  houses  that  are  home  to  over  7,000  residents.  Although  Ghazi  Goth  is  less  dense  than  metropolitan  Karachi,  its  households  are  larger.                                                                    
123

 In many other communities, the lack of services quickly degenerates into ethnic and sectarian clashes with limited collective thought as to  collective engagement of the state. 

162   

According  to  community  leaders,  the  Goth  boasts  one  of  the  most  peaceful  and  yet  mixed  groups  of  ethnic  and  religious  groups  who  live  in  harmony.  Ethnic  Balochis,  Kashmiris,  Punjabis,  Mohajirs  and  others  experience  peaceful  relations,  relative  to  other  informal  settlements.  In  terms  of  infrastructure,  there  are  noticeable  gaps.  The  community  is  made  up  of  a  total  of  140  lanes  connected  by  1  main  road,  4  secondary  roads  and  137  primary  roads.  There  are  32  water  connections  that  are  required  per  lane.   There  are  no  government  facilities  except  for  5  police  stations.  There  is  1  private  school  along  with  4  health  clinics  and 6  Masjids (OPP RTI, 2011). CBO leaders point  to  the increase in unity that has resulted  from  the  mobilization  of  a  relatively  diverse  community  and  establishing  shared  needs  for  basic  infrastructure and services.  The  health  and  sanitation  challenges  that  face  Ghazi  Goth  are  common  to  several  low  income  communities  across  Karachi.   There  is  no  official  access  to  piped  water  to  the  community's  households.  The  survey  drawings  and  layout  of  the  Goth  reveal  the  use  of  soak  pits  by  all  laneways  and  households.  Each  pair  of  homes  shares  a  common  soak  pit  which  results  in  the  prevalence  of  waterborne  and  gastrointestinal  diseases.  During  rain  events,  these  pits  overflow,  which  spreads  waste  into  the  streets.  The  persistence  of  soak  pits  has  affected  the  health  and  wellbeing  of  residents,  particularly  the  young  and  old,  according  to  CBO  representatives.  Household  tensions  result  from  the  discharging  of  refuse  between homes into pedestrian walkways and common areas where children play. The  extension of the  lines  to  all  residences  of  the  Goth  will  also  make  expansion  to  additional  homes  coverage  simple  (OPP  RTI, 2011). 

5.4.2.2 Intervention
In  2009,  OPP  RTI  engaged  the  residents  of  the  goth  and  assisted  in  the  establishment  of  a  CBO  through  which  to  engage  the  lower  tier  KWSB  and  KMC  for  water,  sewage  and  drainage  service.  Several  maps  and  surveys  were  initiated  by  OPP  RTI  staff  in  collaboration  with  the  community.  After  much  lobbying  and  engagement,  the  CBO  application  for  a  connection  was  accepted  by  the  KWSB.  A  distribution  line  for  water  as  well  as  a  drainage  main  for  sewage  would  run  from  the  nearby  water  main.  The  main  collection line for sewage would discharge waste into a nearby open drainage canal.  In  November  of  2011,  construction  of  the  Goth's  sanitary  and  water  mains  was  underway.  The  community  had  completed  survey  and  mapping  efforts  with  the  help  of  OPP  RTI.  The  CBO  had  also  mobilized  laneways  to  amass  sufficient  funds  for  the  purchase  of  internal  component  materials.  The  CBO  had  by  this  time,  engaged  lower  tier  municipal  actors  to  install  the  sewer  mains.  The  KWSB  and  its  163   

contractors  began  work  with  OPP  RTI  staff  as  well  as  the  community  activists  supervised  the  onsite  work. 4,820 feet of main sewers (12 to 15 inch diameter) were laid.    As  construction  continued,  representatives  of  elected  officials  and  party  activists  took  notice.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  project  was  being  undertaken  with  the  `perceived'  support  of  a  PPP  led  provincial  administration,  the  party  with  the  most  support  in  rural  Sindh  and  the  areas  outside  of  Karachi.  This  raised  the  ire  of  MQM  activists  in  the  area,  who  had  benefitted  from  a  pattern  of  `votes  for  services'.  The  MQM  has  always  dominated  management  structures  across  the  KMC  and  KWSB.  Any  provincially  funded  projects,  would  infringe  on  the  degree  of  political  clout  held  by  them  across  the  goth.  MQM  activists  first  offered  cash  to  Goth  residents  to  withdraw  their  financial  support  for  the  project.  When  the  goth's  residents  refused  to  concede,  MQM  activists  approached  the  contractor  with  threats  on  the  lives  of  their  workers.  The  contractor  felt  threatened,  and  stopped  work.  Community  activists  are  now  lobbying  the  government  to  restart  work.  In  the  meantime,  sewer  mains  have  been  laid  at  a  nearby  abadi,  the  Shah  Khalid  colony.  This  community  is  significantly  smaller,  and  is  comprised  of  only  17  lanes  and  234  houses.    During  the  last  period,  at  the  request  of  the  community,  the  mapping,  planning,  estimating  for  three  secondary  and  12  lane  sewers  was  provided.   The  effort  is  ongoing  for  laying  the  secondary sewers (OPP RTI, 2012).  The  infrastructure  and  layout  of  the  Goth  makes  the  installation  and  laying  of  pipe  simple.   As  of  June,  2012,  Ghazi  Goth's  community  of  140  lanes  and  1,652  houses  has  requested  the  installation  of  sewer  main  disposal  lines  (9,246  feet).    Accordingly,  the  required  infrastructure  was  designed.  For  instance,  homes  are  modest  and  there  is  substantial  room  to  attach  service  connections  without  encroaching  on  neighboring  properties.  Similarly,  the  roads  and  pathways  are  large  enough  and  do  not  suffer  from  illegal encroachments common to low income areas near Karachi's core. The lane ways are wide and the  divisions  of  different  sized  homes  make  the  laying  of  pipe  and  connections  to  homes  straight  and  continuous. The `L' shape layout of the Goth leaves only a 90 degree elbow for the lines to connect.  This  will  also  make  the  ease  of  manhole  cover  development  easier,  as  long  as  they  are  of  good  quality  (OPP  RTI, 2012). Lanes are straight and installation from a technical perspective is not impeded by anything.  In  terms  of  the  application,  the  Ghazi  Goth  Welfare  Society  has  submitted  an  application  for  OPP  RTI  to  intervene  and  push  the  state  to  resume  construction  and  line  development  activities  (Ghazi  Goth  Welfare  Society,  2011).  The  reason  for  the  delay  is  the  lack  of  clear  roles  and  responsibilities  between  the  province  and  the  municipality  in  terms  of  jurisdiction.  The  MQM,  in  control  of  Karachi,  is  struggling  164   

for  recognition  and  political  assertion  in  the  fringe,  which  falls  more  into  rural  Sindh,  the  long  held  political  territory  of  the  PPP.    Lower  tier  municipal  functionaries  have  visited  the  settlement  on  many  occasions and in principle, had approved of the connections. However, as the KWSB is being fought over  by  the  KMC  (MQM)  and  the  MoS  (PPP),  development  is  being  halted  and  started  as  a  result  of  political  interference.  According  to  community  activists,  `Political  actors  and  party  activists  have  been  reported  to have gone door to door to all of the informal settlements' inhabitants, threatening physical harm and  the  lives  of  their  families,  should  legal  water  connections  through  the  CBO  be  laid.'124  The  CBO  efforts  have  been  robust  and  letters  of  approval  from  the  KWSB  for  the  laying  of  water  and  sanitation  lines  exist. Due to the interference of MQM and PPP actors in urban and provincial land development efforts,  the laying of water lines has yet to be completed (OPP RTI, 2013).  This case study demonstrates the ability of lower tier state and nonstate actors to develop a sustainable  plan  for  service  delivery  infrastructure  to  an  informal  settlement.  A  strong  emphasis  on  state  and  non state cooperation through networking and relationship building has been a hallmark of the OPP RTI. The  component  sharing  and  incremental  growth  models  pioneered  by  the  OPP  RTI  were  established  as  a  result  of  shared  responsibilities  between  communities  and  lower  tier  state  actors.  It  also  illustrates  the  adverse  effects  of  upper  tier  and  political  party  interests  which  extract  rents  from  informal  settlements  in  an  environment  of  policy  failure.  The  negative  effects  of  intergovernmental  tensions  at  the  political  and  administrative  layers  of  government  cannot  be  ignored.  It  is  likely  that  similar  struggles  for  service  delivery along Karachi's expanding urban fringe will continue in the years ahead. 

5.4.2.3 NextSteps
There  is  development  taking  place  to  200  meters  to  the  north  east,  where  a  markaz  (series  of  low  rise  shops)  that  will  likely  draw  more  utility  requirements.  Such  peripheral  development  may  incur  more  active  KWSB  and  KESCO  involvement  in  the  area.  It  may  also  result  in  some  resolution  as  to  the  jurisdictional  issues  that  hinder  Ghazi  Goth's  access  to  services.  On  the  other  hand,  the  political

economy  and  pacification  of  interests  may  also  be  complicated  as  stakeholders  are  paid  off  as  more  money will be coming into the community.

5.5 Karachi's comparator variables and case studies
Primary  and  secondary  evidence  from  Karachi  reveals  a  history  of  marginalized  municipal  development.  Politicized  upper  tiers  of  provincial  and  municipal  governments,  bearing  the  impressions  of  colonial  rule  and  elitism  has  persistently  neglected  the  needs  of  lower  tier  service  delivery  actors.  The  absence  of  political  representation,  intergovernmental  support  and  insufficient  pro  poor  initiatives  points  to  continued  neglect  by  the  state's  ruling  elite  and  elected  officials.  However,  in  country  research  has  revealed  the  prominent  role  of  one  comparator  variables  in  extending  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements.  Civil  society  and  donor  activity  has  continued  to  fight  the  inertia  and  barriers  presented  by  upper  tier  actors  and  elite  interests,  by  facilitating  the  engagement  of  informal  settlements  and  representative  CBOs  with  lower  tier  state  actors  such  as  KWSB.  The  persistent  lobbying,  knowledge  sharing  and  relationship  building  with  KWSB  and  KMC  officers  by  community  based  actors  (OPP  RTI  and  the CBOs) has led to the extension of water supply to and establishment of sanitation services. Although  these  efforts  have  been  successful,  there  has  been  a  limited  response  from  utility  service  providers,  namely the KWSB. The operations of the KWSB are mired in party based politics and patronage conflicts  that  pit  municipal  staff  between  provincial  bureaucrats  and  municipal  officials.  Although  members  of  the  senior  management  team  understand  the  need  to  break  the  vicious  cycles  of  patronage,  pilferage  and  debt;  there  are  fears  of  retribution  by  organized  crime,  colluding  with  party  leader  at  both  levels  of  government.  These  fears  have  been  realized  in  the  targeted  killings  of  utility  operators  and  the  assassination  of  Perween  Rahman,  the  Director  of  the  OPP  RTI,  who  had  long  amassed  research  implicating  the  water  tanker  mafia  in  the  institutional  erosion  of  the  KWSB.  The  success  of  service  delivery to informal settlements hinges on NGO facilitated mobilization of CBO actors.   The  influence  of  the  comparator  variables  is  illustrated  in  the  case  studies.  Outcomes  from  Ghazi  Goth  and  Dost  Muhammed  Jungar  Goth  reveal  the  crucial  role  of  technical  assistance  and  lobbying  by  non state  actors  (OPP  RTI)  in  engaging  socially  and  economically  mobilized  CBOs.  In  Ghazi  Goth,  intergovernmental  tensions  rooted  in  party  conflicts  have  stalled  efforts  at  extending  service  delivery.  Calls  to  remove  barriers  to  service  extension,  by  engaging  elected  officials  and  obtaining  support  from  upper  tier  state  actors  have  been  ignored.  Instead,  CBOs  and  informal  settlement  residents  have  been  threatened  by  party  officials  should  they  continue  to  make  efforts  through  the  NGO  for  service  delivery  166   

from the KWSB. Nevertheless, slow and steady information sharing by the NGO mobilized CBO with KMC  and KWSB officials continues to push for progress and reinvigorate service delivery line construction and  extension.  In  Dost  Muhammed  Jungar  Goth,  an  economically  mobilized  group  of  informal  settlement  residents  and  traders  approached  the  NGO  for  technical  support  in  engaging  the  KMC  and  KWSB.  Once  equipped  with  the  necessary  technical  assistance,  maps  and  construction  guidance;  the  CBO  became  selfsufficient.  With  minimal  levels  of  lobbying  and  support  the  CBO  was  able  to  establish  water  supply  and sanitation services from the municipality.    Findings  from  Karachi  reveal  the  relationship  between  service  delivery  extensions  and  mobilized  civil  society  actors,  which  pull  an  otherwise  disabled  and  institutionally  weak  lower  tier  utility  into  formal  arrangements for services to informal settlements.

6 Research Findings Â­ Mumbai
The  final  of  my  three  research  chapters  details  findings  from  India's  largest  mega  city,  Mumbai.   I  begin  the  chapter  with  an  overview  of  India's  national  policy  context  and  the  challenges  facing  urban  development.  I  then  summarize  the  events  that  have  influenced  urban  policies  from  the  times  of  Mughal reign to colonial and postcolonial rule. I then outline the condition of key municipal institutions  in  Mumbai,  in  light  of  growing  responsibilities  and  a  swelling  urban  population.  Research  findings  from  the  water  and  sanitation  service  delivery  context  are  then  grouped  by  comparator  variable.  The  influence  of  these  variables  on  service  delivery  are  then  illustrated  through  case  studies  that  profile  the  role  of  state  and  nonstate  actors  in  two  of  Mumbai's  informal  settlements.  Let  us  now  turn  to  the  salient points of the national context within which Mumbai has grown.   

6.1 Country and Municipal Overview
India's  independence  from  colonial  rule  was  accompanied  by  a  rapid  rate  of  urbanization  which  has  outpaced  state  policy  and  program  capacity.  The  shift  from  rural  selfsufficiency  to  agricultural  mechanization  has  displaced  many  wage  workers,  swelling  the  ranks  of  informal  sector  labourers  in  nearby  cities  (Bhattacharya,  1988).  Rapid  urbanization  has  led  to  the  highest  per  capita  densities  in  the  world,  outpacing  India's  urban  service  delivery  capacities.  The  growing  number  of  informal  settlements  and  slums  has  increased  the  demand  for  scarce  services  overwhelmed  existing  urban  infrastructure  and  service delivery machinery (Mathur, O.P, 1994; Bhagat, 2011).   Policy  commentators  have  long  pressed  for  substantial  investments  in  municipal  public  service  capacity  and infrastructure (ICRIER, 2011). However, India's state governments retain a disproportionate amount  of  power  at  the  national  and  state  (upper  tiers)  levels,  restricting  flows  to  municipal  (lower  tier)  departments.  This  has  left  little  policy  development  (leave  alone  implementation)  capability  at  the  municipal levels of government (MUH HDC, 2011). National and regional planning bodies have also been  accused  of  not  building  implementation  budgets  in  to  policies  (Nath,  1989).  This  is  a  problem  as  these  large  cities  are  forecasted  to  grow  in  population  size  and  density  in  the  years  ahead.  The  largest  of  India's  mega  cities,  Mumbai  has  seen  its  population  grow  from  7  million  in  1975  to  19  million  by  2007.  Forecasts  estimate  that  its  population  will  reach  26.4  million  by  2025  (Metropolis,  2009).  Service  delivery  scarcity  and  inaccessibility  affects  the  human  development  potential  of  the  informal  sector.  While  the  informal  sector  has  long  absorbed  labor  capacity  from  markets,  the  implications  of  top  down  168   

policy  making  for  Mumbai  will  be  a  lack  of  service  delivery  capacity  for  the  informal  sector  (Mehta,  1985).   The  inability  to  engage  the  informal  sector  has  resulted  in  the  gradual  evolution  of  state  policies  that  engage  nonstate  actors  in  the  extension  of  service  delivery.  In  the  1980s  the  government's  response  to  growing  disenchantment  within  the  lower  classes  was  market  liberalization  and  engagement  of  non state  actors.  The  efforts  of  political,  caste  and  religious  driven  assertions  (which  had  previously  diffused  tensions)  had  lost  any  effect  on  the  public  (Pinto,  M.,  2006).  Liberalization  provided  a  convenient  mechanism  by  which  to  off  load  many  of  the  state  responsibilities  to  the  civil  society  sector.  However,  service  delivery  polarization  has  resulted  from  the  poor  collection  of  revenue  where  the  state  has  maintains service delivery (Keefer and Khemani, 2004).   Nonstate actors grew in number following the 1980s and found recognition within state policy and even  market  led  thinking.    In  the  ninth  plan  of  1997  to  2002,  urban  NGOs  were  recognized  in  policy  documents  as  key  stakeholders  in  service  delivery125.  Unfortunately,  the  problems  of  governance  replicated  and  accusations  of  corruption  and  selfserving  agendas  were  made  against  nonstate  actors.  Nevertheless,  people  centred  development  made  inroads  into  state  government  policies  as  a  result  of  national  policy  changes  (Pinto,  M.,  2006).  Future  plans  continued  to  push,  at  least  in  policy  documents,  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements.  In  the  tenth  plan  (2000),  standards  for  local  government  appeared  that  specified  service  delivery  for  the  urban  poor.  The  eleventh  plan  went  further  by  expanding  various  city  funds,  leveraging  the  JNNURM  and  elaborating  on  the  development  scheme  for  small  and  medium  sized  towns.  A  number  of  governance,  financial  and  management  goals  are  outlined  by  the  JNNURM,  which  has  allowed  policy  elites  to  exert  more  pressure  on  state  governments  to  address  specific  urban  infrastructure  and  service  needs  (Gopakumar,  2012).  However,  the  effect  on  urban  poverty  alleviation  has  yet  to  be  seen.  In  the  meantime,  privatization  based  reforms  continue  to  be  pushed,  which  would  funnel  public  savings  to  the  private  operation  of  service  delivery  machinery

(MQI,  2006).  Let  us  now  turn  to  a  brief  history  of  Mumbai  and  the  events  over  ancient  and  colonial  periods which have led to the current policy context. 

6.2 Historical Overview
Early  records  reveal  that  the  coastal  town  of  Mumbai  started  as  a  Portuguese  trading  post.  Originally  a  group  of  seven  separate  islands,  the  settlement  underwent  land  reclamation  and  eventually  formed  the  island  city.  In  the  earlier  times,  the  town  of  Mumbai  fell  under  Mughal  rule.  During  this  period,  the  Mughal  model  of  administration  was  established  founded  on  a  highly  centralized  concentration  of  revenue  collection,  magisterial  functions  and  military  fortification.  This  pattern  of  rule  underwent  further  change,  with  the  colonization  of  the  subcontinent  and  two  centuries  of  British  rule.  The  commercially  driven  interests  of  the  East  India  Company  revived  the  centralized  model  with  improved  coordination  between  state  actors  and  market  players.  As  domestic  products  were  routed  through  the  city to the empire, Mumbai became the nucleus of British power.  The  1930s  saw  Mumbai's  industrial  activity  increase  with  agricultural  and  textiles  based  trade.  Colonial  urban planning saw a few principles employed which left their mark on the city's administrative context.  Colonial  planning  ensured  the  division  of  the  natives  from  the  ruling  class  in  a  way  that  did  not  disrupt  the  locations  of  power.  Housing  settlements  were  planned  in  such  a  way  that  ensured  that  European  residents  were  well  provided  for  while  the  remainder  of  the  native  populations  was  left  in  squalor.   Sanitation,  roads  and  other  civic  services  were  installed  in  areas  where  British  rulers  and  the  wealthier  natives  resided.  This  contrast  in  settlement  patterns  was  evident  as  late  as  1868,  where  records  show  that  the  poorer  Indian  areas  were  marked  by  dirt  roads,  ridden  with  open  sewage  (Shah,  1997).  Inequality  was  perpetuated  by  the  lack  of  tax  collection  and  redistribution  of  wealth  that  could  have  funded municipal services.     When  political  decentralization  and  de  concentration  of  power  to  local  governments  did  take  place,  it  was  fraught  with  mismanagement  and  ill  intent,  leaving  no  real  impacts  on  development  or  basic  services  to  the  urban  poor  (Chaplin,  S.,  2011).  Although  colonial  rule  has  been  credited  with  the  development  of  a  certain  threshold  of  critical  infrastructure,  planners  did  not  anticipate  the  challenges  that  would  emerge  from  rural  to  urban  migration  and  a  growing  informal  sector.  This  lack  of  concern  and  denial  of  planning  realities  was  mirrored  by  a  lack  of  services  to  informal  settlements,  where  a  substantial proportion of the informal sector resides. This neglect continued until the early 1900s. As the  170   

city  core  became  horribly  congested,  modest  improvements  in  basic  services  were  made.  All  new  areas  of  industrial  development  and  residential  settlements  were  incorporated  into  plans  for  a  `Greater  Bombay'.  During  the  war  years,  the  expansion  of  industry  continued  to  drive  urban  development.  However, despite the 1938 Industrial Housing Commission and 1940 Barlow Report which advocated for  equitable  development  little  was  done  to  reverse  the  polarization  of  the  city  at  the  expense  of  basic  services and habitation.    The  paternalistic  image  of  the  state's  authority  over  society  was  entrenched  during  colonial  rule  (Maheshwari,  1999).  As  the  smaller  colonial  Mumbai  fell  under  the  government  of  a  wealthier,  upper  class  British  elite,  the  bazaars  and  small  town  community  arrangements  of  old  Mumbai  were  levelled  to  make  way  for  the  growing  cities  commercial  and  industrial  interests.  No  major  historical  lineage  was  retained  with  Mumbai's  political  past,  but  its  innovating  entrepreneurs  and  export  led  industry  drove  it  forward.  The  combination  of  declining  town  development  in  Maharashtra  and  the  continued  industrialization  of  Mumbai  led  to  surging  levels  of  growth.  The  changing  structure  of  military  cantonments  and  establishment  of  hill  towns  and  transportation  corridors  also  shaped  the  Maharashtran  urban  landscape,  driving  migration  towards  Mumbai.  The  concentration  of  development  in  colonial  port  cities  was  of  little  policy  concern  to  policy  makers.  Peripheral  settlements  have  multiplied,  leading  to  poor  and  imbalanced  planning  (Phadke,  V.S.,  1990).  As  the  port  city  grew  in  economic  and  trade  importance,  polarization  between  the  well  serviced  military  cantonments  and  the  ad hoc informal settlements continued (Chaplin, S., 2011). The polarization that was now being reflected  by the  modern aspirations  of Mumbai's  elite, were to be  transferred to Indian  administrations following  independence.   

6.2.1

Post-Colonial Institutional Setting

In  1947,  the  British  administrative  system  was  inherited  by  the  Indian  independence  movement.  India's  steel  framework  of  institutional  structures  kept  the  bureaucracy  rooted  in  colonial  administrative  practices  long  after  native  Indians  had  taken  office  (Gopakumar,  G.,  2012;  Maheshwari,  1999).  Unfortunately,  none  of  the  incoming  native  Indian  officers  were  professionally  trained  in  policy  or  program  administration  (Kalia,  2006).  Port  city  officials  had  more  power  and  control  than  any  of  Maharashtra's inland jurisdictions. These shifts in power caused many of Maharashtra's state officials to  reconsider  their  level  of  control  over  the  prominent  municipality  (Kosambi,  M.,  1986).  In  the  1960s,  industrialization continued as the result of textile mills expansion and a booming cotton export industry.  171   

Centralized  power  structures  also  expanded  concurrently  in  Mumbai  well  into  the  postindependence  period126.  Planning  in  the  1970s  retained  top  down  approaches  from  the  postindependence  period  with  centrist  policies  dictating  the  zoning  of  large  cities.  For  instance,  Mumbai's  policies  were  designed  to  encourage  the exile of industries to the suburbs as planners believed that mega transportation projects would save  the  troubled  core.  Subsequent  plans  and  acts  introduced  regulations  on  zoning,  but  by  law  restrictions  were  rarely  followed  and  enquiries  became  the  norm  rather.  As  a  result,  plans  reflected  previous  aspirations and were reduced to challenging the results of execution (Harris, N., 1978).  These plans took  twice as long to approve and sanction and were based on outdated and under estimated housing needs.   Planners  essentially  became  isolated  and  distanced  from  the  deadening  inertia  of  local  governments  which  had  no  clue  on  how  to  implement  the  lofty  targets  set  by  their  upper  tier  counterparts127.   The  policy  development  and  implementation  gap  along  with  privatized  service  delivery  machinery  continues  to mire  effective municipal governance  in large  cities like  Mumbai. Plans became politicized tools rather  than  means  to  ends  (Spoedek,  1983).   In  the  meantime,  industrial  resistance  to  relocation  has  reversed  policy  pressure  on  the  state  government,  which  was  then  directed  to  local  authorities  to  silence  them  (Harris, N., 1978).    From  the  1980s  onward,  Mumbai's  transformation  was  a  byproduct  of  segmentation  and  dualism.  The  manufacturing  and  development  sectors  were  free  to  develop  as  they  saw  fit,  in  an  effort  to  brand  Mumbai  as  a  global  city.    State  efforts  to  sustain  this  vision  superseded  any  agenda  to  address  inequalities  through  policy  reforms  and  formulate  a  comprehensive  urban  plan  (Mahadevia,  D.,  1998).  Industrial  development  continued  at  varying  paces,  as  state  planning  struggled  to  meet  new  demands.  India  experienced  periods  of  strong  economic  growth  during  the  Rajiv  Gandhi  period  and  the  abandonment of social policies held to under the Nehru and Indhira Gandhi administrations. Inequitable

 Historically, state actors were not provided with sufficient capacity building or training when state based models were accepted. In the  decades that followed, South Asians filled the multilateral institutions of Europe and brought economically led development thinking back to  their home countries.  127  Setting high targets might motivate local authorities to find ways to obtain the necessary funds, but the often the effect was the reverse Â­  that the problems are too overwhelming to solve in the first place. 

172   

development  and  other  social  costs  of  the  breakdown  of  the  once  strongly  centralized  Mughal  model  of  administration  were  now  being  felt  (Maheshwari,  1999).  Different  wards  and  zones  of  Mumbai  were  now  witnessing  planning  and  development  beyond  the  narrow  visions  of  upper  tier  departments.  Market  led  growth  and  the  liberated  hand  of  local  development  networks  were  soon  to  witness  the  rise  of the media and services sector.  The  1990s  ushered  in  the  era  of  trade  liberalization  and  a  polarized  Mumbai  witnessed  the  establishment  of  a  new  industrial  and  service  oriented  elite.  The  city's  commercial  film  industry  experienced  a  renaissance  and  related  industries  drew  migrants  from  rural  areas.  The  new  media  savvy  and services oriented middle class was not interested in political or social reform for the benefit of lower  income  segments  of  society  (RamMasad,  2007).  The  1993  conceived  mega  city  project  failed  due  to  limited  funding  and  political  support  from  the  upper  tiers  of  the  state  (Chakraborty,  1996).  The  city's  new  urban  elite  revived  the  `look  towards  Shanghai'  logic  that  was  conceived  by  Mumbai's  private  sector  developers  in  decades  prior.  In  the  meantime,  poverty  grew  across  the  informal  sector.  Some  of  the larger slums such as Dharavi, began to accumulate population  sizes larger than most of India's small  towns.  The  impact  of  neoliberal  market  led  policies  were  continuing  to  be  felt  as  densification  in  cities  increased and regional inequities widened (Shan, 1999).   By the 2000s, six million of Mumbai's twelve million inhabitants were residing in slums. Another one and  a  half  million  were  absorbed  by  the  city  streets,  living  as  pavement  dwellers.  The  human  development  indicators  across  this  group  of  slum  and  pavement  dwellers  have  continued  to  drop,  adding  to  the  collective  call  for  help  from  state  and  society  (Khan  et  al,  2003).  Although  an  aspiring  middle  class  had  chosen  to  neglect  the  growing  segments  of  slum  and  pavement  dwellers,  attention  has  emerged  from  another  sector.  A  thriving  civil  society  had  experienced  tremendous  growth,  extending  services  and  social  support  to  the  fifty  four  percent  of  Mumbai's  marginalized.  The  nonstate  sector  has  developed  a  number  of  locally  designed  models  in  isolation  as  well  as  cooperation  with  lower  tier  state  actors.  Civil  society  analysts  point  to  the  `large  number  of  action  groups  who  have  been  trying  to  educate,  raise  awareness and mobilize otherwise fragmented  marginalized groups of the oppressed poor' as `the most  important  development  in  India  since  the  1960s'  (Dhanagar,  D.N.,  1994).  Unfortunately,  most  nonstate  efforts have taken place independently from lower tier state actors.  Commentators  have  pointed  to  the  constraints  that  centralized  power  structures  have  placed  on  local  government  development.  The  persistence  of  the  constitution  supported  federated  model  has  173   

centralized  power  while  delegating  defined  functions  to  the  state  levels  of  government.  The  Indian  federation  exists  on  the  centres'  terms  with  little  autonomy  given  to  growing  local  governments.  With  mega  cities  depending  on  the  centre  for  reforms,  policy  making  and  implementation  have  become  increasingly  separated.  In  principle,  Indian  civil  service  staff  members  are  deputed  closer  to  the  centre  to  help  with  policy  development  and  implementation  before  going  back  to  their  home  departments.  This  rarely  happens  as  staff  continues  to  look  for  positions  that  closely  orbit  the  centres  of  power.  As  a  result  of  collective  upward  aspirations,  those  managing  projects  rarely  possess  ground  experience128.  Long  held  distrust  of  local  governments  by  higher  tiers  of  government  has  resulted  in  little  more  than  talk of financial decentralization in the wake of continued urban deterioration (Data, 1969).  India's  policy  commentators  point  to  the  overlapping  roles  of  state  and  nonstate  actors,  and  the  need  for  monitoring,  evaluation  and  transparency  (Mukhija,  V.,  2001).  Critics  of  nonstate  involvement  point  to  the  tendency  of  some  NGOs  to  cater  solely  to  the  interests  of  middle  and  upper  income  groups.  The  shift in service delivery activity, critics argue, is creating a double standard of citizenship, where the poor  are  increasingly  marginalized  (Zerah,  MH,  2009).  Others  caution  of  the  increasing  number  of  NGO  actors  in  an  expanding  urban  context  (Desai,  1999).  Social  policy  commentators  express  concerns  that  isolated support for lower income groups will simply result in disparities across poor communities. In the  meantime,  the  state  will  continue  to  withdraw  from  its  responsibilities  to  engage  informal  settlements.  There  are  a  few  NGOs  that  facilitate  water  and  sanitation  as  well  as  solid  waste  collection  to  informal  settlements  (Ghosh  et  al,  2008).  Others  engage  in  slum  rehabilitation  as  well  as  land  negotiations  (Patel  and Sharma, 1998). A dependency on foreign funds undermines financial selfsufficiency, although some  locally designed models are tailored to mixed uses.  

6.2.2

The condition of municipal institutions

Mumbai  is  home  to  several  institutions  that  represent  upper  and  lower  tier  actors.  Many  of  these  departments  share  overlapping  functions  and  mandates.  The  city  government  is  essentially  a  state  within  a  state  and  behaves  as  such  (Pinto,  M.,  2008).    The  city  and  suburban  district  of  Mumbai  is

 For a more thorough examination of the dynamics around the ICS, Mahareshri and Subramaniam provide a thorough discussion. 

174   

managed  by  the  Bombay  Municipal  Corporation  (BMC),  now  known  has  the  Municipal  Corporation  of  Greater  Mumbai  (MCGM).  The  MCGM  is  in  charge  of  public  transport,  health,  education,  water  supply  and  sewage,  slum  improvement  and  electricity  distribution.    The  Corporation  is  headed  by  a  state  appointed  commissioner  and  an  elected  mayor  (PACIDRC,  2012).  Tensions  between  the  MCGM's  appointed  and  elected  officers  have  led  to  divergences  in  political  and  administrative  accountability  across Mumbai's institutions. Another key authority in the city is the Mumbai Municipal Redevelopment  Authority  (MMRDA).  The  Metropolitan  Development  Authority,  an  apex  body  of  the  state  government,  implements  metropolitan  plans  and  development  projects  (such  as  large  water  and  sanitation  infrastructure).  Critics  point  to  the  MMRDA's  politicized  development  agenda  and  lack  of  coordination  with  local  bodies  such  as  the  MCGM  (BannerjeeGuha,  S.,  2002).  However,  such  commentaries  avoid  disaggregating the roles of municipal actors and state authorities (BanerjeeGuha, S., 1992, 2002).   Mumbai's  main  municipal  institutions  are  characterized  by  misalignment,  allegations  of  corruption  and  ineptitude.  The  MCGM  and  MMRDA  are  in  constant  conflict  over  policies,  approvals  and  even  routine  project  implementation.  The  227  member  council  run  MCGM  is  accused  of  corruption  and  mismanagement  (Pinto,  M.,  2008).  In  1998,  the  MCGM  experienced  a  bout  of  mayor  in  council  management,  expected  to  improve  performance,  but  since  then  has  been  managed  as  a  commissioner  system.  Aside  from  150  amendments,  its  structures  and  activities  have  remained  unchanged  since  1888  (Pinto,  M.,  2008).  A  number  of  standing  committees,  formed  by  the  heads  of  different  functional  and  geographic  areas,  struggle  to  check  a  commissioner  and  a  network  of  additional,  deputy  and  ward  commissioners.  Comprehensive  governance  is  nonexistent  and  the  commissioner  really  has  no  elected  counterpart  to  bridge  the  political,  state  and  administrative  wings  (Pinto,  M.,  2008).  Divided  party  loyalties result in the slow pace of intrasector fund disbursement and distribution (Ruet et al, 2002). For  instance,  the  capture  of  the  BMC  by  the  Shiv  Sena,  placing  it  at  odds  with  the  Congress  run  state  government  of  Maharashtra  has  resulted  in  several  delays  in  infrastructure  planning  and  millions  of  dollars of cost over runs, such as the WB funded Mumbai Sewage Disposal Project (Chaplin, 2011). Policy  researchers  point  out  that  unless  a  water  department  is  separated  from  the  BMC,  administering  reform  will be difficult (Ruet et al, 2002).  The  politicization  of  municipal  institutions  by  the  upper  tiers  of  the  state  through  the  ICS  is  selfevident.  As  municipal  governments  are  `beneath'  the  upwardly  aspiring  civil  service,  their  capacities  and  capabilities have been increasingly marginalized as policy making has been exclusive to networks of elite  175   

members  of  the  ICS.  Competition  from  state  and  centrist  departments  also  provides  another  front  of  policy  tension  to  contend  with.  While  large  cities  are  incorporated,  their  actual  power  base  and  policy  making  ability  is  constrained.  Mumbai  was  superseded  in  1984  by  a  strong,  centrist  state  government,  which  created  several  duplicate  departments  and  political  appointments  to  maintain  its  hold  on  Mumbai's  policy  direction.  The  creation  of  single  purpose  agencies  by  the  state  government  has  led  to  several problems for policy making in Mumbai (Maheshwari, 1999).   As  a  result  of  mal  governance,  revenue  collection  and  operational  funding  has  become  complicated  for  the  city.  For  instance,  tax  and  nontax  revenue  substantially  outweigh  the  number  of  grants  and  transfers  paid  to  the  mega  city.  The  MCGM  is  struggling  to  improve  the  percentages  of  property  tax  collection and reduce the number of cases in litigation and dispute (PACIDRC, 2012). In reality however,  Mumbai's  development  has  been  largely  the  function  of  a  corporate  agenda  that  seeks  to  make  it  a  world  class  city  (MQI,  2005).  The  establishment  of  several  committees  to  monitor  the  transformation  of  Mumbai, questions the city's inclusivity, where middle class interests are increasing in the policy agenda  with those of the marginalized being excluded (Ghosh et al, 2008; D'Monte, D., 2005).   Several  other  institutions  also  contribute  to  Mumbai's  complicated  urban  planning  and  management  context.  The  MHADA  and  MSRDC  are  in  charge  of  housing  and  transportation,  on  behalf  of  the  state  government.  Other  subservient  departments  within  the  MCGM  include  the  Mumbai  building  and  repair  and  reconstruction  board,  Mumbai  slum  improvement  board,  Slum  rehabilitation  authority,  Maharashtra  water  and  sewerage  board  and  Mumbai  Police  Department.  In  2005,  81  inspectors  and  4413  police  constables  were  living  in  slums  (Patel,  S.B.,  2005).  All  of  the  organizations  that  report  to  the  state  government  lack  coordinated  policies  and  programs  with  the  MCGM.    The  lack  of  clarity  in  accountability to the public as well as the state government also results in problems for governance such  as sufficient funding and sustainability plans (Pinto, M., 2008).   Mumbai has become a divided city along political and class lines.  The mega city has become a contested  political  arena,  with  the  NCP,  BJP,  Congress  and  Shiv  Sena  all  competing  for  power  over  the  MCGM  (Ghosh  et  al  2009).  The  politicization  of  Mumbai's  responses  to  disasters  has  uncovered  party  motivations.  For  instance,  the  floods  and  riots  of  the  mid  1990s  and  2000s  exposed  the  influence  of  the  Shiv Sena over the MCGM. Despite the `adjustments to governance' claimed by the party's interests, the  divisive  tactics  of  the  Hindu  right  have  been  raised  across  several  media  outlets  (Hansen,  T.B.,  2000).  A  politicized  MCGM  overlooks  a  polarized  city,  with  the  wealthy  in  the  western  suburbs  and  the  working  176   

class  situated  towards  the  eastern  and  north  western  suburbs  (Ghosh  et  al,  2009).  The  evolution  of  a  regulatory state into a predatory state has impacted the informal sector the most (Anjaria, 2006).  Policy  knowledge  is  not  the  issue,  rather  the  neglect  of  the  upper  tiers  of  government  to  organize,  discuss  and  pass  legislation  without  any  thought  of  the  legal  framework  and  selfempowerment  of  cities  (Sivaramakrishnan,  2000).  Commentators  have  pointed  out  that  in  order  for  services  to  work  for  the  informal  sector  more  analysis  is  needed  regarding  intergovernmental  responsibilities  as  well  as  the  involvement of nonstate actors in service delivery (Devarajan and Shan, 2004).   Mumbai  is  typical  of  many  Indian  cities,  in  that  governance  is  centralized  at  the  national  and  state  level  and  little  power  percolates  down  to  the  municipal  level  (Kumar,  2006).  Critics  point  to  the  flaws  of  planning  where  distant  upper  tier  actors  develop  unfeasible  and  unsustainable  policies  that  blatantly  neglect  the  urban  poor  (Harris,  N.,  1984).  The  lack  of  implementation  speaks  to  the  need  for  state  governments  to  empower  municipal  corporations  such  as  Mumbai  (D'Souza,  J.B.,  1991).  In  terms  of  service delivery, Mumbai performs far below municipal comparators in the basic services standard (MGI,  2010). Studies conclude  that based on  current  trends, urban services (water, sanitation and  solid waste)  quality  will  deteriorate  sharply  by  2030  (MGI,  2010).  As  a  result,  there  have  been  several  calls  for  administrative reform, to which I now turn. 

6.2.3

Calls for Political and Administrative Reform

Mumbai's  outdated  political  acts  and  administrative  structures  have  drawn  calls  for  reform,  ranging  from increasing levels of intergovernmental cooperation and municipal autonomy to fully privatizing key  services.  One  suggestion  is  to  blend  MMRDA  and  MCGM  committees  in  order  to  streamline  the  implementation  of  planning  initiatives  (Pinto,  M.,  2008;  Ruet,  J.  et  al,  2009).  While  devolving  decision  making  from  the  upper  tier  will  face  resistance,  planning  commentators  counter  that  shared  decision  making  will  address  the  lack  of  performance  by  the  upper  tier  MMRDA  (Phatak  and  Patel,  2005).  Another  suggestion  has  been  to  demarcate  responsibilities  of  the  MCGM,  thereby  implementing  the 

177   

devolution  of  power  as  per  state  government  initiatives129  (Phatak  and  Patel,  2005).  Clarifying  MCGM  responsibilities  with  dedicated  departments  and  elected  councils  would  arguably  improve  service  delivery  by  making  performance  accountable  to  the  people  (Phatak  and  Patel,  2005).  Regardless  of  the  structure,  the  creation  of  a  metropolitan  government  that  is  accountable  to  Mumbaikers  is  central  to  most recommendations.  Nonstate  actors  have  increased  in  their  operation  across  Mumbai,  with  mixed  results  and  responses  from urban activists. A  number of nonstate actors have responded to state shortfalls in service delivery  (Pinto,  M.,  2008).  Mumbai's  NGOs  have  also  increased  advocacy  efforts  with  increasing  migrant  labor  populations.  The  citizen  group,  Save  Bombay  Committee  (SBC)  has  worked  to  counter  and  challenge  development with some success (Mehta, K., 1985). Many of the developments have been funded by the  central  and  state  government,  oddly  enough,  and  the  SBC  has  fought  indirectly  for  upper  tier  recognition  of  municipal  zoning  and  development  bylaws.  The  Bombay  Environmental  Action  Group  (BEAG)  has  performed  a  similar  function  in  fighting  development  beyond  the  capacity  of  the  municipality  (Chaini,  S.,  1985).  In  many  cases,  they  have  argued  and  fought  alongside  press  against  politicians  with  developers  backing,  for  rules  set  by  the  BMC,  BMRDA  and  other  municipally  based  bodies  (Chaini,  S.,  1985).  Critics  argue  that  people  centered  development  requires  coordination  and  evaluation,  where  several  actors  engage  the  state  across  different  contexts  (Pinto,  M.,  2006).  According  to  evidence  by  Nainan  and  Baud,  the  abilities  of  nonstate  actors  have  decreased  from  state  engagement  down  to  the  city  and  neighborhood  and  wards  levels.  As  NGOs  and  CBOs  are  elected  to  ward  committees,  there  may  be  evidence  of  their  representation  of  the  needs  of  the  poor  for  service  delivery  changes  at  that  level.  The  complexity  of  state  and  nonstate  relations  across  the  densely  populated  landscape  of  Mumbai  highlights  the  importance  of  state  and  nonstate  engagement  to  facilitate  and  extend  service  delivery  to  the  informal  sector.  I  now  turn  to  the  water  and  sanitation

 These initiatives should include the slum rehabilitation authority scheme (1995), changes in FSI for redevelopment of cessed buildings (1999)  and alterations in DCR regarding redevelopment of textile mills (2001). Article 243S indicates that ward committees in larger cities should  experience the devolution of powers and functions. In Mumbai, the 16 ward committees have not been constituted nor have they received  discernible functions.

service  delivery  context  to  obtain  a  better  understanding  of  the  relationships  between  upper  and  lower  tier actors in engaging the informal sector. 

6.3 Water and Sanitation Context
Mumbai's  water  and  sanitation  service  delivery  context  illustrates  the  complexities  of  extending  service  delivery  to  a  polarized  city.  A  network  of  elite  interests  has  captured  resources  that  would  otherwise  be  reinvested  into  sustaining  the  city's  deteriorating  infrastructure.  In  the  absence  of  dedicated  funds  for  service  extension,  a  growing  number  of  dense,  low  income  communities  struggle  with  access.  For  instance,  the  MCGM  supplies  enough  water  to  meet  the  basic  needs  of  all  of  Mumbai's  residents,  from  the  wealthy  neighborhoods  of  `Bel  India'  to  the  slums  of  Dharavi.  Unfortunately  the  city  suffers  from  severe  inequities  in  distribution130.  Although  piped  water  is  availability  to  ninety  two  percent  of  the  city's  households,  the  number  of  connections  per  capita  is  substantially  lower  in  slums.  This  gap  in  service  is  in  spite  of  the  large  number  of  stand  posts,  mixed  and  communal  water  points  scattered  throughout  low  income  communities  (YUVA  and  Montgomery  Watson  Consultants,  India,  2001  in  PAC IDRC,  2012).  Furthermore,  sufficient  water  pressure  is  available  for  a  few  hours  during  certain  times  of  the  day.    Slum  dwellers  must  collect  water  during  these  times  to  avoid  scarcity  and  meet  their  household  needs.  To  date,  slum  dwellers  account  for  almost  57.7  percent  of  the  city's  population  continue  to  experience  poor  access  to  water  and  sanitation  facilities  (PACIDRC,  2012).  Per  capita  expenditures on water and sewage by the MCGM have fluctuated in recent years, reflecting attempts to  mitigate differences in access to water and sewage service.    Mumbai  has  a  twotier  sewerage  system.  Most  slum  dwellings  are  not  connected  to  this  system.  The  MCGM's sewage system services forty two percent  of the city's households. Of Mumbai's 8 million slum  dwellers, nearly fifty percent live in authorised slums with some toilet facility131. Innovative solutions are  still  challenged  by  the  poor  design  and  the  operational  and  maintenance  challenges  of  public  toilets.

 Slums receive less than 90 LPCD and other areas received as high as 300 to 350 LCPD.  Both numbers violate the norm of 135 set by the  national commission on urbanization and the ministry of urban development benchmarks. In fact, the large trunk mains that supply water to  Mumbai's wealthier enclaves run directly through the city's largest slum, Dharavi. The large diameter, steel gauge pipes are not connected to  slum communities and are instead, used as footpaths by slum dwellers.  131  The remaining fifty percent use either public toilets, or practice open defecation. 

179   

Public  sanitation  facilities  are  also  very  few  and  those  that  exist  are  usually  filthy,  broken  down  and  generally  unusable.  Vulnerable  groups,  particularly  women,  indicate  that  it  is  safer  to  defecate  in  the  open  than  to  use  some  public  sanitation  facilities.  Of  the  36,704  public  toilets  that  exist  (101  persons/seat)  12,612  (or  1/3)  are  nonfunctioning.    The  underground  sewerage  system  releases  the  treated  discharge  3.5  km  offshore  into  the  Indian  Ocean.  The  rest  flows  into  a  network  of  open  creeks  and  natural  drains  that  discharge  into  the  sea  (PACIDRC,  2012).  All  sewage  drains  to  the  creek  as  a  septic  flow,  toxic  during  monsoons.  A  regional  climatic  feature  of  Mumbai's  water  and  sanitation  context  is  the  impact  of  the  seasonal  monsoons  on  infrastructure.  Every  year,  the  monsoon  rains  raise  flood  waters  across  the  city,  damaging  underground  and  above  ground  infrastructure.    In  2005,  mass  flooding  claimed  500  lives  in  Mumbai,  with  impacts  on  Mumbai's  policy  and  governance  landscape.  Short  term  solutions  to  monsoon  flooding  have  dominated  the  political  discussions  around  infrastructure,  overshadowing  equitable  service  delivery  to  marginalized  segments  of  society,  including  informal  settlements  (slums).  Let  us  now  turn  to  the  comparator  variables  that  will  assess  in  detail,  the  challenges facing service delivery to Mumbai's water and sanitation end users.  

6.3.1

Political representation

Secondary  research  reveals  that  elected  officials  across  Mumbai  have  shown  little  interest  in  extending  service delivery to informal settlements. The reactions of elected officials range from crisis management  (storm  water)  to  passive  monitoring  (water)  and  sheer  neglect  (wastewater).  The  status  quo,  where  elected  officials  provide  water  in  return  for  votes,  appears  to  be  the  accepted  norm  in  Mumbai  (Bapat  and  Agarwal,  2003).  Furthermore,  state  governments  in  Mumbai  have  not  made  any  regulatory  efforts  in  enforcing  water  quality  or  sewage  discharge  standards  to  curtail  the  activities  of  polluting  industries  (EPW,  1987).  In  fact,  elected  officials  assure  industries  that  applications  for  service  connections  will  be  result  in  24/7  supply  by  the  BMC  and  water  works  offices.  Slum  dweller  access  to  scarce  water  supplies  depends  upon  the  plumber  they  employ  via  the  elected  councillors'  letter  of  endorsement.  A  sophisticated  system  of  patronage  and  engagement  between  councillors,  engineers  and  `slum  lords'  dictates  patterns  of  service  delivery  (Anand,  N.,  2000).  Politicians  are  provided  with  allowances  which  are used to  maintain water based services to  the  poor (Zerah, MH., 2005). As  Gopakumar rightly  points  out,  there  is  ample  evidence  that  points  to  the  designs  of  `strategic  partners'  who  leverage  resources  and common agendas to ensure that the water regime continues to operate (Gopakumar, G., 2012). 

180   

Sanitation  and  storm  water  systems  also  suffer  from  political  deadlocks  and  a  political  economy  of  planning  and  development.  When  the  Shiv  Sena  leadership  was  elected  to  lead  the  BMC  (MCGM),  their  acrimonious  relationship  with  the  Congress  led  state  government  has  led  to  several  delays  in  sanitation  projects,  the  most  obvious  being  the  1979  initiated  WB  funded  Mumbai  Sewage  disposal  (Chaplin,  S.,  2011).  In  the  meantime,  narrowly  defined  development  plans  have  continued  to  push  for  slum  demolition,  rather  than  rehabilitation  (Chapin,  S.,  2011;  IRC,  2008).  While  slum  dwellers  and  their  advocates fight for their rights, poor sanitation persists, leading to the spread of disease. Analysts blame  the  politiciandevelopment  nexus  for  the  current  situation,  as  vacant  land  for  drainage  continues  to  be  sold  off  to  the  highest  bidding  developers  (Prabhu,  2005).  Planning  continues  to  neglect  the  housing  needs  of  the  poor  and  storm  water  channels  are  encroached  upon  by  informal  settlements.  When  the  Mithi River overflows, both the lower and higher income groups suffer from infrastructure failure. Public  anger in the wake of such disasters has done little to disentangle the network of state and private actors  who  benefit  from  the  status  quo.  Many  analysts  argue  that  the  floods  of  2005  and  other  disasters  could  be  averted  if  accountability  were  transferred  from  elected  officials  with  statewide  responsibilities  to  local officers (Phatak and Patel, 2005; Hoskote, R., 2005).  Research by nonstate actors and advocates for the urban poor reveals that the informal sector is left to  struggle  for  habitation  on  marginalized,  flood  prone  land.  The  lack  of  solidarity  among  fragmented  and  isolated  groups  has  perpetuated  the  feeling  of  disempowerment.  Ethnic  and  religious  ties  bind  communities  in  the  absence  of  other  networks.  Commentators  point  out  that  Mumbai  is  being  taken  from  economic  to  political  to  managerial  policy  dictates  as  a  result  of  bad  governance  (Paul,  2011).  The  counter  offered  by  researchers  is  to  establish  good  government  which  is  efficient,  independent,  accountable  and  characterized  by  an  open  public  service  (Leftwich,  1994).  Services  to  the  poor  by  the  providing  state  must  treat  them  as  citizens  and  in  the  case  of  Mumbai,  as  coproducers  of  service  to  informal settlements (WDR, 2004; Ostrom, 1997). I now turn to the condition of municipal public service  actors, in the next comparator variable. 

6.3.2

Administrative accountability/transparency

Secondary  research  reveals  little  evidence  of  accountability  or  transparency  in  Mumbai's  water  and  sanitation  departments.  Accountability  mechanisms  and  procedural  transparency  has  not  evolved  since  colonial  times  and  polarized  service  delivery  has  persisted  (Zerah,  MH.,  2005).  Service  delivery  extension  has  been  the  result  of  development  catered  towards  connections  for  the  middle  and  upper  181   

class and not the poor. As localized tax bases (rather than broader development funds) underpin service  delivery,  no  links  between  water  and  sanitation  have  been  made  (Zerah,  MH.,  2005).  The  only  accountability  framework  resides  with  ALMs  and  other  more  neighbourhood  and  ward  level  offices,  which are familiar with local and sub local needs (Chaplin, S., 2011).   The  Department  of  Sewerage  Operations  of  the  Municipal  Corporation  of  Greater  Mumbai  (MCGM)  is  responsible  for  the  collection,  conveyance  and  disposal  of  sewage/waste  water  generated  in  the  residential,  commercial  and  industrial  premises  in  Mumbai.  MCGM  collected  tariffs  amounting  to  Rs.  4.56  billion  in  200304  with  an  expenditure  of  about  Rs.  3.0  billion  on  operations,  making  a  net  operational  income  of  Rs.  1.56  billion.  Commentators  have  questioned  why  more  money  was  not  invested  in  infrastructure  and  maintaining  a  state  of  good  repair,  as  Mumbai's  drainage  and  sewage  pipes  are  over  100  years  old.   Where  they  run  in  parallel,  leakages  in  sewage  contaminate  water  lines.  Small  diameter  lines  are  clogged  with  solid  waste  and  silt.    The  informal  and  unplanned  expansion  challenges  replacement.   The  collection  and  disposal  of  waste  water  and  sewage  in  Mumbai  is  divided  into  seven  zones,  from  which  sewage  and  waste  water  is  collected  and  drawn  marine  outfalls,  some  three kilometres into the sea. There are 53 pumping stations for pumping the sewage/waste water from  lower level to higher level and there are 54,000 manholes for maintenance of 1,400 km long network of  the sewerage system.  The  equitable  supply  of  water  has  been  challenged  on  many  fronts.  Upper  tier  technocrats  emerged  as  powerful  forces  that  shaped  postcolonial  Mumbai  and  ensured  services  to  formal  settlements  in  line  with  development  plans.  Studies  reveal  that  technocrats  were  interested  in  retaining  state  government  authority  over  services,  rather  than  actually  improving  service  delivery  (Anand,  2009).  In  the  absence  of  an autonomous utility, water and sanitation projects  have been given a low priority by both state actors  and  donors  (Phatak  and  Patel,  2005).  While  the  MCGM  believes  that  water  supply  will  be  ample,  critics  from  organizations  such  as  the  Tata  institute  for  social  sciences  point  to  a  twenty  six  percent  shortfall  (Menon,  M.,  2006).  Little  thought  has  been  given  to  engaging  informal  settlements  that  lack  access  to  official  service  connections.  While  the  average  flat  consumes  200  liters  per  day,  slum  households  struggle  with  80  to  130  liters  per  day  (Menon,  M.,  2006).  Where  supply  is  intermittent,  the  social  mobilization  of  the  poor  to  access  service  only  elevates  the  power  and  authority  of  the  political development nexus who then release water to the poor and wealthy (Anand, N., 2000). 

182   

Sanitation  has  also  suffered  from  challenges  in  breaking  the  status  quo  of  patronage  and  votes  for  services. For instance, the  WB funded `Slum  Sanitation Program' (SSP) was fraught with implementation  challenges.  Although  the  initial  concept  was  based  on  a  shared  approach,  it  was  difficult  to  get  communities  to  participate  who  had  already  experienced  some  upgrading  and  who  were  used  to  obtaining  `services  for  votes'.  Even  though  the  program  was  launched  through  the  MCGM  with  reputable  NGOs,  poor  management  and  cooption  by  local  actors,  has  led  to  mixed  results.  The  political,  business  and  personal  agendas  of  powerful  local  actors  have  often  trumped  community  needs.  The  weak  respond  with  an  interest  in  obtaining  household  connections  to  the  sanitation  system  (Chaplin,  S.,  2011).  Some  toilet  blocks  were  used  as  dumps  and  others  fell  into  disrepair  in  the  absence  of  sustainment  plans.  Other  blocks  of  toilets  have  been  insufficient  for  the  local  population.  For  example,  the BMC built 40 toilet blocks in Kamla Nagar for 80,000 families (Chaplin, S., 2011).   It  appears  that  the  extension  of  water  and  sanitation  services  is  largely  a  function  of  catering  to  elite  interests.  The  poor  will  only  benefit  from  local  design  and  ownership.  The  political  economy  of  water  supply  is  unlikely  to  cease  until  a  dedicated  department  takes  ownership  of  resource  management.  On  the  sanitation  side,  the  NMMRA  is  the  first  large  scale  toilet  block  plan  that  seeks  to  extend  service  outside  of  patronage  politics.  Several  NGOs  such  as  SPARC  are  in  the  mix  and  will  likely  be  involved  in  the operations and maintenance of these blocks following construction (Chaplin, S., 2011). Nevertheless,  local  ownership  of  service  delivery  will  require  some  level  of  facilitation  by  a  lower  tier  actor  (beyond  state department support) if service delivery is to be sustainable. 

6.3.3

Intergovernmental support and policy failures

Secondary  research  reveals  that  intergovernmental  support  for  Mumbai's  water  and  sanitation  sector  is  disabling  on  a  number  of  fronts.  First,  policy  research  points  to  the  debilitating  policy  environment  and  the  need  for  an  autonomous,  standalone  department  to  manage  Mumbai's  water  and  sanitation  responsibilities.  Research  on  Mumbai's  planning  and  management  regime  reveals  the  need  for  more  intergovernmental  communication  (City  Alliance,  2008).  Second,  severe  flooding  events  reveal  that  the  current  levels  of  infrastructure  are  not  enough  to  meet  the  needs  of  population  growth  and  climate  change.   Mumbai's inefficient and ineffective governance environment has been the target of policy research and  program  analysis  beyond  water  and  sanitation.  The  authority  to  make  decisions  at  the  city  level  is  183   

retained  at  the  state  level,  where  state  priorities,  political  agendas  and  bureaucratic  inefficiencies  undermine  coordinated  planning  and  municipal  needs  (Sharma,  K.,  2003;  Pinto,  M.,  2008).  For  example,  upper  tier  state  actors  resist  interstate  water  sharing  with  Mumbai,  for  fear  of  experiencing  shortages.  NGO actors point out that despite the state governmental subsidizing 70 percent of the cost of the toilet  blocks,  most  slum  dwellers  still  struggle  with  access  (Patel  et  al,  2007).   This  supports  the  finding  that  lower tier actors who lack professional training are unable to negotiate with upper tier actors during the  design  phases  of  these  blocks  (WB,  2011).  Furthermore,  the  State  government  does  not  implement  or  enforce  licensed  standards  that  have  been  established  by  the  MCGM  (EPW,  1987).  Similarly,  state  government  defined  sanitation  performance  targets  are  not  supported  by  upper  tier  policies.  When  slum  management  was  uploaded  to  the  state  and  central  governments,  slum  upgrading  discussions  (which  involve  municipal  services)  were  neglected  as  policies  and  initiatives  were  repackaged  for  political  purposes  (Sivaramarakrishnan,  2000).  The  2005  Jawarlal  Nehru  Urban  Revitalization  Movement  (JNNURM)  and  other  upper  tier  led  initiatives  focus  on  large  infrastructure  development  projects.  Progress  at  the  city  levels,  indicative  of  poor  statecity  coordination,  is  limited  (WB,  2012;  Sivaramarakrishnan, 2009). Researchers point to the ongoing struggle between state and national elites,  which  is  at  the  root  of  municipal  policy  problems  (Harvey,  2001).  NGOs  active  in  the  field  of  sanitation  point  to  gains  in  relationship  building  with  local  government  actors,  but  avoid  engaging  the  upper  tier  state  actors  given  the  lack  of  policy  traction  and  will  to  implement.  In  the  meantime,  Mumbai's  core  municipal service delivery functions and poverty alleviation programs remain unfulfilled.   The concentration of planning and implementation power at the upper tiers results in uninformed policy  making  and  poor  implementation.  The  implications  of  the  centralized  model  for  Mumbai's  planning  and  urban projects, is additional review, approvals and revisions, which are often the cause for delays (Pinto,  M.,  2008).  The  management  of  such  programs  by  departments  housed  in  ministries  in  Delhi  rather  than  representing  local  needs  and  concerns  in  Mumbai  is  a  challenge  for  effective  and  efficient  city  management  (i.e.  slum  protection  and  resettlement  policies  should  be  in  the  MCGM  rather  than  the  Ministry  of  Housing)  (Sharamayakrishnan,  2004).  Furthermore,  coordination  between  and  across  state  and  municipal  actors  is  nonexistent  (Wisner,  2000).  There  is  no  oversight  or  support  for  service  delivery  providers in different city districts. Engineering efforts within the postcolonial administration are caught  between an unmapped legacy, political service requests/patronage and waived bills that result in ad hoc  services  to  the  poor,  appropriation  by  the  middle  class  and  the  erosion  of  any  efforts  to  galvanize  and  sustain  a  master  plan  (Anand,  N.,  2009).  Municipal  functionaries  guide  political  and  consumer  184   

stakeholders  around  the  rules  when  they  are  too  restrictive.  The  result  is  erosion  of  the  system,  but  meeting short term demands.    The  2005  floods  in  Mumbai  brought  the  intergovernmental  disarray  into  full  public  view.  A  review  by  local  researchers  reveals  that  upper  tiers  of  the  state  governments  hold  the  power  to  create  acts,  policies  and  procedures  that  are  cumbersome  and  onerous  for  lower  tiers  of  the  state  to  follow  in  making  necessary  policy  changes    (Phatak  and  Patel,  2005;  Pachauri,  2005).  A  review  by  EPW  researchers  reveals  a  policy  disconnect  between  upper  and  lower  tiers  of  the  state  that  dates  back  to  colonial  era  policy  development  behaviour.  On  the  one  hand,  the  state  government  holds  the  authority  for  physical  and  land  use  planning  for  metropolitan  regions  including  Mumbai.  The  Municipal  Disaster  Plan  (DP)  requires  the  MCGM  to  declare  boundaries,  survey  and  map  land  uses  through  public  engagement.  However,  when  the  MCGM  submitted  a  draft  after  3  years  of  development,  it  took  another  13  years  for  it  to  be  approved  (EPW,  1987).  Furthermore,  the  final  draft  did  not  take  into  account  storm  drainage  capacities,  water  distribution  or  sewage  collection  networks,  as  the  state  government  was  only  interested  in  land  use  zoning  and  real  estate  market  indicators  (Phatak  and  Patel,  2005).   The flood also revealed the disastrous environmental impacts of market led development and the policy  paralysis of Neoliberal priorities. A combination of stripped river front mangroves (lack of environmental  regulation),  choking  flows  of  waste  (eroded  regard  for  solid  waste  and  sewage/storm  water  management),  encroachment  by  illegal  development  (land  real  estate  market  disregard  for  environmental  or  state  land  zoning  and  bylaws)  all  exposed  municipal  mismanagement  and  market  greed  (Hariyale  and  Thane,  2006).  The  search  for  an  accountable  body  revealed  how  hemmed  in  Mumbai's  administration  had  become  to  operating  on  command  and  control  based  assumptions  Â­  based  in  1970s  environmental  contexts  (Hoskote,  R.,  2005).  A  study  was  soon  commissioned  to  study  the  floods  and  prevent  a  recurrence.  The  policy  implications  of  the  study's  recommendations  are  arguably  beyond  the  capability  of  the  current  governance  framework.  Namely,  creating  an  urban  hydrology  authority  that  oversees  the  construction  of  storm  water  pumping  stations,  widening  the  river  and  resolving  disputes  between  the  airport  authority  and  all  other  state  actors  with  construction  based  activities;  is  accused  of  being  naÃ¯ve.  The  largely  engineering  based  solutions  ignore  socio  economic  challenges  and  political  issues  of  intergovernmental  power  and  control.  The  pace  of  neoliberal  development is also beyond critique, leave alone policy reform.    185   

Severe  flooding  events  have  also  revealed  disparities  between  rich  and  poor.  Slums  were  the  most  affected  in  terms  of  property  damage  and  disease  outbreaks  (Bavadam,  2005).  Although  lower  income  groups were among the most affected, many blame the paving over of Mumbai and the lack of sufficient  drainage  for  the  deluge  (Katakam  et  al,  2005).  Poor  slum  dwellers  are  often  the  last  to  receive  support  from  the  government.  Of  the  slums  that  did  receive  state  support,  few  witnessed  an  ongoing  state  presence.   Instead,  relief  efforts  and  implementation  were  left  to  independent  nonstate  actors  already  engaged  in  the  slums.  The  result  has  been  discontinuous  relief  and  support.  For  instance,  although  the  Sulabh  International  `twin  flush  toilet'  sanitation  program  led  to  improved  outcomes  through  CBO  engagement,  its  implementation  took  longer  across  state  departments  which  lacked  intergovernmental  communication  (ADB,  2011).  The  state  seems  to  take  an  approach  of  helping  the  informal  sector  just  enough  to  pacify  them  before  leaving  so  that  they  cannot  rebuild  on  the  land  they  were  occupying  (Bavadam,  2005).  So,  while  a  gap  between  state  and  city  (upper  and  lower  tier  actors)  exists,  another  gap between lower tier actors (state and nonstate) also requires analysis. 

6.3.4

Citizen engagement or pro-poor engagement

Policy  and  program  research  reveals  a  polarized  environment  of  citizen  engagement  in  Mumbai.  Although  upper  tier  actors  insist  that  services  are  equally  distributed  to  all  of  Mumbai's  residents,  it  is  the wealthier communities that are engaged by the state. Nonstate actors are indirectly deferred to for  the  provision  of  services  to  informal  settlements.  For  instance,  upper  tier  actors  point  to  the  pro  poor  sections  of  national  and  state  government  formulated  policies.  Although  the  state  level  Maharashtra  Housing  and  Area  Development  Authority  is  responsible  for  toilet  blocks,  it  is  unable  to  design  or  construct  the  appropriate  infrastructure  (Zerah,  MH.,  2005).  Critical  policy  research  also  reveals  that  state  legislators  have  been  unable  to  address  the  lack  of  water  supply  to  slums.  The  MCGM's  hydraulic  department  is  in  charge  of  water  supply  and  sewage.  Although  it  is  organized  hierarchically  at  the  ward  level, it possesses insufficient authority to address the power structures that are embedded in Mumbai's  slums.  Furthermore,  while  nonstate  actors  are  able  to  engage  informal  settlements,  they  are  unable  to  ensure supply once connections are established. As a result, shortages in water supply continue to exact  a  toll  on  lower  income  groups  in  society  (Cooper,  2011).  Paradoxically,  low  lying  urban  areas  that  are  inundated with flood water continue to struggle with water scarcity (Angweleter, 2005).   Many  policy  researchers  have  pointed  out  that  citizen  engagement  has  been  appropriated  by  influential  groups and individuals across Mumbai's various districts and wards. For example, neighbourhood groups  186   

(ALMs)  across  Mumbai  work  closely  with  elected  officials  at  the  ward  level  to  resolve  service  delivery  issues. The activism of these middle income groups ensures the steady supply  of water along with other  services, to their communities (Gandy, M., 2008). In an effort to guard against potential shortages, these  groups  have  been  observed  to  pressure  state  actors  to  restrict  services  to  slum  communities  (DSK,  2013).  The  manipulation  of  services  is  not  only  restricted  to  neighbourhood  groups.  Political  negotiations  in  the  microspheres  of  Mumbai  reveals  how  community  leaders  obtain  services  for  their  constituents only to compromise it (Gandy, M., 2008). Some slum lords have been observed to apply for  service  connections  under  the  guise  of  a  CBO,  only  to  turn  it  into  a  business  operation  or  private  use.  Critics  have  cautioned  that  nonstate  actors  that  are  engaging  the  state  on  behalf  of  lower  income  groups  are  not  always  interested  in  the  betterment  of  the  poor  and  need  to  be  clear  in  the  representation of interests (Srinivasan, 1980).   Pro  poor  engagement  or  citizen  engagement  is  increasing  in  breadth  as  the  city  realizes  that  it  cannot  engage  all  stakeholders.  Volunteer  groups  such  as  AGNI  are  trying  to  get  people  of  various  wards  to  demand  that  consultants  are  not  hired  and  that  residents  are  engaged  in  participatory  decision  making.  Some  of  them  argue  that  as  MCGM  claims  that  ninety  percent  of  bills  are  collected,  the  issue  should  be  to reduce wastage and plug leaks. Lobbyists within this segment of civil society argue that based on such  MCGM  reports,  privatization  should  not  even  enter  the  equation  (Menon,  M.,  2006).  Some  NGOs  engage the system on behalf of slums, but the sustainment comes from political attention and advocacy,  as  the  Alliance  (SPARC,  National  Slum  Dwellers  Alliance  and  Mahila  Milan)  are  doing.  The  simultaneous  resistance  to  and  engagement  of  the  state  illustrates  how  contested  urban  spaces  include  the  struggle  for service delivery to the informal sector (McFarlane, 2008).  

6.3.5

Donor/Civil society activity

Secondary  research  reveals  the  prominent  role  of  donor  and  civil  society  actors  in  the  extension  of  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements.  In  Mumbai,  state  actors  are  increasingly  cooperating  with  donor  and  NGO  actors  to  improve  the  conditions  of  sanitation  in  slums.  Mumbai  has  witnessed  the  highest  number  of  instances  of  state  and  nonstate  cooperation  for  sanitation  solutions,  reflecting  the  resurgence  of  capital  and  businesses,  receptive  to  civil  society  supported,  ground  up  solutions  (Chaplin,  S.,  2011).  Although  success  has  been  experienced  through  state  and  nonstate  cooperation,  challenges  remain  to  scaling  up  solutions  through  capital  intensive  funding  or  replicating  locally  designed  solutions  through increased community engagement.  187   

Civil  society  supported  sanitation  models  have  gained  acceptance  due  to  their  focus  on  local  design  and  sustainability. These models have also been able  to side step  the power structures that surround `public  assets'  such  as  community  toilet  blocks.  Sulabh  International's  (SI)  design  and  development  of  `stand alone'  composting  toilets  for  low  income  communities  and  slums  is  world  renowned  (WSP,  2004).  Part  of its success has been the requisite education for uptake, which has been too slow for `top down', mass  produced  solutions  (CWAP,  2011).  The  SI  solution  has  been  remodeled  by  other  NGOs  into  twin  flush  toilets  blocks,  pay  as  you  go  and  free  (UNDP,  2011).  Most  recently,  SPARC  bid  on  and  won  an  SSP  proposal  to  construct  320  toilet  blocks  in  Mumbai,  causing  the  government  to  change  bid  processes  to  allow  NGOs  to  compete  with  for  profit  contractors  (Chaplin,  S.,  2012).  SPARC  work  on  community  designed blocks has proven to MCGM staff the value of CBO engagement and design (Burra et al, 2003).  Some  challenges  with  how  they  are  managed  and  contractors  and  businesses  using  them  more  as  a  profit  taking  rather  than  for  community  service.  SPARC  success  has  shown  that  transparency  of  implementation  is  critical  to  success  (Sharma  and  Bhure,  2005).  A  lack  of  transparency  and  cooperation  led  to  the  failure  of  the  1979  Mumbai  Sewage  disposal  project,  which  say  disagreement  between  the  WB, contractor and the BMC, resulting in wasted money and cost over runs (Chaplin, S., 2012).  Donor  agencies,  frustrated  with  the  lack  of  congruency  between  state  actors,  have  also  called  for  more  efforts  towards  local  government  autonomy,  with  performance  measurement  and  management  measures. Internal reforms, they argue, are required for improved service delivery before any discussion  of  privatization.  Recent  discussions  among  nonstate  actors  suggest  that  `Performance  based  contracts',  whether they are private or public governed, may serve as a solution to the PPP debate (WB, 2014). Civil  society  initiatives  suggest  more  enabling  factors  for  local  level  initiatives  in  collaboration  with  the  poor,  which  is  aligned  with  the  suite  of  solutions  based  on  what  is  pro  poor,  homogenous  and  easily  monitored (Devarajan and Shah, 2004).  NGOs such as YUVA and Toxics Link have engaged the MCGM to encourage and instill the environmental  status  of  slums  and  citizens'  rights  into  the  city's  operations  (YUVA,  1999).  YUVA  and  SPARC  are  also  engaged  in  a  lot  of  stand  post  water  work,  extending  some  level  of  water  supply  to  slum  communities  (Ruet,  2002).  Unfortunately,  much  of  their  efforts  have  been  steamrolled  by  development  projects  and  the  continuous  threats  of  evictions.  Nevertheless,  citizen  action  and  community  organization  has  buttressed  efforts  through  the  MCGM  to  raise  environmental  concerns  on  a  broader,  urban  scale  that  cuts  across  class  lines.  As  far  as  the  fringes  of  Mumbai  `water  scarce'  communities  are  concerned,  a  188   

number  of  actors  continue  to  engage  in  petty  politics  to  supply  water  to  poor  communicates  (Contractor, 2012). 

6.4 Case Studies
I  now  turn  to  two  case  studies  in  Mumbai  that  illustrate  the  tensions  between  upper  and  lower  tier  actors  in  extending  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements.  As  I  was  not  able  to  visit  the  two  profiled  communities in Mumbai due to travel restrictions, I have triangulated the evidence provided by the non state actors (NGO and CBO) with analysis and commentary on the state of sanitation efforts in Mumbai's  informal settlements from academic and policy research. 

6.4.1

The Case of Dadar TT: A Successful Outcome

Since  the  1960s,  Sulabh  International  has  been  advocating  for  and  spreading  the  simplicity  of  the  twin  flush  toilet  to  poor  communities  across  India  where  water  and  sanitation  services  are  nonexistent.  The  use  of  the  composting  twin  flush  toilet  has  liberated  lower  caste  `untouchable'  females  from  tending  to  latrines  and  carrying  away  `night  soil'  by  hand  across  countless  slums.  The  Dr.  Pathak  invented  "twinpit  pourflush  toilet"  is  capable  of  standalone  solutions  or  connections  with  a  municipal  sewage  system.  Starting  in  Bihar  in  the  early1970s,  the  model  has  been  replicated  by  several  NGOs  across  India  and  beyond.   In  Mumbai,  the  Sulabh  model  has  been  implemented  most  recently  by  SPARC.   The  successes  and  failures  of  various  applications  of  the  Sulabh  model  across  the  city  and  country  (pay  per  use,  subsidized,  free  of  cost)  has  generated  critical  development  discussions  with  respect  to  the  state  and  nonstate provision of sanitation services. 

6.4.1.1 Background
In  1988,  the  first  `Sulabh  Shouchalaya'  was  constructed  in  Mumbai  at  Dadar  TT  near  the  Asiad  Bus  Stand.  Despite  a  reliance  on  donor  funds  for  the  initial  capital  construction,  the  toilet  block  was  able  to  pay  for  itself  within  several  months  of  operation.  High  levels  of  commuter  bus  stand  traffic  provided  a  steady  and  consistent  flow  of  pay  per  use  customers.  This  generated  sufficient  revenues  for  operations  and maintenance as well as loan repayments on the initial construction costs.  The  success  of  subsequent  SI  implementations  has  been  linked  to  higher  commuter  and  pedestrian  traffic.  Deployment  at  train  stations,  bus  stations  and  city  junctions  results  in  their  heavy  use  and  considerable  daily  revenue  by  those  who  can  afford  it.  It  is  estimated  that  Sulabh  and  the  sponsoring  189   

organization  are  consistently  able  to  cover  their  construction  costs  in  less  than  a  year.    The  surplus  can  then  crosssubsidise  toilets  built  in  slums  where  residents  are  unable  to  pay  for  infrequent  usage.  The  project's  success  has  resulted  in  Sulabh  constructing  309  public  sanitary  blocks  all  over  Mumbai.  Out  of  309  public  toilet  blocks,  243  are  funded  by  MCGM  while  various  donors  have  funded  the  balance.  Similar  to  the  pilot  at  Dadar  TT,  Sulabh  maintains  these  toilet  blocks  through  charges  collected  from  the  users. Of these 309, nearly 200 are in the slum areas while 100 odd are in commercial areas. The charge  in  commercial  areas  is  Rs  2  per  person.  Slumdwelling  families  are  issued  monthly  passes  for  Rs  10  only.  This slum subsidy is met through collections in the commercial area at Rs 2 per person.  In  situations  where  the  private  sector  has  been  contracted  to  design,  build  and  operate  public  toilets,  the  outcomes  have  been  mixed.  In  these  situations,  operating  models  have  departed  from  site  specific  pay  per  use  designs  pioneered  at  Dadar  TT.  In  1997,  the  Maharashtra  Government  issued  a  contract  for  providing public  toilets in  urban areas for which a HUDCO loan as well as a Government of India subsidy  at  Rs  350  per  person  were  provided  for  a  twoyear  period.  Based  on  this,  Sulabh  International  in  collaboration  with  Solid  Waste  Department  of  the  MCGM  prepared  a  project  for  767  toilet  blocks.  The  cost  of  660  million  was  divided  between  the  Central  and  State  Government  as  well  as  a  HUDCO  loan.  Although  SI  pursued  the  work  with  the  help  of  upper  tier  state  officials  (MR  Shah),  the  project  launch  was  delayed  for  three  years132.  This  experience  highlights  the  vested  interests  that  are  drawn  to  capital  intensive  infrastructure  projects  in  Mumbai.  Civic  staff  asks  for  a  "price"  for  giving  the  clearances;  Contractors  build  inferior  structures  calculating  the  bribes  to  vested  interests  as  part  of  their  `project  costs'.  It  is  this  lobby  of  politicians,  contractors,  slumlords  and  civic  staff  that  is  against  `right'  solutions,  as their channel of making money stops.  In  other  municipalities,  similar  outcomes  have  been  documented  where  contracting  out  to  the  private  sector  was  accompanied  by  subsidization  and  the  granting  of  free  space  by  the  municipality.  Over  time,  as  profits  fell,  operators  lost  interest  in  running  the  toilets.    With  no  incentives  for  upkeep,  little  was                                                                    
132

 In 2000, the Government had provided funding for only two years. When this GR was brought to the notice of the then Municipal  Commissioner of Thane, T Chandrashekhar, he immediately acted upon the information and some 65 Sulabh Shouchalayas were constructed in  Thane.  

190   

invested in keeping the toilets clean and in a state of good repair. Third party inspections are absent and  as  a  result,  dozens  of  such  toilet  blocks  are  now  virtually  unusable.  The  Corporation  has  tried  to  hand  over  operations  and  maintenance  to  private  companies  again.    Communal  slum  facilities,  built  by  municipalities  are  entirely  without  subsidization.   The  ratio  of  people  to  toilets  in  many  slums  can  be  as  high  as  1:2,500  per  toilet  seat.  User  charges  in  slum  toilets    Rs  20  per  family  per  month    are  insufficient  to  generate  adequate  revenue  to  cover  operations  and  maintenance.  Hence,  here,  either  a  crosssubsidy or a direct subsidy is unavoidable. 

6.4.1.2 Intervention
In  cities  like  Mumbai,  municipalities  have  engaged  NGOs  working  with  the  urban  poor  to  design  construct  and  maintain  public  toilets  in  slum  areas.  The  funds  for  these  projects  are  with  the  municipality,  usually  lying  unused.  The  private  part  of  the  partnership  is  therefore  not  in  funds,  but  in  execution. Several NGOs, including Shelter Associates and SPARC (Society for Area Resource Centres) bid  for contracts  to construct toilets. These  groups consulted communities where the toilets would be built,  included  CBO  leadership  in  the  design  and  the  location,  and  encouraged  people  from  the  community  to  be  part  of  the  construction  process.  For  instance,  children  would  continue  to  defecate  in  the  open  even  where  a  toilet  was  available  because  the  toilet  pan  was  too  wide  for  the  child  to  straddle.  As  a  result,  mothers would let  their  children defecate just outside the  toilet  block making the approach  to the  toilet  filthy.  The  NGOCBO  group  would  then  design  a  separate  children's  toilet.  In  some  slums  in  Mumbai,  where  SPARC  undertook  the  work,  a  community  centre  was  built  on  top  of  the  toilet  block.  And  the  caretaker  and  his  family  lived  in  a  room  above  the  block.  Evidence  from  CBOs  and  the  policy  literature  confirm that the results were cleaner and better maintained facilities.  This  case  study  and  the  supporting  examples  highlights  the  differences  between  upper  and  lower  tier  actors  in  service  delivery  extension.    Cooperation  between  lower  tier  state  and  nonstate  actors  has  generated positive outcomes in sanitation block construction and sustainment. The premise has been on  `community  led  development  models'.  However,  research  has  noted  that  once  `scaling  up'  takes  place  through  upper  tier  capital  intensive  projects  and  funding  models,  bribery  is  observed  which  results  in  pay  outs,  inefficiencies  and  project  delays.   Furthermore,  sustainment  concerns  such  as  operations  and  maintenance  expenses  are  neglected  resulting  in  eventual  project  failures.  As  with  the  other  cases,  there  is  no  evidence  of  political  support  by  elected  officials  nor  is  there  substantial  intergovernmental  support  for  lower  tier  activity.    Local  design  driven  by  lower  tier  nonstate  actors,  has  contributed  to  191   

positive  outcomes  in  service  delivery.  Evidence  from  this  case  study  points  to  the  value  of  community  designed `replication', rather than more capital intensive efforts to `scale up'.  

6.4.1.3 NextSteps
There  is  clearly  a  need  to  focus  on  appropriate  management  of  the  toilet  blocks.  Governance  issues  appear  to  be  the  most  challenging  with  such  models.  For  instance,  if  a  municipal  corporation  allows  NGOs  to  bid  for  the  construction  of  toilets,  control  of  the  money  lies  in  the  hands  of  petty  bureaucrats133.   Graft  among  middlemen,  without  monitoring  leads  to  higher  costs  and  is  a  disincentive.   Getting  funds  in  time  to  continue  construction  and  meet  deadlines,  is  a  disincentive  for  NGOs  that  work  at the pace of community capacity.  NGO  approaches  to  facility  management  also  require  analysis,  even  though  the  NGO  will  strive  to  enhance  capacity  and  community  development.  Community  based  contractors  raise  issues  of  inexperience  and  construction  flaws.  Where  a  group  has  been  formed  to  manage  the  toilet,  the  toilets  risk  appropriation  by  a  local  thug  or  moneylender  who  charges  extortion  and  makes  the  toilet  his  adda.  Use of the facility by a caretaker, who then does not have to pay rent, just ensure the facility is clean is a  key element. Use of the block by the community for other purposes (savings), which cross subsidizes the  toilet  block,  is  also  necessary  in  poorer  areas.  Subsidy  of  the  block  by  other  activities,  which  requires  that the operator have some reach into areas with higher traffic.  Despite  the  documented  successes  and  roots  causes  of  failure  in  these  case  studies,  commentators  points  to  the  need  for  more  accountability  and  transparency  in  such  partnerships  to  ensure  service  delivery  to  the  poorest  of  the  poor134.  The  MCGM's  retired  MR  Shah  says  a  link  between  state  agencies  and  civic  authorities  is  required  as  donors  and  authorities  operate  on  different  time  lines.   Intervention  is  needed  as  donors  do  not  have  time  to  run  from  pillar  to  post  for  various  complex  formalities  and  in  bureaucratic terms, guiding applications through a disjointed and inefficient administrative process.                                                                    
133

 More transparency is clearly required to ensure that construction takes place on time and that NGOs and regular meetings with line officers  and reports back to higher bureaucrats keeps the middlemen in line.  134  Susan Chaplin's study on politics of sanitation reveals obvious weaknesses due to the range of interests at play in the sanitation context. 

192   

Commentators pose the binary solution to the toilet problem as residing within the public or the private  sector.   In  a  city  and  country  where  millions  are  denied  basic  services  like  clean  water  and  sanitation,  such  statements  undermine  the  complexity  of  problems  as  well  as  solutions.   Part  of  the  solution  is  the  provision  of  secure  housing  in  which  sanitation  is  an  integral  part.  But  until  that  can  be  achieved  (and  currently  it  seems  an  almost  insurmountable  problem),  facilities  for  the  poor  will  have  to  be  subsidised  so that they may be spared the indignity that accompanies the lack of sanitation.  Subsidization can take  a  number  of  forms  as  discussed  earlier  and  needs  to  be  approached  and  documented  simultaneously  with  transparency  between  state  and  nonstate  actors.   Such  measures  seem  to  be  the  responsible  for  the  lack  of  potential  in  having  these  sanitation  solutions  balancing  community  strengths  with  state  machinery weaknesses.

6.4.2

The Case of Dharavi: An Unsuccessful Outcome

Since  the  1980s,  the  Society  for  the  Protection  of  Area  Resources  (SPARC)  has  been  supporting  and  advocating  for  the  rights  of  India's  8  million  slum  dwellers  and  informal  communities.  The  struggle  to  extend  services  to  slum  dwellers  has  been  more  politically  charged  as  Mumbai's  slums  are  among  the  most  dense  and  volatile  in  the  world.  Not  only  are  Mumbai's  slums  more  vulnerable  to  evictions  and  demolition,  but  they  are  also  the  sites  of  sophisticated  networks  of  patronage,  revolving  around  slum  lords  and  local  state  actors.  SPARC  has  been  increasingly  involved  in  the  design  and  operation  of  local  toilet  blocks,  many  of  them  based  on  the  SI  `twin  flush  system'.  The  challenges  faced  by  SPARC  and  other  advocates  for  support  to  slum  dwellers,  highlight  the  need  for  well  resourced,  focused  interventions in dense, sophisticated slum contexts. 

6.4.2.1 Background
Generations  of  migrant  labourers  have  swelled  the  ranks  of  Mumbai's  informal  settlements  since  colonial  rule.  Some  villages  however,  developed  into  slums  as  the  city  grew  around  them.    The  most  documented  and  researched  example  of  this  is  Dharavi,  the  largest  slum  in  Mumbai.  Dharavi  is  also  the 

193   

oldest  slum,  characterized  by  power  structures  that  are  well  beyond  the  control  of  state  authorities135.  The  first  official  enumeration  of  the  population  living  in  slums  was  performed  in  1976  and  found  2.8  million  people  living  in  1,680  settlements  across  city.  The  total  population  was  then  5.9  million.  The  2nd  count in 1983 found 1,930 settlements containing 4.3 million people. The most recent estimates are that  forty percent of the city's citizens are living in only 3.5 percent of the city's area (Maneschka, 2011).   The majority of Dharavi's slum dwellings are not connected to the city's two tier sewage system. Several  capital  and  operational  challenges  prevent  service  delivery  extension.  A  survey  in  1986  revealed  that  that  there  were  800  toilet  blocks  in  Dharavi,  for  a  population  around  400,000  people.  This  equates  to  only  1520  toilets  per  block,  which  has  remained  unchanged,  despite  Mumbai's  population  having  since  doubled.  Of  these  facilities,  a  third  are  filthy,  broken  down  and  generally  unusable.  Many  slum  dwellers  find it safer to defecate in the open than to use them. The sewage from these facilities is discharged into  open  drains  and  combines  with  storm  water  to  flow  into  Mumbai's  coastal  zone.  In  the  1940s,  the  state  constructed  the  Dadar  sewage  treatment  plant  which  by  the  1970s  was  treating  ninety  percent  of  the  city's  sewage.  Over  time,  the  marine  outflow  system  was  outpaced  by  the  suburban  sprawl  and  with  unchecked aging infrastructure, it was phased out.    In  the  1990s,  the  Mumbai  Sewerage  Disposal  Project  (MSDP)  was  funded  by  a  World  Bank  loan  of  Rs  12  billion.  The  absence  of  drainage  plans  for  slum  settlements  resulted  in  delays.  After  some  redesign,  the  project  was  restarted  in  1997  as  the  Slum  Sanitation  Program  (SSP).  Slum  dwellers  would  be  engaged  through  a  onetime  payment  of  Rs.  100  ($2  USD).  By  the  end  of  the  year  2000  and  Rs.  700  million  in  investment,  only  17  toilet  blocks  had  been  constructed.  At  present,  only  forty  percent  of  the  WB  funds  have  been  utilized.  The  reasons  for  WB  failures  are  many.  A  lack  of  coordination  by  the  MMRDA  with  other  state  departments  (land  owners),  slum  congestion,  poor  engagement  in  design  with  slum  dwellers,  absence  of  MMRDA  engagement  of  CBO  during  design,  turnover  of  elected  officials  who  cut  political support for the project (or votes for service), logistics of material transport to dense slums, non

 During a conference visit to Dharavi, interview respondents indicated that the difficulties in setting up water connection points to the slums  was complicated by the presence of power structures within the slum and 'thug hierarchies' that prevented the work of development activists  from setting up the necessary infrastructure. 

194   

availability  of  labour,  partnercontractor  issues  (excessive  profit  taking)  and  delays  in  water  and  electricity connections from utilities to name a few. 

6.4.2.2 Intervention
SPARC  works  with  a  range  of  NGOs  within  the  Alliance,  to  set  up  toilet  blocks,  using  the  approach  of  community led total sanitation (CLDS). This approach ensures that CBOs are engaged in the design phase  with the needs of women, children, the elderly and the disabled all accounted for. Having seen that  civil  society  actors  are  reliable  partners  for  building  toilets  that  work,  many  government  authorities  have  partnered  with  the  Alliance  on  sanitation  projects136.  In  many  areas,  government  departments  provide  the capital costs and infrastructure for toilet blocks, while the communities select the space, and design,  construct and maintain the toilet.    Impressed  by  the  experience  of  other  cities,  the  Municipal  Corporation  of  Greater  Mumbai  (MCGM)  obtained  support  for  its  slum  sanitation  program  under  the  World  Bankassisted  Mumbai  Sewage  Disposal  Project  I  (MSDP  I).  In  the  ongoing  MSDP  II,  the  Alliance  won  the  tender  to  construct  150  toilet  blocks benefiting over 150,000 people.     The  State  government  MMRDA  also  launched  the  Nirmal  Mumbai  Metropolitan  Region  Abhiyan  (MMR)  project in 2007, envisaging the construction of 100,000 public toilets across the Greater Mumbai Region  in  two  years  for  a  total  of  Rs.  690  million.  The  model  for  these  toilet  blocks  are  similar  to  the  ones  constructed  under  MSDP.  A  number  of  the  contracted  and  Alliance  constructed  toilet  blocks  were  cancelled  due  to  problems  with  land  ownership,  CBO  disputes,  political  interference,  councillorCBO  conflict,  slum  redevelopment  and  space  constraints.  As  a  result  of  its  expertise  in  pointing  out  these 

                                                                  
136

 In 1999, the Alliance partnered with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to construct over 10,000 seats in community toilet blocks  benefiting approximately 500,000 slum dwellers, within one year.  The scale as well as the partnership between the municipality, NGOs and  CBOs was precedent setting. The PMC provided land, capital costs, water and electricity. NGOs and CBOs designed, built and maintained the  toilet blocks. The project put urban sanitation on the radar of government departments across India, as well as the World Bank's Water and  Sanitation Program (WSP).  Impressed by the Pune experiment, he Government of India (GOI) declared a new scheme that granted a fifty  percent subsidy to states and municipalities that took up toilet block construction in slums.

concerns,  SPARC  has  now  been  invited  to  be  a  member  of  the  National  Advisory  Group  on  Sanitation  (NAGOS) and the Governing Council of the World Bank's WSP.  SPARC's  critique  of  state  attempts  at  toilet  block  construction  is  blunt.  Traditionally,  the  government  builds  toilets  without  community  participation,  resulting  in  poor  quality  construction,  lack  of  water  and  electricity supply, and absence of proper maintenance and setting off a wasteful cycle of demolition and  reconstruction.  SPARC  has  noted  substantial  improvements  in  communitybased  sanitation  and  related  policies  and  programmes.  The  CLTS  model  of  slum  sanitation  has  been  successful  for  many  reasons.  Toilets  are  more  affordable.  While  private  providers  charge  12  rupees  per  person  per  use,  a  monthly  pass of Rs. 2530 covers unlimited use for an entire family.  A 1 rupee fee for passersby helps augment a  communitytoilet's  revenues,  which  pay  for  maintenance.  Community  developed  innovative  design  features  in  toilet  blocks,  including  a  caretaker's  room  and  children's  toilets.  The  former  provides  accommodation  and  an  employment  opportunity,  while  ensuring  good  cleaning  and  maintenance;  the  latter  helps  prevent  children  from  squatting  outside  because  of  their  inability  to  compete  with  adults  in  queues.  Since  2004,  Dharavi  has  been  the  target  of  massive  government  redevelopment  projects.  The  Alliance  has  been  working  at  various  levels  to  ensure  that  Dharavi's  development  is  inclusive  of  the  area's  residents and enterprises and opening a dialogue with the state. In 2007, SPARC moved from protesting  the  government's  Dharavi  Redevelopment  Project,  to  negotiating  and  planning  with  the  governmental  authorities,  planners  and  professionals  in  2008.  Although  the  NGO  faced  enormous  criticism  from  activists,  for  conceding  its  role  of  advocate  for  slum  dwellers,  their  position  has  changed  to  one  of  ensuring community engagement in slum redevelopment and/or resettlement137. Since 2009, SPARC has  been engaged in advocacy as well as operation of toilet blocks, leveraging its relationship with a network  of CBOs as well as the MMRDA.

 While SPARC has been criticized for adopting such positions, the dynamic of state/nonstate actors is reflective of the scale of slum  engagement in Mumbai and one cannot ignore the contextual variables that may necessitate such engagement.

The difference between state and Alliance operated toilet blocks is sharp. Alliance operated toilet blocks  have  a  decent  exterior  as  also  wellmaintained,  and  also  have  clean  interiors.  There  is  a  ready  provision  for  minor  repairs  such  as  electric  bulbs/tubelights/switches,  etc.,  or  for  fixing  minor  plumbing  problems.  The  structure  gets  attention  periodically  in  terms  of  painting,  major  repairs,  etc.  The  attendant,  who  is  given  residential  quarter  above  the  toilet  block,  collects  charges  and  oversees  maintenance  as  well  as  security.  Women  users  of  Sulabh  toilet  from  slums  admit  that  they  feel  safe  to  come  alone  to  a  Sulabh  toilet.   The  incidence  of  stomach  ailments  have  almost  vanished.   Earlier,  these  women  had  to  control  their  bowel  movements  till  night  fall,  as  early  morning  chores  made  it  impossible  to  go  to  dirty  toilets  or  open  spaces.  With  improvement  in  the  health  of  the  family,  socioeconomic  changes  have  followed.  Productivity  has  increased,  as  also  medical  expenses  have  come  down,  thus  improving  economic  condition  of  the  family.  The  toilets'  maintenance  costs  are  minimal  as  they  use  maximum  sunlight  and  air  to  save  on  energy  and  flushing  systems  use  water  conservation  for  irrigation.   Where  possible,  blocks  of  10  to  20  seats  have  a  biogas  plant.   A  Sulabh  toilet  block  of  20  seats  may  cost  more  (Rs  60,000  compared  to  Rs  40,000)  than  a  conventional  block,  but  quality  and  maintenance  features need to be  built in. Often, funds are not the problem;  bureaucratic and procedural hurdles are.   The  Lions  ClubMCGMSulabh  Friendship  Project  undertaken  in  2000,  spent  Rs  15,000,000  on  constructing  27  Sulabh  Shouchalayas  between  Bandra  and  Dahanu,  rather  than  Rs  50,000,000  due  to  clearance lags by the civic authorities leading to lapsed time and, consequently, lapsed budget.  The  current  public  toilet  blocks  in  the  slums  of  Mumbai  are  funded  from  a  number  of  sources.  Critics  point  out  that  no  matter  how  inadequate  and  unworkable,  the  infrastructure  that  exists  today  has  been  funded from public institutions, donors and elected officials138. The utilisation is only twenty five percent  because  of  design  flaws   unworkable  and  most  unhygienic  conditions  of  these  public  toilets.  This  is  due  to  poor  design,  a  result  of  upper  tier  interventions  without  consultation  with  lower  tier  actors.    As  a  result,  inappropriate  technology  has  been  implemented  along  with  mal  flushing  and  drainage  back  up.

 Funds available with Solid Waste Management Department of MCGM, Councillors', MLAs' and MPs' funds, Funds available under Slum  Improvement Scheme, MHADA for PSCs (public sanitary centres) in slums, Mumbai Port Trust in their jurisdiction, Funds available for Nirmal  Bharat Abhiyan, Mumbai Sewerage Disposal Project (MSDP) and other upper tier state actors.

Another  example  of  how  a  lack  of  funding  and  poor  intergovernmental  support,  checks  and  balances  is  resulting in mismanagement and poor maintenance at the lower tiers of service delivery.  Although  funding  of  the  construction  toilet  blocks  is  estimated  in  the  budgets,  there  is  no  provision  for  their  maintenance.    Assuming  that  under  the  conditionality  of  SSP,  people  will  get  involved  in  the  maintenance,  MCGM  stopped  recruiting  scavengers  to  clean  the  toilets.  So  neither  did  the  SSP  become  effective, nor did the MCGM take care of the maintenance. Now, daytoday cleaning, occasional repairs  of broken seats, doors, windows, taps, electric bulbs, etc., almost never take place. Water and electricity  charges  are  not  paid,  so  even  these  facilities  are  cut  off.  This  means  almost  7  million  (not  just  4  million)  slum  residents  are  forced  into  open  defecation.  Women,  especially,  are  the  worst  sufferers,  as  they  cannot  go  to  such  unsafe,  dirty  places;  nor  can  they  go  in  the  open  during  the  day.  Slumlords  extract  money  from  the  residents  for  using  the  public  sanitation  facility.  Often,  they  are  never  used  as  toilets  but for other unauthorised, illegal activities.   The  experiences  of  design  and  maintenance  from  across  Dharavi  illustrates  the  risks  of  scaling  up  solutions  without  the  requisite  knowledge  of  sustainment  models  and  operational  realities.  Toilet  block  initiatives  developed  and  sustained  at  the  lower  tiers  are  only  inundated  with  challenges  once  project  ownership  shifts  to  upper  tier  actors.  Although  its  models  were  initially  successful,  the  lower  tier  non state  actor  lacked  lower  tier  state  counterparts  with  which  to  develop  and  formalize  programs.  As  a  result,  the  lower  tier  nonstate  actor  (SPARC)  has  in  many  cases  been  drawn  into  controversial  resettlement  policies  with  upper  tier  state  actors  (MMRDA)  as  it  is  the  sole  advocate  for  the  informal  settlement.  Nevertheless,  the  failure  of  project  outcomes  needs  to  be  placed  on  the  lack  of  intergovernmental  support,  accountability  and  transparency  of  service  delivery  project  scoping  and  implementation.  The  tendency  of  the  upper  tier  actor  to  monopolize  the  scale  of  service  delivery  solution  development  undermines  the  abilities  of  lower  tier  actors.  In  the  absence  of  an  autonomous  utility, a project driven agenda is inevitable. 

6.4.2.3 NextSteps
The  contrasting  experiences  of  SPARC  and  other  state  run  programs  reveal  that  a  decentralized,  yet  site  specific  approach  is  required  where  the  community  owns  the  solutions  innovation,  installation,  implementation and operations and maintenance. Assuming 50 users per toilet and a block of 20 toilets,  there is a need for 4,000 such public toilet blocks for Mumbai's current slums.  At Rs 12 million per toilet  block of 20 seats, Rs 5 billion would be required. Even for 4 million slum dwellers having some sanitation  198   

facility, proper facilities are needed to push usage from the present twenty five to one hundred percent.  The  renovation  of  existing  toilets  would  cost  another  Rs  3  billion.  If  the  city's  slum  population  were  to  increase by five percent in a year an additional 400 sanitary blocks would be required at a cost of Rs 480  million.  Donors  have  the  funds,  but  it  is  cooperation  by  the  authorities  that  is  the  constraint.  Sulabh  International  has  a  proposal  for  toilets  along  the  eastern  and  western  highways  with  multiagency  donors  offering  Rs  10  billion  collectively.   The  sites  are  not  getting  cleared  for  various  reasons.  Citizens  should  insist  that  the  sites  should  be  given  on  lease  to  overcome  the  problem  of  free  land  and  the  scheme  should  be  opened  to  NGOs  and  CBOs.  Citizens  need  to  take  active  role  to  push  the  authorities  into taking decisions. They can file public interest litigation (PIL) case against the MCGM, as every citizen  has  the  right  to  know  plans,  the  right  to  protect  him/her  from  environmental  degradation  and  take  required  actions  to  improve  the  situation  in  their  community  (Burra,  2005).    In  other  words,  more  transparency and accountability is required to state and nonstate engagement. 

6.5 Mumbai's comparator variables and case studies
Primary and secondary evidence from Mumbai reveals a history of marginalized municipal development.  A  centralized  state  level  of  government  bearing  the  impressions  of  colonial  rule  and  elitism  has  persistently  neglected  the  needs  of  municipal  service  delivery  actors.  The  absence  of  political  representation,  intergovernmental  support  and  insufficient  pro  poor  initiatives  points  to  continued  neglect  by  the  national  and  state  government  elites  and  elected  officials.  However,  in  country  research  has  revealed  the  prominent  role  of  one  comparator  variable  in  extending  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements. Civil society and donor activity has countered the inertia and barriers presented by national  and  state  level  interests,  by  facilitating  the  engagement  of  informal  settlements  and  representative  CBOs  with  lower  tier  state  actors  such  as  the  MCGM.  The  persistent  lobbying,  knowledge  sharing  and  relationship  building  with  MCGM  officers  by  community  based  actors  (SI,  SPARC  and  the  CBOs)  has  led  to  efforts  at  supplying  water  and  facilitating  sanitation  services.  What  is  missing,  is  the  accountable  and  transparent  operations  of  an  autonomous  water  and  sanitation  service  delivery  provider.  Evidence  points  to  a  capital  intensive,  top  down  state  structure  that  neglects  the  operational  and  maintenance  needs at the site level.  

199   

The  influence  of  this  comparator  variable  is  also  illustrated  in  the  two  case  studies.  Outcomes  from  Dadar TT and Dharavi reveal the driving role that service delivery facilitating NGOs (SI and SPARC) play in  engaging  socially  mobilized  CBOs  and  extending  service  delivery.  In  Dadar  TT,  technical  assistance  from  the  NGO  (SI)  in  toilet  block  site  design  and  construction  is  critical  to  maximizing  usage.   SI  also  trains  a  local  CBO  to  operate  and  maintain  the  block,  which  in  turn,  ensures  that  the  service  delivery  infrastructure  is  sustained.  Calls  by  SI  and  CBOs  to  replicate  site  specific  designs  and  models  are  met  by  state  government  funding  and  top  down  planning  which  applies  `one  size  fits  all'  solutions  to  arbitrarily  selected  sites  and  contractors.  The  result  of  involvement  by  upper  tier  actors  and  elected  officials  is  capital  intensive  project  frameworks  and  scopes  that  sideline  operations  and  sustainment  considerations.  In  Dharavi,  technical  assistance  and  design  by  the  local  NGO  (SPARC)  has  led  to  sustainable  solutions  and  CBO  maintained  toilet  blocks.  However,  the  absence  of  a  lower  tier  water  and  sanitation  services  provider  has  disabled  efforts  to  replicate  this  model  across  the  slum.  The  absence  of  lower  tier  representatives  through  which  to  engage  in  community  based  planning,  has  allowed  the  persistence  of  state  government  led,  top  down  development  plans.   These  inevitably  cater  to  developer  interests  and  forced  evictions.  Findings  from  Mumbai  reveal  the  relationship  between  service  delivery  extension and a mobilized civil society.

7 Analysis of Research Findings
First,  I  should  point  to  the  difficulty  of  obtaining  information  in  all  of  the  three  mega  cities,  as  public  sector  activities  and  state  reports,  particularly  at  the  municipal  level,  are  not  regularly  published  or  readily available. This lack of access to information illustrates the absence of intergovernmental support,  accountability  frameworks,  and  transparent  reporting  mechanisms  between  upper  and  lower  tier  state  actors  which  hinders  service  delivery  (see  Table  I  in  the  next  subsection).  I  had  to  work  around  these  hindrances,  and  was  able  to  obtain  a  number  of  research  studies  and  project  reports  from  the  data  repositories  of  civil  society  actors  (ranging  from  the  smallest  CBOs  to  the  largest  multilateral  donors),  subject  matter  experts  (consultants  who  themselves  are  exbureaucrats,  civil  society  actors  or  academics)  and  technical  donors.  Second,  my  travel  to  Mumbai  was  constrained  due  to  visa  restrictions  on  people  of  Pakistani  heritage  from  travelling  to  India.  As  a  result,  I  was  unable  to  obtain  government  approval  to  travel  to  Mumbai  and  collect  primary  and  secondary  data.  Thanks  to  the  assistance  of  regional  NGOs  with  whom  I  have  established  longstanding  relationships,  I  was  able  to  contact  relevant  state  and  nonstate  actors  in  Mumbai  and  conduct  interviews  via  telephone.  I  was  also  able  to  meet  with  several  state  and  nonstate  actors  from  Mumbai  during  regional  workshops  and  conferences  in  Karachi,  Lahore,  Islamabad  and  Dhaka.  Through  these  meetings,  I  was  also  able  to  obtain  secondary  research  and  discuss  case  study  information  related  to  successful  and  unsuccessful  service  delivery  outcomes  specific  to  Mumbai.  The  implementation  of  my  study  methodology  was  inhibited  by  the  complex  and  opaque  political  and  administrative  settings  in  all  three  countries.  However,  a  history  of  relationship  building  and  shared  research  projects  with  South  Asia's  most  technically  proficient,  grass roots based and research oriented nonstate actors allowed me to compile and compare data, and draw  unique insights across the different municipal service delivery contexts.   Among  the  most  valuable  contributions  of  this  study  are  the  three  pairs  of  case  studies  that  I  documented  in each  mega city. I triangulated case study  evidence on the roles played  by state and non state actors by grouping comparator variables from both primary and secondary sources. Process tracing  was  used  to  detail  the  events  that  led  to  successful  and  unsuccessful  service  delivery  outcomes.  As  I  have  explained  in  earlier  chapters,  successful  service  delivery  outcomes  were  defined  as  cases  where  water  and/or  sanitation  infrastructure  was  planned  and  constructed  after  which  service  delivery  was  extended  to  the  informal  settlement  by  state  actors.  Successful  outcomes  were  also  characterized  by  some  level  of  formalized  cooperation  between  state  and  nonstate  actors  and  evidence  of  sustained  201   

service  delivery  to  informal  settlements  and  inhabitants.  Unsuccessful  service  delivery  outcomes  were  defined  as  cases  where  water  and/or  sanitation  infrastructure  was  planned,  but  not  constructed  or  extended  to  informal  settlements  despite  the  efforts  of  state  and/or  nonstate  actors.  By  documenting  these  outcomes  (see  section  7.1.1.,  Table  1),  I  was able  to  conduct  a  comparative  analysis  of  influencing  variables  across  each  of  the  service  delivery  settings.  Furthermore,  by  engaging  with  `on  the  ground'  NGOs and CBOs, I was also able to gather contextspecific information about service delivery outcomes.   Analyses of data from each of the three mega cities revealed a range of tensions between state and non state  actors,  all  of  which  influenced  service  delivery.  Triangulation  of  comparator  variables  revealed  the  root  causes  of  these  tensions:  all  three  `unplanned'  mega  cities  have  experienced  continual  social  and  economic  stratification.  The  creation  of  wellplanned  and  sufficiently  serviced  enclaves  for  the  ruling  class are in glaring contrast to the squalor and neglect of informal settlements and poor neighbourhoods  which  struggle  to  survive.  The  divide  between  rich  and  poor  has  widened  due  to  private  developer  influence, marketoriented policies and other forces stemming from neoliberalism. Similarly, gaps across  state and society have persisted as service delivery machinery (water and sanitation utility) continues to  be  underfunded.  The  combination  of  neglect  and  interference  by  elected  officials,  absence  of  intergovernmental  relations  (concentration  of  decisionmaking  power  with  the  bureaucracy's  upper  tiers),  and  badly  implemented  `pro  poor  policies'  (which  usually  result  in  benefits  being  captured  by  higher  income  groups)  reveals  the  inability  of  `the  state'  to  provide  for  all  citizens.  The  absence  of  accountability  and  transparency  mechanisms  results  in  the  exploitation  of  services  by  corrupt  state  actors  and  organized  crime.  As  evidenced  by  my  research,  many  of  these  actors  and  interests  gain  political  and  economic  power  at  the  expense  of  the  lower  tiers  of  the  state.  For  instance,  market  facing  policies and other instruments of neoliberalism have enabled elites (including uppertier state actors) to  assume  positions  of  power  within  the  state.  Once  established,  they  maintain  their  positions  by  appropriating  public  resources  (land,  water,  public  funds)  for  personal  profit  and  charging  weaker  segments  of  society  who  now  struggle  with  scarcity,  for  insufficient  services.  Despite  this  disabling  environment,  civil  society  research  and  advocacy  efforts  have  successfully  linked  the  needs  of  informal  settlements  with  the  capabilities  of  lower  tier  water  and  sanitation  authorities.  The  result  has  been  an  increase  in  civil  society  mobilization  of  informal  settlements  and  community  based  development  from  the `bottom up' to demand services. Let us now discuss the influence of comparator variables on service  delivery. 

202   

7.1 Influences of Comparator Variables
The  influence  of  each  of  the  comparator  variables  (political  representation,  intergovernmental  support,  pro  poor  initiatives,  accountability  and  transparency,  and  donor/civil  society  activity)  on  service  delivery  outcomes  in  each  of  the  three  mega  cities  represent  the  range  of  neoliberal  forces  that  converge  on  informal  settlements.  The  conditions  that  result  from  the  pervasiveness  of  neoliberalism,  contribute  to  almost identical outcomes in each of the water and sanitation service delivery contexts.   My  research  revealed  that  elected  officials  and  upper  tier  state  actors  are  not  inclined  to  advocate  for  service delivery to informal settlements. In each mega city and case study, elected officials (national and  state/provincial  level)  exhibited  persistent  neglect  when  approached  by  nonstate  actors  to  extend  water  and  sanitation  services  to  informal  settlements.  In  fact,  nonstate  actors  in  Karachi,  and  informal  sector workers in Dhaka and Mumbai, alleged that elected officials benefit from the status quo, where a  culture  of  `votes  for  services'  prevails.  What  happens  is  that  the  party  (individual)  in  power  withholds  services  to  communities  until  local  votes  are  mobilized  which  ensures  that  the  local  representative  is  elected.  This  ensures  the  dependency  of  informal  settlements  (and  informal  sector  workers)  on  political  actors. Although elected officials and upper tier state actors visited informal settlements during election  campaigns  (specifically  Korail  basti  and  Dharavi),  their  promises  of  service  delivery  and  basic  necessities  remained  unfulfilled.  Other  upper  tier  state  actors  such  as  development  authorities  (e.g.,  Karachi  Development  Authority  (KDA),  Mumbai  Municipal  Redevelopment  Authority  (MMRDA),  and  Bangladesh  State  Development  Authority  (RAJUK))  have  also  operated  in  an  opaque  manner,  by  withholding  development  plans  and  excluding  informal  settlements  from  development  decision  making139.  The  concentration  of  planning  power  in  small,  secluded  groups  of  upper  tier  state  actors,  obscures  already  weak accountability mechanisms. These development authorities also overlook the operating challenges  facing  lower  tier  actors.  In  contrast,  these  development  authorities  cater  to  the  large  projects  and  planning  cycles  of  private  developers  and  elite  backers,  despite  the  failure  of  most  large  projects  and

 The KDA for example, does not facilitate or coordinate development policies with other municipal departments and agencies such as the  KWSB. It does not consult with state departments or communities who could be affected by development plans.

consequent  waste  of  funds140.  The  collective  neglect  of  these  elected  officials  and  upper  tier  actors  has  permitted  the  exploitation  of  service  delivery  mechanisms  (and  informal  settlements)  by  criminal  elements. I will return to the implications of criminal activity later, now that we can see the harm that is  done by upper tier actors on both informal settlements and lower tier state actors.  Unsurprisingly,  elected  officials  and  upper  tier  state  actors  across  each  of  the  mega  cities  have  been  unwilling  to  implement  legislated  land  reforms  or  secure  the  tenure  of  informal  settlements.  Secondary  research  from  each  national  policy  context  revealed  at  least  some  recognition/mention  of  informal  settlements  (slums,  basti,  goths,  katchi  abadis,  or  low  income  areas)  in  policy  development  discussions  and  legislation.  However,  evidence  from  each  case  study  revealed  the  inability  of  elected  officials  and  upper  tier  state  actors  to  resolve  jurisdictional  land  disputes  (e.g.,  Ghazi  Goth,  Korail  Basti,  Dharavi)  or  resolve  repeat  development  claims  (e.g.,  Kalyanpura  Basti)  in  favour  of  informal  settlements.  Many  political  actors  were  actually  involved  (directly  or  indirectly)  in  the  manipulation  of  already  weakened  policies  and  departmental  mandates  to  ensure  their  continued  illegal  appropriation  of  public  land  for  personal  gain.  Represented  by  sophisticated  networks  of  oppressive  slum  lords  (mastaans)  and  neighborhood  thugs  (e.g.,  Ghazi  Goth)  party  leaders  and  upper  tier  political  actors  (i.e.,  Dharavi):  have  been  able  to  extract  rents  and  utility  services  (water,  gas  and  electricity)  from  informal  settlements.  Weak policy frameworks have permitted the proliferation of criminal activity.   Pro  poor  initiatives,  such  as  affordable  housing  programs,  slum  upgrading  policies,  and  resettlement  plans  have  experienced  limited  success  as  they  have  been  characterized  by  a  culture  of  `policy  formalism.'  Each  of  these  initiatives  emerged  from  intense  lobbying  by  NGOs,  CBOs  and  representatives  of  informal  settlements.  Across  each  of  the  mega  cities,  nonstate  actors  (SKAA  in  Karachi  and  SPARC  in  Mumbai)  actively  lobbied  the  state  for  policies  and  programs  to  provide  shelter.  However,  once  the  policy  agenda  setting  stage  began,  upper  tier  actors  ignored  the  requirements,  needs  analysis,  and

 In many instances, the waste of funds has been attributed to over payment of contractors, siphoning by project managers and consultants  and kickbacks to state actors for awarding contracts to preferred bidders. In the past, critics of such large projects attributed wastage to the  larger multilateral donors who benefitted from demonstrating projects being initiated and funds being deployed, as part of the 'trickle down'  model of economic stimulation. My findings illustrate that the waste attributed to such an approach is more complicated. While a discussion of  'waste' of funds is a broader discussion that deserves more perspective, I merely raise the point here to illustrate that project failure is allowed  to persist, regardless of the driving forces, with the costs contributing to already staggering debt levels.

research  of  these  representatives  (SPARC,  Amrao  Manush,  and  SKAA).  Over  time,  poorly  conceived  agendas  were  followed  by  weak  formulation,  because  consensus  building  excluded  relevant  stakeholders.  Generally,  it  was  the  development  lobby  who  was  engaged  (rather  than  representatives  and  advocates  for  informal  settlements)  and  benefits  were  captured  by  higher  income  groups.  Poor  intergovernmental  support  led  to  ineffective  resource  allocation:  politically  motivated  initiatives  are  timebound  and  do  not  receive  sustained  levels  of  funding.  When  the  final  resettlement  plans  emerged  from  the  poorly  conceived  policy  process,  nonstate  actors  were  forced  to  silence  protesters  and  essentially acquiesce to resettlements plans (SPARC in Dharavi) and in turn are quickly blamed for policy  failures.  Many  critics  have  accused  these  nonstate  actors  of  `selling  out'  informal  settlements,  but  my  evidence revealed that they are merely another victim of poor, onesided policies and a culture of policy  formalism.  Furthermore,  where  their  programs  are  effective  (Amrao  Manush  in  Dhaka),  upper  tier  actors fail to support their efforts.  Primary  and  secondary  evidence  across  each  of  the  mega  cities  and  informal  settlements  (Korail  Basti,  Ghazi Goth and Dharavi) pointed to the illegal activities of local power brokers (providing illegal services)  serving as fronts for upper tier state actors and elitist `network partners.' Residents of Karachi, Mumbai,  and  Dhaka  commonly  referred  to  the  role  of  the  `water  tanker  mafia'  and  collusion  between  organized  crime and elected officials. As noted, upper tier actors (including elected officials and bureaucrats) were  often  landlords  of  illegal  developments  and/or  linked  with  `mastaans,'  the  `land  mafia'  and  `slum  lords'  who  retain  power  and  extract  rents  from  informal  settlements  on  their  behalf.  The  failure  of  intergovernmental  support  has  resulted  in  the  proliferation  of  these  criminal  networks  and  the  continued  appropriation  of  public  resources,  such  as  Dhaka's  water  pilferage  networks,  Karachi's  illegal  hydrant  and  tanker  mafia  (permitted  and  profited  from  by  military  officers),  and  Mumbai's  slum  lord  appropriation  of  toilet  blocks.  This  has  perpetuated  the  reliance  of  informal  settlements  on  illegal  providers of water, at 10Â­15 times the public water tariff.   Despite  the  indifference  of  state  actors,  nonstate  actors  have  diligently  exposed  and  disentangled,  where  possible,  administrative  constraints  to  extending  service  delivery.  Persistent  relationship  building  and  meticulous  documentation  by  nonstate  actors  has  made  opaque  government  processes  more  transparent and in turn, facilitated  the  extension of  service delivery to informal settlements. Alternative  service delivery models have experienced success where technocratic NGOs and donors have assisted in  the education and mobilization of CBOs. Successful outcomes have also been realized as NGOs and CBOs  205   

engage  lower  tier  service  delivery  actors  through  project  management  parameters.  For  example,  non state  actors  (Sulabh  International,  SPARC)  have  demonstrated  that  service  delivery  solutions  are  more  likely to be successful if communitybased actors are included in design and sustainment planning.   In contrast, success is constrained when the state  does not recognize  nonstate efforts and  continues to  cater to market interests (land developers) and other neoliberal forces. For example, the Amrao Manush  shelter  program  (Dhaka)  provides  pavement  dwellers  with  access  to  a  range  of  health  and  education  services.  Despite  its  documented  success,  the  donordependent  program  has  failed  to  grow  beyond  eight  independent  centres,  due  to  developerinfluenced  mandates  of  upper  tier  state  actors  and  the  absence  of  intergovernmental  support.  Similarly,  when  the  SKAA  program  leadership  migrated  from  the  province  (Sindh)  to  the  municipality  (Karachi),  upper  and  lower  tier  state  actors  were  hesitant  about  formally  recognizing  `one  window'  service  delivery  models  as  effective  vehicles  for  allocation  of  state  lands  for  poor,  homeless  migrants.  They  have  also  dismissed  the  successes  of  progressive  programs,  such  as  the  Dhaka  WASA  lowincome  wing  that  facilitates  services  to  slums  through  CBO  and  NGO  engagement.  SAIBAAN's  reach  (as  well  as  that  of  the  KWSB)  has  thus  been  hindered  by  the  lack  of  political  will  to  challenge  neoliberal  policies  and  provided  the  necessary  intergovernmental  support.  Together,  the  evidence  points  to  the  need  to  increase  autonomy  of  lower  tier  state  service  delivery  providers in order to counterbalance market actors and other forces stemming from neoliberalism.  

7.1.1

Case Study Illustrations

The case studies that I have undertaken lend further support to my research findings as well as illustrate  the  underlying  success  and  failures  of  each  case  (see  Table  1  below).  My  case  studies  illustrated  the  enabling  role  of  lower  tier  state  and  nonstate  actors  in  extending  service  delivery.  For  instance,  when  faced  with  eviction,  informal  settlements  mobilized  and  became  politically  active  in  engaging  state  actors,  demanding  recognition  (Dost  Muhammed  Jungar  Goth,  Kalyanpura  Basti).  This  resulted  in  incremental  progress  towards  service  delivery.  Similarly,  when  sanitation  services  became  so  dilapidated,  informal  settlements  rallied  behind  NGOs  for  community  designed  and  managed  solutions  (Dadar  TT).  Once  engaged,  municipal  officers  at  the  lower  tiers  eventually  supported  nonstate  efforts  by  facilitating  service  delivery  to  all  informal  settlements.  The  degree  to  which  these  efforts  were  supported  ranged  from  informal  cooperation  (KWSB  and  OPP  in  Ghazi  Goth  and  Dost  Muhammed  Jungar  Goth)  to  formally  recognized  support  and  documented  agreements  (DWASA  and  DSK  in  Kalyanpura  Basti  and  Korail  Basti).  Lower  tier  actors  have  responded  favorably  to  the  provision  of  206   

`information  assets'  by  nonstate  actors  by  incorporating  them  into  decision  making.  In  all  cases,  the  syntheses  of  social  maps  (DSK),  physical  maps,  and  surveys  (OPP  and  SI)  by  nonstate  actors  has  made  up  for  the  absence  of  official  maps,  departmental  plans,  and  state  surveys141.  In  some  cases,  upper  tier  state  actors  appropriated  the  social  capital,  trust,  and  relationshipbuilding  established  by  nonstate  actors  (SPARC).142  Finally,  the  cooperation  of  state  and  nonstate  actors  in  service  delivery  extension,  from the design to sustainability, has contributed to improved service delivery (OPP, DSK, and SI).  Case  studies  also  revealed  a  number  of  barriers  associated  with  upper  and  lower  tier  actors.  As  discussed  above,  political  actors  and  elected  officials  had  not  engaged  with  any  of  the  communities  under  study.  This  widespread  neglect  revealed  a  preference  for  the  status  quo  and  `votes  for  services.'  Many  elected  officials  were  implicated  in  land  ownership  disputes  at  the  individual  and  institutional  levels  (Korail  Basti,  Kalyanpura  Basti,  Dadar  TT,  Ghazi  Goth).  Many  upper  tier  state  actors  have  also  been alleged to have appropriated public land themselves, for personal gain. Intergovernmental support  has  been  lacklustre  in  most  cases:  the  lack  of  clear  jurisdictional  lines  between  upper  and  lower  tier  actors  has  prevented  the  support  for  and  extension  of  services  to  informal  settlements  (Ghazi  Goth  and  Korail  Basti).  This  has  permitted  organized  crime  (a  front  for  the  above  mentioned  upper  tier  state  actors),  and  has  also  contributed  to  evictions  of  informal  settlements  and  death  threats  against  community actors (Ghazi Goth, Dost Muhammed Jungar Goth, Korail Basti, and Kalyanpura Basti).   Table  4  summarizes  the  conditions  in  each  successful  and  unsuccessful  case  study.  Certain  variables  (political  representation,  intergovernmental  support,  pro  poor  initiatives)  appeared  not  to  be  linked  with  positive  influences  on  service  delivery  outcomes,  while  others  (accountability  and  transparency,  civil society activity) were consistently linked to successful service delivery outcomes.

 In many instances, state actors simply do not gather data at the municipal level beyond time bound studies contracted to consultants and  donors. Where data is available, it is out of date or largely inaccurate. State actors will criticize the records of nonstate actors in the same way,  but there is little evidence of reliable state owned data, in any of the three mega cities, that has been the basis of service delivery extension to  informal settlements. In the case of Karachi, even the master plans that have been proposed for large scale sewage projects have been drafted  by nonstate actors such as the OPP RTI.   142  Whether these plans were successful or not (resettlement plans in the case of SPARC) is of great debate across the development literature.  My research notes that SPARC has unfairly shouldered the blame for poorly managed resettlement plans due to the political economy of policy  development and concentration of power at the upper tiers of India's state governments. 

207   

In  each  pair  of  case  studies,  three  variables  exhibited  similar  effects  on  service  delivery  outcomes.  Political  representatives  demonstrated  neglect  for  informal  settlements  while  intergovernmental  relations  revealed  little,  if  any  support  for  municipal  service  departments.  Similarly,  pro  poor  initiatives  remained  ineffective  in  reaching  target  recipients.  Evidence  specific  to  two  variables,  accountability  and  transparency  as  well  as  civil  society  activity  revealed  their  influence  on  service  delivery.  Where  the  public  utility  demonstrated  some  level  of  accountability  and  transparency  in  cooperating  with  civil  society NGOs and CBOs, in extending services to informal settlements, positive outcomes resulted.

The  case  studies  clearly  revealed  that  exploitation  of  informal  sector  labourers  by  capitalists  continues  unabated.  The  informal  sector  represents  a  hyper  exploited  segment  of  society,  reminiscent  of  the  exploitation  experienced  by  the  peasantry  at  the  hands  of  rural  elites  and  capitalists  in  years  past.  As  I  mentioned  in  the  introductory  chapter,  a  comprehensive  exploration  of  the  relationship  between  capitalism  and  the  informal  sector  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  analysis.  Nevertheless,  the  human  development  implications  resulting  from  the  spread  of  neoliberalism  must  be  recognized.  Case  studies  revealed  a  threshold  of  cooperation  between  lower  tier  state  and  nonstate  actors  that  permits  the  extension of services to informal settlements. For instance, Dhaka's DWASA ensures that clear roles and  responsibilities  are  understood  and  adhered  to  by  lower  tier  actors,  NGOs,  and  CBOs.  This  has  led  to  service  delivery  connections  and  engagement  of  informal  settlements  (Kalyanpura  Basti).  In  contrast,  Karachi's  KWSB  is  tied  to  intergovernmental  tensions  while  Mumbai's  water  and  sanitation  department  is  bound  to  an  inefficient  municipal  corporation.  In  these  latter  mega  cities,  there  are  no  clear  lines  of  accountability,  transparency,  or  engagement  between  state  actors  and  informal  settlements,  and  utility  staff members are constrained from carrying out their basic duties.   The  combination  of  misaligned  departments,  legacy  administrations,  and  gaps  in  weak  policy  frameworks  provides  opportunities  for  collusion  and  exploitation  by  elitist  interests.  This  is  the  case  across  all  three  mega  cities,  where  lower  tier  departments  with  little  support,  limited  alignment  and  overlapping  mandates  continue  to  operate  inefficiently  and  in  some  cases,  ineffectively.  This  dynamic  is  another  outcome  of  neoliberalism,  which  continues  to  direct  upper  tier  state  resources  towards  the  market,  accusing  the  lower  tiers  of  being  incapable  and  incompetent.  For  example,  upper  tier  state  actors  and  planning  authorities  tend  to  embrace  large  capital  projects  without  appreciating  operating  and  sustainment  concerns.  Once  maintenance  functions  are  transferred  to  lower  tier  departments,  projects  inevitably  fail  due  to  the  lack  of  resources.  Against  the  backdrop  of  failing  infrastructure,  informal  settlements  are  forced  pay  exorbitant  prices  for  illegally  supplied  services.  In  contrast,  networks  of  elite  neighbourhoods  leverage  their  upper  tier  lobbies  to  navigate  the  'iron  mesh'  of  intergovernmental  procedures  and  secure  services.  So,  while  informal  settlements  struggle  with  broken  public services, elites obtain services to meet their needs. While the lower tiers struggle with addressing  the  demands  of  an  impatient  public,  options  for  private  sector  participation  are  pushed  by  the  upper  tiers,  without  resolving  the  lack  of  resources  and  operational  autonomy  that  constrains  lower  tier  state  actors.  In  order  to  remedy  the  vicious  cycle  of  public  service  deterioration,  lower  tier  departments  such  as  the  KWSB  and  'Mumbai  works'  are  in  urgent  need  of  institutional  disentanglement  and  autonomy  209   

from  the  political  interests  of  upper  tier  state  actors.  Without  autonomy,  large,  unsustainable  capital  projects will continued to eclipse operational concerns, driving public utilities to ruin. Alternative service  delivery  solutions  (SKAA  'One  Window',  DWASA  'NGO  models')  will  remain  celebrated,  yet  isolated  pilot  projects.  

7.2 Key Findings and Emerging themes from mega city analysis
In  light  of  the  comparator  variables  and  case  studies,  a  number  of  key  findings  emerge  from  my  study,  which  directly  engage  the  research  questions  presented  in  the  opening  chapter.  First,  upper  tier  state  actors  continue  to  demonstrate  a  lack  of  will  and  even  capacity  to  engage  the  human  development  needs  of  informal  settlements  in  large  mega  cities  across  South  Asia.  Second,  autonomous,  lower  tier  state  actors  have  been  found  to  be  better  suited  to  engage  civil  society  to  enable  human  development,  as  compared  to  their  upper  tier  state  counterparts.  Finally,  mobilized  informal  communities  can  move  the state Â­ corruption and all notwithstanding Â­ to respond to their service delivery needs.  CBOs have a  significant  role  in  influencing  NGOs  and  lowertier  state  functionaries  into  action  with  NGOs  demonstrating  benefits  the  benefits  of  cooperation  for  all  parties.  My  analysis  of  comparator  variables  and  case  study  outcomes  elaborates  on  these  findings  through  five  important  central  themes  that  emerge  in  terms  of  service  delivery  to  informal  settlements  in  mega  cities  in  developing  countries:  (1)  Precariousness of informal settlements; (2) Colonial legacy in urbanization and postcolonial realities; (3)  Success  and  failures  of  community  based  mobilization;  (4)  Need  for  decentralized  governance  models;  and  (5)  The  growing  ruralurban  divide  and  the  absent  state.  I  will  now  expand  on  these  themes  in  the  remaining sub sections.  

7.2.1 Precariousness of Informal Settlements
Evidence  from  all  three  mega  cities  illustrates  the  precarious  condition  of  informal  settlements.  The  absence  of  land  tenure,  state  supports  and  basic  services  has  made  habitation  difficult  to  begin  with.  The  lack  of  sufficient  water  and  sanitation  facilities  intensifies  precariousness  by  forcing  informal  sector  workers,  particularly  poor  women,  to  travel  great  distances  (and  risk  harassment  and  assault)  to  find  a  hand  pump  or  working  toilet.  As  more  displaced  rural  labourers  join  the  mega  city's  informal  sector  and  struggle  to  find  employment,  population  density,  poverty  and  service  scarcity  spread  across  these  communities.   210   

Those  who  are  able  to  find  habitation  in  these  settlements,  face  exploitation  by  organized  criminals  and  networks  of  elites.  For  instance,  land  rents  are  extracted  by  criminals  for  occupancy  in  the  informal  settlement,  the  land  of  which  is  usually  owned  by  elites.  Protection  money  is  also  paid  to  local  gangs  to  fight  off  rivals  who  represent  other  elites  looking  to  expand  their  territory  in  a  lawless,  urban  context.  Utility  rents  are  paid  for  the  illegal  connections  to  water,  sanitation  and  power  lines,  as  services  are  already  in  scarce  supply.  This  intensifies  precariousness  for  the  most  marginalized,  as  discussed  earlier.  This  is  in  addition  to  the  'votes  for  services'  as  outlined  earlier.  This  situation  is  further  complicated  as  adjacent,  higher  income  communities  grow  fearful  that  increases  in  informal  settlement  demand  will  reduce  supply  to  their  neighbourhoods  (Korail  Basti,  Dost  Mohammed  Junjhar  Goth).  Poorly  formulated  upper  tier  policies  rarely  buttress  lower  tier  programs  and  services,  leave  alone  engage  recipient  communities  such  as  informal  settlements.  Such  'policy  isolation'  leaves  informal  settlements  in  a  state  of lawlessness.    A  wide  range  of  socio  economic  groups,  representing  various  ethnicities  and  vocations  make  urban  informal  settlements  their  home.  The  diversity  of  employment  types  is  mirrored  by  the  variance  in  earnings:  income  groups  in  these  settlements  range  from  the  `moderately  poor'  to  the  `extremely  poor'  (MUH  HDC,  2007).  The  `moderately  poor'  include  merchants,  rickshaw  drivers  and  cottage  industry  owners  while  the  `very  poor,'  include  labourers,  garment  workers,  and  spare  parts  and  raw  materials  suppliers.  The  `extremely  poor'143  include  day  labourers,  garbage  collectors,  recyclers,  home  workers,  and food suppliers: they have no assets and are often homeless. The economic activities of these groups  form  sophisticated  supply  chains  and  networks,  the  study  of  which  is  beyond  the  scope  of  my  research.  However, it is important to note that marginalization of any one group, will have negative consequences  for the others. For instance, if raw material prices are kept low, informal sector workers have less to pay  for  services  such  as  food  and  transportation,  which  would  inject  money  into  other  parts  of  the  informal  settlement.  Inevitably,  as  the  mega  city  grows,  so  do  the  ranks  of  the  informal  sector  as  well  as  the  numbers and complexities of informal settlements.                                                                    
143

 Some CBOs and NGOs such as DSK and SPARC refer to this group as the 'hardcore poor', who have no social or economic assets and are the  most vulnerable to shocks. 

211   

In  all  three  municipalities  many  precariously  employed  informal  sector  workers  are  the  sole  income  earners  for  their  households  and/or  for  making  remittances  to  home  villages.  As  discussed,  a  significant  proportion  of  their  income  is  extracted  by  rents  which  diverts  income  away  from  human  development  efforts  such  as  accessing  education  and  health  care.  They  have  no  security  in  terms  of  employment:  their `contracts' can be terminated at a moment's notice, which places them increasingly at the mercy of  their  employers.  Home  based  work  is  also  precarious  both  economically  and  environmentally.  In  addition  to  retail  storefronts  and  other  cottage  industries,  informal  settlements  are  home  to  recycling  'garages',  where  plastics,  tin,  aluminum  and  other  materials  are  separated  for  resale.  These  recycling  'garages'  are  hubs  for  informal  waste  collectors  (often  referred  to  as  'scavengers'  or  'street  sweepers')  who collectively, provide the mega city with garbage collection service, and helps ensure that household  and  industrial  waste  is  disposed  of.  In  turn,  these  recycling  'garages'  provide  industry  with  an  inexpensive  source  of  raw  material.  Unfortunately,  the  lack  of  organization  of  this  sector  is  exploited  by  industry,  who  exert  downward  pressure  on  raw  material  prices.  This  unorganized  sector  also  absorbs  the  hazards  of  the  recycling  occupation  and  levels  of  pollution  and  hazardous  materials  are  far  above  average  in  these  areas.  For  example,  recycling  hazardous  materials  such  as  electronic  waste  leads  to  increased  toxic  waste,  which  can  be  deadly  even  in  trace  amounts.  Thus,  labourers  engaged  in  the  collection, processing, and supplying of recycled raw  materials face risks and levels of selfexploitation. I  will  return  to  this  term  later,  but  mention  it  here  to  show  the  relationship  between  precarious  settlements and the selfexploitation of informal sector workers.  The  most  marginalized  informal  sector  labourers  are  subjected  to  the  most  precarious  employment  and  selfexploitation.  Pavement  and  informal  settlement  dwellers  are  often  migrants  who  have  recently  arrived  from  rural  areas  in  search  of  employment.  Most  have  brought  or  used  all  of  their  savings  and  must  generate  more  before  returning  to  their  villages  and/or  supporting  other  hopeful  migrants.  They  are often at the mercy of previous migrants and the opportunities that they have created: those without  kinship or ethnic ties in the settlement must take or `make' whatever employment opportunities exist. It  must  be  recognized  that  a  mutually  reinforcing  relationship  exists  between  the  formal  and  informal  economies,  with  the  latter  continuing  to  occupy  public  land  out  of  necessity,  until  rising  land  values  prompt  the  former  to  conduct  forced  evictions,  increasing  the  patterns  of  urban  displacement.  The  result  is  precarious  employment  and  a  pattern  of  selfexploitation:  many  of  the  new  migrants  collect  waste  or  scavenge,  providing  larger  recycling  firms  with  recoverable  metals,  glass,  and  other  raw  materials.  As  downward  pressure  continues  to  be  applied  on  wages  by  capitalists  they  have  no  choice  212   

but  to  work  longer  hours  to  earn  a  living.  Many  are  employed  by  urban  capitalists,  whose  sprawling  mansions and local economies entrench social and economic divides along class lines. The concentration  of  labour  surpluses  in  isolated  spatial  contexts  will  continue  to  lead  to  new  hierarchies  of  informality  outside  the  jurisdiction  of  the  state.  Without  recognition  by  state  actors  and  the  extension  of  service  delivery,  informal  settlements  will  continue  to  be  treated  as  pools  of  surplus  labour  ready  for  exploitation  by neoliberal forces with little support for human development. In turn, complex forms and  patterns of selfexploitation will continue to be replicated across the mega city.  

7.2.2

Colonial legacy in urbanization and post-colonial

realities
The  second  theme  that  emerged  from  the  findings  is  the  relationship  between  South  Asia's  colonial  legacy  and  urbanization.  The  effects  of  this  relationship  have  persisted  and  are  part  of  the  postcolonial  reality of South Asia's mega cities. It is clear that the marginalization of informal settlements is implicitly  linked  to issues of state and development, and is rooted in forces  dating back to colonialism. In all three  mega  cities,  settlements  have  been  established  along  class  lines.  During  the  peak  of  the  British  Empire's  reign  over  India  and  South  Asia,  colonial  rulers  ensured  that  their  officers  and  members  of  the  ruling  class  were  housed  in  wellbuilt  and  established  enclaves  in  each  city.  These  communities  were  well  planned  and  distinguished  by  paved  roads,  street  lighting,  public  facilities,  and  water  and  sanitation  infrastructure. Native administrators, groomed from the local elite, also enjoyed above average facilities  and  services,  albeit  not  as  comfortable  as  their  colonial  masters  (S  U  Ahmed,  2010).  Nevertheless,  their  quarter  of  the  city  benefitted  from  better  planning  and  service  delivery.  The  lowest  tiers  of  society,  the  colonized underprivileged masses, were left in the squalor of poorly built shelters with minimal services,  if  any  at  all.  Colonialism  and  the  entrenchment  of  neoliberal  forces  have  contributed  to  the  further  exclusion, neglect, and marginalization of these informal settlements.   Evidence  of  the  colonial  legacy  appears  in  the  differences  between  upper  and  lower  tiers  of  state  and  society and the social and economic contexts. During the postindependence period, upper tier planning  and  lower  tier  management  tensions  grew,  further  polarizing  service  delivery  along  class  lines.  As  the  wealthy  `Indian  elite'  entrenched  themselves  in  larger  colonial  era  homes  and  newer,  well  planned  developments,  they  maintained  access  to  lower  tier  state  services.  `Iron  networks'  formed  between  upper  tier  state  actors,  wealthier  urbanites,  power  brokers,  developers  and  organized  crime.  These  groups  quickly  exploited  public  goods  and  resources,  concentrating  wealth  in  the  upper  tiers  of  society,  213   

much  in  the  same  way  colonial  rulers  did.  The  result  has  been  the  appropriation  and  concentration  of  public  goods  and  wealth  in  the  hands  of  the  urban  elite.  In  the  absence  of  resources  and  `support'  from  upper  tier  state  actors,  lower  tier  state  actors  have  been  overwhelmed  by  day  to  day  service  delivery  challenges.  Many  lower  tier  state  actors  have  been  reduced  to  serving  the  needs  of  the  urban  elite,  much  in  the  same  way  that  'native  administrator'  did,  during  the  period  of  colonial  rule.  A  culture  of  patronage  influenced  priorities  combined  with  nonexistent  intergovernmental  support  has  permitted  the  weakening  of  municipal  institutions  and  public  departments.  The  informal  settlements,  home  to  a  significant proportion of the informal sector have become further marginalized. Evidence of polarization  between  state  actors  influences  our  understanding  of  the  state.  Namely,  that  the  critical  infrastructure  upon which basic services rely; are not within the interest of the upper tiers of the state to maintain and  develop.  Rather,  although  the  lower  tiers  are  marginalized  and  under  resourced,  their  engagement  is  critical  to  the  resuscitation  of  basic  service  delivery  for  the  urban  poor  and  informal  sector.  More  examination  of  the  shared  ownership  of  public  infrastructure  is  needed  in  the  municipal  scholarship,  to  offset current understandings of state and nonstate interactions.   It  must  be  noted  that  the  polarized  planning  of  developing  country  cities  differentiates  the  former  colonized  state  from  the  western  state.  While  colonized  states  remained  largely  unplanned  through  their  critical  development  periods,  western  states  have  enjoyed  at  least  basic  levels  of  infrastructure  investment and planning. Much of the unplanned infrastructure development in postcolonial states and  cities  was  performed  by  informal  sector  labour  under  the  leadership  of  western  rulers  and  contractors.  The  capacity  to  plan,  operate,  maintain  and  govern  the  'built  infrastructure'  departed  the  region  once  colonial  rulers  left.  What  remained  was  a  dichotomy  between  upper  and  lower  tier  state  actors  which  has persisted to this day. This polarization has quickly grown into the hegemony of the elites vs. the rule  and  services  of  the  people.  Leadership  of  the  urban  elites  has  quickly  consolidated  the  interests  of  the  educated,  privileged  class,  which  has  also  spread  to  nonstate  actors.  Agency  at  the  local  government  level  should  create  a  progressive  and  engaging  policy  and  program  space  within  the  context  of  South  Asia's  mega  cities,  where  street  level  bureaucrats  and  representative  advocates  of  service  delivery  to  all  urban  citizens  can  resuscitate  public  goods  and  service  delivery  infrastructure.  The  postcolonial  city  continues  to  struggle  with  ad  hoc  solutions  to  urban  planning  challenges,  rooted  in  the  relationships  of  colonialism.  In  the  midst  of  these  challenges,  the  supply  of  low  wage  informal  sector  labour  has  provided  the  postcolonial  city  with  ad  hoc  services  ranging  from  solid  waste  collection  to  utility  servicing  and  transportation.  This  supply  has  allowed  upper  tiers  state  actors  to  avoid  dealing  with  the  214   

realities  of  urban  decay  and  deteriorating  service  delivery  levels.  As  a  result,  despite  the  efforts  of  multilateral  organizations,  donor  driven  development  and  private  sector  interests,  equitable  development  has  not  materialized  in  South  Asia's  mega  cities.  As  the  elitist  colonial  structure  was  assumed  by  the  local  elite,  the  deterioration  of  public  infrastructure  continued  unabated.  So,  as  neoliberal policies (which I will return to discussing in the final thematic subsection) have permitted the  maintenance  of  infrastructure  along  class  lines,  we  cannot  consider  planning  and  operational  sustainment in the same way as we do in the western state.   Finally,  the  colonial  legacy  is  reflected  in  the  growing  ruralurban  divide.  Since  colonial  rule,  urban  centers across South Asia have experienced expansion and contraction as part of shifting concentrations  of  political  and  economic  activity.  Since  the  advent  of  market  led  globalization,  South  Asia's  urban  economies  have  been  at  the  fore  of  neoliberalism  inspired  policy  making.  Upper  tier  state  actors  have  encouraged  the  continued,  relentless  expansion  of  urban  economies  while  neglecting  rural  development,  thereby  driving  rural  to  urban  migration.  As  these  neoliberal  policies  are  largely  market  facing,  they  offer  no  support  to  migrant  workers  nor  incentive  for  their  return  to  rural  heartlands.  In  essence  the  fact  that  rural  displacement  leads  to  urban  marginalization  is  a  direct  consequence  of  the  lack  of  attention  to  rural  peasants,  a  legacy  of  colonial  rule.  This  continues  into  the  present,  as  South  Asian  states  have  not  given  sufficient  policy  attention  to  the  development  of  a  coherent  rural  development strategy and instead, benefit from the surplus provided by informal sector workers.  

7.2.3

Success and failure in community based mobilization

In  all  three  mega  cities,  certain  CBOs  have  been  mobilized  by  technically  knowledgeable  NGOs  and  educated  to advocate for services from lower tier state actors. Working together, these CBOs and NGOs  have  sought  to  resuscitate  lower  tier  state  capacities  and  make  service  delivery  more  equitable  across  the  mega  city.  This  is  in  contrast  to  the  view  that  nonstate  actors  (NGOs  primarily)  are  part  of  the  neoliberal  agenda  and  are  seeking  to  'substitute'  for  the  state,  and  pave  the  way  for  the  privatization  of  public  services.  I  do  not  deny  the  constraints  placed  on  development  by  the  'iron  triangles'  of  market,  state and development sector actors. Due to insufficient resources, I have avoided the problematization  of  upper  and  lower  tier  nonstate  actors.  While  the  critical  literatures  provide  ample  insights  into  the  negative  influence  and  'substitution  effects'  of  civil  society,  there  is  still  space  for  representative  civil  society  actors.  Deeper  analysis  of  cross  case  study  evidence  suggests  that  variables  related  to  the  substitution effect are much more complex than current debates submit. For instance, at one level, case  215   

study  evidence  reveals  that  the  neoliberal  agenda  benefits  from  having  NGOs  substitute  for  state  led  service delivery and absorbing the blame for negative outcomes of myopic uppertier state development  activity.  This  is  certainly  the  case  in  Mumbai  where  NGOs  such  as  SPARC  have  implemented  slum  resettlement  plans  on  behalf  of  state  actors  amidst  community  protests  and  criticisms  of  elitist  land  development.  Similarly,  case  study  evidence  also  reveals  that  neoliberalism  spreads  from  the  outsourcing  of  underfunded  public  services  to  the  informal  sector.  This  pattern  of  'offloading'  can  be  found in each of the mega cities where waste collection is carried out by the informal sector and/or NGO  subsidized  market  (albeit  informal)  forces.  Waste  collection  never  recovers  in  these  cases  and  the  market  benefits  from  depressed  levels  of  raw  materials  and  the  expansion  of  informal  supply  chains  which feed the formal sector.  Conversely, research also shows that lowertier functionaries have offset the agendas of uppertier state  actors  by  demonstrating  service  delivery  effectiveness  by  partnering  with  nonstate  actors.  Lowertier  functionaries  are  dependent  on  the  success  of  CBOs  and  NGOs,  which  have  enabled  lower  tier  state  actors  with  information  assets  which  are  key  components  of  infrastructure  extension  (social  maps,  infrastructure  surveys,  local  level  plans  and  neighbourhood  design  documents  developed  through  community  outreach,  education,  social  mapping,  and  internal  infrastructure  surveys).  For  example,  Karachi's  OPP  RTI  has  long  maintained  engineering  maps  and  drawings  that  detail  the  topography,  density,  and  flow  paths  of  sewage  and  storm  water.  Not  only  does  the  OPP  RTI  have  a  comprehensive  collection  of  community  and  neighbourhood  maps,  it  also  maintains  inventories  of  municipally  drafted  plans  and  maps.  These  documents  are  vital  sources  of  information  for  lower  tier  state  functionaries,  who  in  many  instances  are  not  engaged  by  upper  tier  state  actors  in  the  approval,  design  and  implementation  of  infrastructure  plans.  No  doubt,  many  informal  settlements  have  benefited  from  the  clarity  provided  by  such  artefacts,  permitting  the  extension  of  service  delivery  infrastructure.  Nevertheless, market actors have also harnessed the momentum of such cooperation to obtain services.  For  example,  in  Karachi,  the  resources  of  market  facing  CBOs  (representing  the  interests  of  small  and  medium  sized  merchants  no  less)  facilitated  service  delivery  extension  faster  than  any  other  OPP  RTI  case  study  on  record.  This  is  yet  another  facet  of  the  neoliberal  agenda  where  market  forces  adopt  the  guise  of  CBOs  to  better  their  position  in  a  competitive  urban  economy.  OPP  RTI's  retention,  updating,  and  distribution  of  these  maps  that  link  large  city  pipes  with  community  distribution  networks  has  been  a  valuable  resource  for  engagement  with  state  and  nonstate  actors.  Evidence  from  my  research  on  the 

216   

different  roles  and  responsibilities  of  upper  and  lowertier  state  as  well  as  nonstate  actors  reveals  the  complexities surrounding the substitution effect.  Once mobilized, CBOs and their informal settlements have built on service delivery success by expanding  their  capabilities  to  include  other  social  services.  In  many  instances,  they  have  returned  to  their  NGO  counterparts  with  requests  for  assistance  to  initiate  other  programs  such  as  education  and  health.  Both  DSK and OPP have received repeated requests from numerous CBOs for assistance in expanding hygiene  education  programs  to  part  time  and  full  time  education  facilities  (Dhaka  WASA  Kalyanpura  basti,  OPP  RTI  Dhost  Mohammed  Junger  Goth,  SPARC    Dharavi).  The  result  of  repeat  requests  and  open  communication  has  been  the  establishment  of  community  development  networks,  where  knowledge  sharing  on  state  engagement  is  facilitated  in  all  three  mega  cities.  When  formalized  relations  have  been  developed  between  state  actors  and  the  civil  society  community,  it  has  generated  multiple  benefits,  beyond  simply  facilitating  the  integration  of  informal  settlements  into  the  formalized  service  delivery  network  (Dhaka  WASAKorail  basti).  Nonstate  actors  have  also  demonstrated  prowess  in  the  mobilization of lower tier state actors in areas such as housing/shelter and solid waste management.   The  success  of  community  selfhelp  networks  and  the  role  of  nonstate  actors  in  service  delivery  has  shown potential, particularly in the case of Dhaka WASA, when lower tier actors are engaged early in the  development  of  alternative  service  delivery  models.  The  missing  policy  instrument  is  formalized  relationships  (i.e.,  Letters  of  Intent  or  Memorandums  of  Understanding)  between  lower  tier  state  and  nonstate actors. These instruments are missing in the policy frameworks that guide state and nonstate  interaction  (KWSB  in  Karachi  and  the  MCGM  in  Mumbai).  The  absence  of  this  kind  of  instrument  can  be  attributed  to  the  technical  complexity  of  water  and  sanitation  service  delivery,  as  well  as  the  political  variants  of  the  comparator  variables  mentioned  above.  Increasingly  isolated  water  and  sanitation  service providers are less inclined to engage with nonstate actors given the lack of authority, incentives,  and mandate that they have been provided with.   In  Karachi  there  is  little  evidence  of  formalized  engagement  of  state  actors  with  nonstate  actors.  This  has  constrained  the  success  experienced  by  the  OPP  RTI.  The  KWSB  claims  that  a  low  income  wing  actively  engages  Katchi  Abadis  and  Goths,  but  the  reality  is  that  the  mapping,  surveying,  and  construction  of  infrastructure  has  been  facilitated  to  a  large  part  by  the  OPP  RTI  and  its  community  development  network.  Many  nonstate  actors  have  questioned  the  KWSB's  claim  that  sufficient  supply  is  provided  to  informal  settlements.  Interviews  with  state  and  nonstate  actors  yielded  different  217   

accounts  of  service  support  and  billing  issues.  Undoubtedly,  there  is  potential  for  cooperation  between  the KWSB and representative CBOs, but the will to formalize such arrangements is not forthcoming. This  is  in  contrast  to  the  example  set  by  the  `one  window'  efforts  of  the  SKAA.  This  provincial  body  embedded itself in low income settlements and facilitated the allocation of land to homeless migrants. It  also furnished the informal sector with materials, utility connections, and social services programs.    In  Mumbai,  engagement  of  nonstate  actors  has  been  constrained  as  engagement  occurs  after  plans  have  failed.  Policy  research  has  revealed  the  existence  of  provisions  for  low  income  groups,  but  there  is  little  evidence  that  support  actually  reaches  them  (SPARC,  2010).  This  has  been  the  case  with  the  pavement and slum dwellers with regard to housing and shelter service. Like many other cities, Mumbai  has  implemented  state  based  toilet  blocks  through  the  Maharashtra  Housing  and  Development  Authority  (MHADA)  (PACIDRC,  2012).  Mumbai  has  also  implemented  community  based  public  toilet  programs  where  local  groups  are  charged  with  managing  and  maintaining  community  toilets  (Burra,  et  al.,  2003).  However,  manipulation  and  imbalances  in  statecivil  society  engagement  have  led  to  limited  efficiencies in waste collection (De Wit, 2010).  

7.2.4

Need for decentralized governance

The  continued failure of  top down policy and program delivery  models (coopted by  neoliberal thinking)  highlights  the  urgency  of  the  fourth  theme:  the  need  for  decentralized  governance  arrangements  that  enable lower tier state actors to engage recipient communities. All three case studies revealed the need  for  resourcing  at  the  lower  tiers  of  state  (and  society)  to  ensure  that  positive  service  delivery  outcomes  can  be  sustained  across  informal  settlements.  This  kind  of  approach  can  lead  to  a  marked  shift  in  urban  development,  where  equity  in  service  delivery  (or  rights  to  services)  is  prioritized  rather  than  simply  the  completion  of  infrastructure  projects.  The  case  studies  demonstrated  the  value  of  employing  nonstate  actors  as  facilitators  of  informal  settlement  engagement  with  autonomous  lower  tier  state  actors.  In  contrast  to  this  them,  development  studies  research  suggests  that  decentralization  models  have  failed  and  policymakers  should  be  focusing  on  centralized  systems.  My  findings  indicate  that  the  failure  of  decentralization  models  is  implicitly  linked  to  the  persistence  of  upper  tier  interference  in  lower  tier  service delivery and program implementation. For instance, in each community, upper tier development  authorities  (RAJUK,  KDA  and  the  MMRDA)  dictated  capital  and  operational  resource  flows  for  lower  tier  water  and  sanitation  utility  operations.  The  tension  between  the  two  (capital  project  funding  within  the  hands  of  the  upper  tiers  and  operational  budget  pressure  on  the  lower  tiers),  needs  to  be  examined  in  218   

terms  of  lower  tier  sustainability  and  selfsufficiency.  The  shortsightedness  of  'project  centric'  and  'donor  driven'  decision  making  must  be  challenged.  For  instance,  upper  tier  elites  are  likely  to  find  different  ways  to  extract  funds  from  a  weak  utility,  but  if  the  utility  fails  and  work  is  contracted  out  to  the private sector, all local stakeholders lose out. Let us briefly compare these factors in and across each  mega city.   In  Karachi,  the  facilitating  role  played  by  OPP  RTI  in  partnership  with  CBOs  was  eventually  seen  as  a  risk  to  the  `votes  for  services'  and  'illegal  hydrant'  revenue  streams  of  elected  officials.  The  result  was  PPP  party  thugs  intimidating  residents  to  discontinue  their  support  for  the  KWSB  and  KMC  infrastructure  extension  (Ghazi  Goth).  In  this  context,  decentralized  governance  models  would  ensure  that  any  infrastructure  connections  made  to  informal  settlements  were  established  using  formalized  plans,  offsetting  the  influences  of  party  `activists'  and  'thugs'.  This  form  of  urban  development  is  distinct  from  top  down  models,  because  service  delivery  access  starts  with  the  engagement  of  lower  tier  actors,  and  avoids  upper  tier  actors,  elected  officials  and  vested  interests.  The  community  mobilization  of  merchants  and  households  in  Dost  Muhammed  Jungar  Goth  was  seamless  once  the  OPP  RTI  was  involved.  According  to  OPP  RTI  staff,  it  was  easy  to  obtain  access  to  KWSB  infrastructure,  given  the  overwhelming  social  and  economic  support  from  the  informal  settlement.  In  fact,  the  focused  public  anger  and  pressure  for  services  counter  balanced  criminal  elements  that  were  charging  rents  for  water  and  prompting  ethnic  discord  in  the  multi  ethnic  community.  This  had  obvious  effects  on  improving  statesociety relations.   In  Dhaka,  DSK  helped  organize  and  educate  the  CBOs  of,  enabling  them  to  sustain  some  levels  of  local  water  and  sanitation  infrastructure  while  pressuring  DWASA  for  official  connections  (Kalyanpura  Basti  and  Korail).  DWASA  has  since  grown  increasingly  autonomous  and  is  now  leveraging  the  grass  roots  engagement  of  nonstate  actors  to  mobilize  CBOs  for  service  connections.  Staff  members  at  DWASA  realized  that  land  ownership  struggles  were  not  part  of  their  corporate  mandate,  but  they  were  willing  to  overlook  outdated  land  claims  and  bureaucratic  processes  in  order  to  extend  service  connections  to  informal  settlements  and  recover  lost  revenue  through  illegal  pilferage.  In  Kalyanpura  Basti,  the  repeated  resettlement  of  the  community  despite  three  separate  evictions  illustrates  the  cohesion  and  common  identity  of  otherwise  diverse  ethnic  groups  of  migrant  labourers.  A  number  of  pro  poor  programs  are  also  being  resuscitated  to  meet  housing  and  shelter  needs:  donors  and  civil  society  actors  are  encouraging  reluctant  DCC  slum  departments  to  facilitate  the  provision  of  services  by  civil  society  219   

actors  for  pavement  dweller  centres.  The  engagement  of  lower  tier  state  actors  by  lower  tier  nonstate  actors  illustrates  the  existence  of  processes  through  which  services  can  be  extended  to  informal  settlements.  This  kind  of  community  engagement  has  helped  forge  new  community  and  political  identities for certain informal settlements and their residents.  Little  evidence  of  accountability  or  transparency  measures  was  found  in  Mumbai.  At  the  lower  tier,  there was no evidence of regular reporting by the MCGM on water supply, storm water management, or  sanitation.  More  concerning  is  the  lack  of  clear  accountability  and  transparency  at  the  upper  tiers  of  government,  where  resource  decisions  are  made.  The  1995  floods  that  inundated  Mumbai  drew  harsh  criticisms  about  policy,  specifically  regarding  the  lack  of  municipal  capacity  to  respond,  and  delayed  support  from  the  state  and  central  government,  who  hold  the  majority  of  resources.  In  many  ways,  this  simply  perpetuates  reliance  on  the  centre,  rather  than  empowering  the  periphery.  A  number  of  the  constraints  imposed  by  upper  tier  actors  are  related  to  linkages  with  the  criminal  underground.  In  the  absence  of  sufficient  levels  of  state  service  delivery,  a  shadow  economy  has  emerged,  supplying  informal  settlements  with  costly  and  poor  quality  services.  With  no  access  to  piped  water,  informal  settlements (slums) are forced to pay local slum lords for the illegal supply of contaminated water (at 10  to  15  times  the  municipal  tariff).  This  contaminated  water  has  resulted  in  the  spread  of  gastro  intestinal  diseases.  As  a  result,  informal  sector  workers  suffer  from  frequent  bouts  of  illness  that  prevents  them  from working enough to pay for the high costs of other services: the cycle of impoverishment as a result  of  poor  service  delivery  continues.  This  shadow  economy  has  also  exploited  an  environment  of  rising  land values, leading to pro poor schemes and projects being taken over by higher income groups.   Many  researchers  have  referred  to  corruption  at  the  lower  tiers  of  the  state  as  the  root  cause  of  unresponsive service delivery to the informal sector (OPP RTI, 2008; SPARC, 2010). However, my findings  suggest  that  the  problem  is  rooted  in  the  role  played  by  the  upper  tiers  of  the  state  as  well  as  `elites'  who  have  amassed  wealth  and  power  at  the  expense  of  weakened,  public  facing,  lower  tier  institutions.  These  drivers  are  clearly  linked  to  the  unleashing  of  market  forces  as  part  of  historical,  neoliberal  policy  designs,  which  I  have  already  discussed  in  the  earlier  chapters  and  subsection.  As  NGOs  and  CBOs  have  intervened  in  these  arrangements,  they  have  been  targeted  by  organized  crime:  OPP  RTI  and  DSK  staff  have  received  death  threats  on  more  than  one  occasion,  where  the  power  of  slum  lords  far  outweighs  state  structures  and  civil  society  intervention.  In  a  related  vein,  critics  are  correct  in  accusing  larger  `upper  tier  NGOs'  of  being  coopted  by  market  actors  and  engaged  solely  in  meeting  profit  taking  220   

mandates.  However,  my  research  highlights  the  difference  between  these  'upper  tier  NGOs'  and  'lower  tier  NGOs'  who  are  embedded  and  engaged  with  informal  settlements  and  their  representatives.  Many  critics  have  argued  that  the  latter  are  in  competition  with  the  state  and  desire  to  substitute  state  machinery with nonstate models: this  assumption is in need of reexamination. My research recognizes  that  'upper  tier  NGOs'  operate  within  the  neoliberal  paradigm  and  in  some  ways  attempt  to  substitute  for the functions of the state. However, evidence across all mega cities reveals that a more technocratic,  selfhelp  oriented  groups  of  NGOs  is  active  in  partnering  with  CBOs,  representing  the  interests  of  informal settlements. This group is the most effective in mobilizing communities to engage the state.  Finally,  although  CBOs  supplement  capabilities  across  informal  settlements,  their  objective  has  been  to  resuscitate  lower  tier  capacities  rather  than  substitute  for  them.  There  is  a  demonstrated  willingness  to  pay,  from  lower  income  groups  as  compared  to  their  upper  income  counterparts.  Models  are  based  on  community capacity and capability, in light of available resources and the will to meet a diverse group of  needs. Global, national, and local forms of capitalist development in the late 20th and early 21st century  have  introduced  new  actors  at  the  global  and  local  levels.  These  actors  (civil  society,  private,  etc.)  have  unleashed  a  distinctive  mode  of  governance  at  the  local  level  that  is  effectively  autonomous  or  semi autonomous.  Organized  crime  and  an  informal  economy  have  occupied  this  local  space,  ensuring  that  it  remains  outside  the  jurisdiction  of  the  state.  Over  time,  these  actors  have  shaped  urban  society:  autonomous,  nonstate  actor  led  interventions  within  informal  settlements  are  sustaining  a  minimal  level  of  support  to  the  informal  sector,  despite  conditions  of  exclusion  and  deprivation.  As  a  result,  the  informal sector is able to serve the formal sector as hyper exploited inhabitants of the city. To revive and  rehabilitate  the  informal  sector,  in  so  far  as  their  habitation  of  informal  settlements  is  concerned,  a  partnership between nonstate actors and lower tier state actors is required to address this weakness in  service  delivery  governance.  I  argue  that  at  this  lower  tier  of  nonstate  activity,  there  is  no  substitution  effect,  rather  there  is  an  opportunity  for  decentralized  governance  models.  Both  case  studies  from  Dhaka  illustrate  the  strengths  of  facilitating  state  service  delivery,  while  those  in  Karachi  and  to  a  lesser  extent  Mumbai  reveal  what  may  emerge  in  the  absence  of  strong  lower  tier  state  actors.  CBOs  and  NGOs complement state services and reveal the need for lower tier state autonomy.  There  is  an  opportunity  to  explore  and  theorize  the  role  of  the  state  in  so  far  as  engaging  urban  society  through  service  delivery  provision.  Evidence  reveals  the  ossified  condition  of  colonial  era  policies  towards  urban  centers  and  even  mega  cities,  despite  their  size  and  complexity.  The  state's  lack  of  221   

willingness  to  provide  for  urban  society,  through  decentralization  and  financial  support/revenue  redistribution,  simply  strengthens  the  argument  that  the  state  chooses  to  benefit  from  the  social  and  economic  polarization  of  urban  society.  In  other  words,  the  informal  sector  and  informal  settlements  assure  the  state  of  the  provision  of  a  steady  supply  of  flexible  labour  for  various  modes  of  production.  The  spread  of  capitalism  across  urban  centers,  despite  the  human  development  arguments  and  isolated  successes  of  CBOs,  will  continue  unabated  until  there  is  sufficient  resistance  to  the  deteriorating  conditions  surrounding  the  informal  sector.  An  enabling  environment,  may  very  well  emerge  from  cooperation  between  informal  settlements  and  street  level  bureaucrats  whose  social  location  within  marginalized  lower  tier  institutions  benefits  from  broader  civic  engagement.  The  right  to  the  city  needs  to include the role of lower tier actors in the rehabilitation and resuscitation of informal settlements and  the condition of the urban poor. 

7.2.5

The growing rural-urban divide and the neoliberal

policies of an absent state
Colonialism  has  left  a  deep  impression  on  South  Asia's  urban  societies.  The  earliest  marks  of  this  impression  can  be  traced  to  the  dismantling  of  the  governance  structures  and  administrative  systems  that remained from precolonial Mughal rule. The selective resuscitation of political structures (the Jirga  and panchayat systems of local governance) by colonial rulers points to the resilience of these otherwise  precolonial  forms  of  decision  making.  Colonial  rulers  were  more  concerned  with  the  economic  configuration  of  India,  so  as  to  maximize  the  flow  of  resources,  especially  tribute  collection,  to  the  British  Isles.  The  somewhat  arbitrary  transferrals  of  regional  power  from  district  to  district  and  city  to  city  reoriented  the  centers  of  political  and  economic  decision  making  with  reverberating  consequences  for  urban  development  in  the  decades  that  followed.  Urban  centers  experienced  surges  of  economic  growth  and  weak  infrastructure  buckled  under  the  overwhelming  and  spontaneous  flows  of  commerce  and  trade.  Urban  infrastructure  and  the  carrying  capacity  of  cities  was  overwhelmed  by  accelerated  economic  development  and  an  inflow  of  people.  This  was  further  complicated  by  the  displacement  of  rural  labourers  and  their  migration  to  urban  centers.  For  example,  as  development  models  experienced  modernization,  industrialization  and  economic  intensification,  more  rural  workers  were  driven  to  urban  centers. The reasons were also in response to poorly formulated rural policies. The green revolution saw  larger  land  holdings  benefit  from  irrigation  technology,  mechanization  (introduction  of  tractors)  and  downward  pressure  on  wage  labour.  The  neoliberal  shift  and  economic  attention  given  to  urban  222   

markets  was  enough  to  draw  marginalized  migrant  labour  from  rural  areas  towards  urban  centers  in  search  of  employment.  Unfortunately,  this  pool  of  migrant  labourers  would  not  be  embraced  by  the  urban centers of attention, rather they would struggle to find livelihood in a flexible labour force with no  support  or  benefits.  The  primacy  of  urban  market  led  development,  mirrored  by  a  consistent  neglect  of  rural communities, continued well beyond the period of independence.  The period following regional independence (India followed by Pakistan and Bangladesh) was marked by  a  continued  widening  of  the  gap  between  rural  and  urban  development  priorities.  Each  country  was  eager  to  demonstrate  its  sovereign  ability  to  develop  and  as  a  result,  economic  and  political  power  was  concentrated  in  urban  centers.  Embracing  progress  and  modernity  drove  the  policy  narratives  surrounding  independence  as  each  country  sought  recognition  on  the  international  stage.  These  policy  priorities  were  intimately  linked  with  industry  and  commerce.  By  tipping  the  policy  scales  permanently  in  favour  of  market  led  development,  the  postcolonial  state  had  effectively  picked  up  where  colonial  rulers  had  left  off.  Rural  areas  and  agricultural  sectors  were  increasingly  seen  as  signs  of  'developing  economies'  and  multilateral  institutions  (Bretton  Woods)  encouraged  the  young  nations  to  embrace  modern  manufacturing  sectors  and  export  led  development.  These  neoliberal  policies  benefited  from  the  continuous  supply  of  informal  sector  labour  that  had  surged  due  to  the  displacement  of  rural  wage  workers.   Although  the  postcolonial  state  has  been  active  in  promoting  neoliberal  policies,  it  has  been  absent  from the policy discussions emerging from rising levels of informality. Corporations and large businesses  have clearly benefitted from the economic growth and competitive advantage underpinned by low wage  labour.  Civil  society  actors,  referred  to  as  the  'development  industry',  have  long  been  criticized  for  simply  facilitating  the  perpetuation  of  neoliberal  thinking  without  advocating  for  social  change.  The  unquestioned  continuation  of  neoliberal  policy  thinking  is  arguably  evidence  of  the  resilience  of  the  'blurred lines' between state, market and civil society actors. The developing, postcolonial economy has  been  able  to  maintain  a  niche  in  the  global  marketplace  in  part,  due  to  the  ready  supply  of  informal  sector  labour  to  industry  (textiles,  manufacturing  and  services).  However,  the  condition  of  labour  and  the  exploitative  relationship  with  capitalists  has  gone  unaddressed.  As  a  result,  South  Asia's  cities  are  the  sites  of  the  greatest  economic  disparities  on  the  planet.  The  elite  of  urban  South  Asia's  posh  enclaves  reside  a  short  distance  from  the  most  marginalized  living  conditions  in  the  region's  urban 

223   

informal  settlements.  The  developing  state  must  intervene  to  reverse  the  trend  of  continued  social  and  economic polarization  At  this  juncture  I  should  point  out  that  I  do  not  intend  to  unpack  the  implications  of  neoliberalism  for  the  developing  state  or  mega  city.  Rather,  I  am  simply  acknowledging  the  role  that  neoliberal  forces  are  playing in polarizing urban state and society. However, we must face the reality that as these mega cities  expand, the need for the most basic of services will be central to any establishment of order. Otherwise,  marginalized  communities  among  others  will  be  the  sites  of  conflict  as  competition  for  resources  disrupts  urban  life.  We  must  face  the  reality  that  as  these  mega  cities  expand,  the  need  for  basic  services  on  the  ground  in  the  most  marginalized  communities  will  be  the  site  of  conflict  and  class  divided.  What  is  needed  is  for  the  state  to  ensure  the  equal  and  equitable  delivery  of  these  services  in  ways  through  community  based  organizations.    Polarization  of  state  and  society  has  happened  as  a  result  of  the  regions  colonial  history.  However,  neoliberal  theorists  musts  acknowledge  the  polarization  of the state in terms of structure and interests, rather than taking a strong antistate view and assuming  as  Harvey  has  rightly  indicated,  that  all  state  actors  benefit  equally  from  the  spread  of  capitalism  and  accumulation  by  dispossession.  In  reality,  neoliberalism  has  removed  the  constraints  of  state  instruments    but  to  what  extent  and  for  what  outcome  in  so  far  as  mega  city  services  are  concerned?  The  dismantling  of  state  apparatus  through  colonialism,  and  concentration  of  power  at  the  levels  of  central government have only marginalized groups and through crises have redistributed wealth into the  hands of the elites. However, it does not account for the role of lower tier state actors.   Despite the segregation of developing societies along class lines, much of the critical literature treats the  `developing  state'  as  a  homogenous  structure.  My  findings  demonstrate  how  developing  states  are  divided  into  upper  and  lower  tiers,  where  functionaries  have  distinct  social  and  economic  characteristics. Upper tier actors concentrated and contained policy capacity and control within national  and  provincial/state  levels  of  government,  while  their  lower  tier  counterparts  inherited  expanding  jurisdictions  of  responsibility  without  the  necessary  resources  or  decision  making  authority.  Presently,  the upper tier cadre of civil service bureaucrats compete for high profile postings, far removed from the  realities of program implementation and frontline service delivery. Lower tier departments and frontline  offices face stiff competition (and staff turnover) from private sector actors. The result has been a social  and  cultural  divide  between  upper  tier  policy  capacities  and  lower  tier  program  capabilities.  In  each 

224   

mega  city,  upper  tier  state  actors  (mainly  development  authorities)  continue  to  impose  flawed  planning  models on lower tier departments.   In  light  of  these  emerging  themes  there  is  a  need  to  realign  capacities  and  capabilities  to  support  bottomup  basic  needs  provision  and  human  development.  Across  all  mega  cities,  elitists  influence  capital  development  planners  who  in  turn  overlook  the  bylaw  enforcement,  codes,  operations,  and  maintenance  concerns  of  lower  tier  departments.  Upper  tier  state  actors  (KDA,  MMRDA  and  RAJUK)  rarely  take  into  account  the  needs  of  lower  tier  state  actors  (KMC,  MCGM  and  DCC)  and  their  operating  realities.    Many  donors,  researchers,  and  administrative  development  analysts  consider  a  lack  of  coordination  between  horizontally  situated  departments  (electricity  utilities,  land  control,  and  water  utilities)  as  the  root  of  management  inefficiencies  (Satterthwaite  et  al,  2011).  Functionaries  can  distribute  services  to  those  who  can  access  them,  but  risk  the  integrity  of  the  system  if  the  institutional  credibility  collapses.  It  is  no  surprise  that  many  stakeholders  from  the  public,  academic,  and  private  sectors  have  called  for  institutional  reforms  in  these  mega  cities.144  These  calls  range  from  political  to  administrative  functionaries  at  the  upper  tiers  of  the  state  to  the  most  distant  CBOs  of  overseas  diaspora.  Some  foreign  scholars  have  argued  for  sector  by  sector  privatization,  to  facilitate  capital  investment  into  urban  centres  (McKinsey,  2001).  Local  scholars  have  called  for  increased  decentralization  and  deconcentration  of  power  to  lower  tier  actors,  to  encourage  and  fund  the  engagement  of  neighbourhood  level  state  and  nonstate  actors  (Siddiqui  et  al.,  1998).  Others  have  argued  for  the  need  to  decentralize  authority  to  the  local  levels  of  government  and  remove  the  `unrepresentative'  context  of  upper  tier  interference  in  mega  city  governance  and  decision  making  (Kundu,  2011).  All  of  these  calls  share  one  assumption:  political  actors  are  the  most  effective  agents  of  service  delivery  transformation.  My  findings  across  the  various  service  delivery  contexts  challenge  this  assumption.  The preceding analysis reveals opportunities and threats to service delivery to informal settlements. The  main  gaps  are  in  intergovernmental  support,  where  well  networked  land  grabbers  and  powerful  water                                                                    
144

 Some political parties have grown in popularity by simply calling for the depoliticisation of service delivery machinery. While such an  approach is perhaps unfeasible, it highlight the popularity of the notion within sufficient segments of the electorate. 

225   

mafias  are  appropriating  public  goods.  Lower  tier  actors  fear  elites  and  upper  tier  retribution  for  any  changes  to  the  status  quo:  the  few  managers  who  are  eager  for  change  see  no  benefit  in  speaking  out.  Capital  intensive  donor  projects  have  been  shown  to  not  work;  instead,  state  and  nonstate  actors  should  explore  initiatives  that  promote  institutional  reform,  strengthening  service  delivery  equitably  to  all  formal  and  informal  settlements.  CBO  efforts,  strengthened  by  economic  interests  (Dost  Muhammed  Jungar Goth and Korail Basti), can improve water and sanitation services and decrease pilferage of water  supplies.  However,  in  other  cases,  the  absence  of  consensus  and  the  antagonistic  relations  between  upper and lower tier state actors prevents services from being extended. In this kind of situation, (Ghazi  Goth,  Korail  and  Dharavi)  community  interests  are  no  match  for  party  politics  and  provincial/municipal  jurisdictional disputes, so it is important to appreciate the limited capacity of nonstate actors.

OPP Timeline of Reported Milestones 

Reported Events AHK consolidates planning resources and maps obtained from KDA planners and NIPA offices, where the OPP was initially to be situated. He also documents the inadequacy of engagement between institutional actors and citizens of Orangi. Low cost sanitation model begins Health and family planning, women entrepreneurs and family enterprise begins Low cost housing begins KMC consults OPP RTI on an ADB funded sewage project and advice to SKAA continues as well. Loans from foreign agencies are given to family run and women run enterprises and informal sector businesses with most loans repaid. Transparency is shown and the names of defaulters published. Low cost housing and sanitation lines established with benefits of engaging local materials suppliers reported. By engaging and upgrading the existing machinery of poor housing development, rapid returns experienced with little state process delays. Replications in Shikarpur, Sukkur, Lahore and Hyderabad. External and internal components laid in various Karachi and outside projects with public officials from police as well as KDA offering support in permits for lines to be laid for water and sewage infrastructure. Social and technical assistance provided across Karachi, Lahore, Hyderabad and Sukkur. Failure of KDA and HBFC documented as insufficient in providing housing for the poor. Training and education of donors, state officers, journalists and academics increases. Documentation and communication between state and community actors increases. More colonies and settlements across urban areas engaged with some intervention on demolition cessation coming from the ministers who had visited OPP partner NGOs. More engagement with the KMC on project reviews such as donor funded project work, specifically the ADB. KMC and KWSB projects with donors receive some consultation from OPP RTI. Coordinating meetings with SKAA and KMC on housing and sanitation lines work and ensuring quality assurance. Detailed profiles of candidate colonies and katchi abadis in need of support is disclosed. Sukkur consultancy stops as approach deemed too different from OPP RTI model Increased training and work with SKAA on OPP approach across Karachi. Savings in the order of 15 to 30% documented as a result of simplified designs and low cost solutions and models. Issues with loans mitigated through pre-screening with legitimate CBOs and affiliates. OPP stopped loans for a few years and is putting more emphasis on recovery rather than simply finding loans to give out. More technical training and entrepreneurial support in surrounding urban settlements. Intense Collaboration with SKAA continues with work being done in several settlements and Goths, planning, external water and components being developed and implemented with minimal issues. Issues with OCT trust and micro enterprise continue to badger the OPP and stalls on new loans continue. Work in SWAT, Lodhran, Rawalpindi and Faisalabad continues with more work with government staff from municipal agencies, mainly local WASAs. KWSB engaged throughout Karachi on work being contracted out and inspections regularly being done by OPP RTI and KMC and KWSB staff. Manzour colony is an interesting case of constraint, where state officers refuse to demolish houses and contractor pressure has led to design changes to save and pocket money by contractors, state officials, etc. This supports the OPP RTI initiative of keeping project costs low, to avoid the presence of greed and corrupt practice. Research and study of the KWSB dependence on loans and its corrupt practices are published in a report. Work in various abadis continues along with advice to SKAA, KMC and DMCs on implementation of development planning. Work with KWSB has exposed the donor driven and consultant oriented agendas of outsourced planning and engineering, which amounts to several million rupees for unfinished work. Low cost model is now being replicated by CDGK, PKAUI and other donor and state authorities including NGOs and CBOs. Advisory services for KWSB SIII is continuing. Surveys and documentation are also increasing with state officials and SKAA, KMC and CDGK. More Goths based work being done as well as on nalas and the construction of box drains to protect open sewage from spilling into the streets.

KWSB and OPP RTI Â­ Issues and Opportunities 
Issues While the shared roles are appreciated, there is disagreement on the pipe that has been laid by the OPP RTI and communities vs. pipe laid by KWSB. KWSB claim that larger customers are carrying the burden of bill payments, while the poor complain of low pressure and are getting away with not paying. They claim that the poor receive better service than other neighborhoods. The OPP claim that the KWSB needs to address illegally operating tankers and the hydrants they pilfer water from. OPP RTI Quality of Work Low Pressure Illegal pilferage No Comment Lack of capacity Policy Research

KWSB staff members are not as forthcoming on how to deal with illegal hydrants and the lack of police security for KWSB inspectors and field personnel. KWSB staff also admit to not being able to understand its own limitations, for which reason they have engaged civil society members through the URC in efforts to open dialogue with communities that are under serviced. Policy KWSB staff point to the knowledge generated by donors and institutes studying the Research KWSB context for knowledge retention. The response by the KWSB to such engagement is telling of its position on retaining Lack of some functional integrity and responsibility for infrastructure and yet, admitting to its capacity shortcomings in being able to engage lower income communities.

Recommendation

McKinsey recommendations on Mumbai 
Specific Implementation Considerations

Make MMRDA MPC combination work

While the amendment of the Indian Constitution in 1992 recognized local government as a constitutional entity, a large city like Mumbai requires that it have a metropolitan planning committee (MPC). This has not happened as the MMRDA already exists. The municipal commissioner (MCGM) and the state government standing committee (MMRDA) are often always at odds regarding the state of planning, which results in a lot of delays, reversed decisions and not much planning initiative (Pinto, M., 2008; Ruet, J. et al, 2009). The MPC, as per the constitution, should in preparing the draft development plan, inter alia have regard to 'matters of common interest between municipalities and the panchayats, including coordinated physical planning of the area, sharing of water and other physical and natural resources, the integrated development of infrastructure and environmental conservation'. The MMRDA is not likely performing any of these more operational and inclusive responsibilities at functions (Phatak and Patel, 2005). While the 74th constitution has tried to empower lower tier municipalities away from the process freeze and wrangling of state government politics, it failed due to pressure and resistance from state governments. While the pressures to decentralize continue, they are still far from achieving autonomy from even the largest administrative units, namely the MCGM (Pinto, 2009). Demarcate responsibilities of municipal authorities and ULBs The constitution envisages that municipalities be self-governing, however the state government has not assigned functions listed in the twelfth section and rather, the state government has retained most of these functions with itself. The government can make changes to the DP without reference to the local authority. The following all took place among the initiatives of the state government and under its dominance (Phatak and Patel, 2005). (Slum rehabilitation authority scheme (1995), (Changes in FSI for redevelopment of cessed buildings (1999), (Alterations in DCR regarding redevelopment of textile mills (2001) Article 243S indicates that ward committees in larger cities should have devolution of powers and functions, however in Mumbai the 16 ward committees have not been constituted nor have they received discernable functions (Phatak and Patel, 2005). Accelerate internal generation of funds through land monetization and PPP. Need cascading plans and for starters, a concept plan that can be binding on development plans

MPC should house the development plan

Make the city self-governing

Devolution of power to specific departments and municipal capacities

Such an approach might work, but at the level of the local government, there are many departments at work. As related to the previous point on cascading development plants, there is One urban development department Two secretaries (one town planning and one municipal administration) Department of housing Department of water supply and sanitation Department of industries Department of environment.

239   

Install a modified mayor commissioner for all corporations in the region and corporatize key services such as MCGM and TMC. The current system is derived from colonial rule, where the system gave elected councillors a voice in civic affairs, while the real power remained in the hands of a government appointed officer, in this case, the commissioner of the state (Phatak and Patel, 2005). There is a need for decentralized governance that engages all stakeholders, state and nonstate and allows for a participatory process of planning and consensus based collaboration among units of governance. This should also include ward committees, the litmus test of real political power being devolved. Unfortunately at present, the state still hangs onto administrative, fiscal and economic power, avoiding its decentralization (Phatak and Patel, 2005). The caveat in Phatak and Patel's analysis is that they base the recommendation on the ability of stakeholders to collectively look for the greater good rather than fall into rational and selfserving political positions, as often takes place in city governments where council has more authority and lacks the guidance from higher orders of the state [1]. The Kolkota model, where the state commissioner works for the elected mayor and represents the state's interests, may work, and create a three tiered system, where checks and balances are also engaging of state government mandates (Phatak and Patel, 2005). Phatak and Patel point to the mayor in council model that is held in Vancouver as well as Toronto. However, fragmented agendas between left and right leaning members has paralyzed any creative decision making from some time in both jurisdictions, thereby questioning the role of such a model or its effectiveness, without a long term vision. Regular Budget Install a capital investment program of $7.3 billion per annum from MMRDA.
