Abstract
Traffic accidents cause a huge loss to the society. According to statistics, 50% oj all accidents occur at urban intersections and 47% of these are due to left-tum collisions. Countermeasure implementation at these locations therefore can play a vital role in improvement of traffic safety. This study illustrates a methodology for evaluation of urban 4-legged signalize( intersections treated with left-tum priority phasing. The methodology is applied to thre( important collisions types; those due to left-tum collisions; those due to left-tum sid( impact collisions; and all impact types combined collisions. Data used in this analysi: were obtained from the City of Toronto. Safety Performance Functions for left-tum an( all impact types combined collisions which were developed by the City of Toronto, wen calibrated and used in an empirical Bayesian methodology that was employed to estimatl

the expected frequency of accidents occurring at each intersection in order to evaluate the effectiveness of left-turn priority phasing in reducing this frequency. The results revealed that left-turn priority phasing can be an effective treatment for addressing and reducing the number of collisions at signalized intersections. Flashing advance green phasing is more effective in improving safety for two of three types; all left-turn and all impact types combined collisions. Left-turn green arrow

(protected/permissive) phasing is more effective for left-turn side impact collisions. By implementing this type of treatment, the number of crashes and the associated monetary loss to society could be significantly reduced.

INTRODUCTION

Transportation Engineering plays a very important role in daily life all over the world. Of
III transportation modes, highway and road transportation are some of the most reliable bases for

nass movement in both North America and Europe. This mass movement activity is supported >y a worldwide road network. Because of the huge demand for transportation, it has become lecessary to implement the highest possible range of safe and efficient road networks. The safety of roads is of growing interest for traffic engineers, politicians, and for the )ublic at large. Between the years 1998 to 2001, in the province of Ontario, there was an average )f225,119 accidents, out of which 151,835 accidents per annum occurred on urban roads (MTO
~eport,

2001). The magnitude of this loss to society is evident when considering the equivalents

n dollar amounts. In 1994 in Ontario, the cost of each death was estimated at $831,429, each njury at $20,084, and each property damage only (PDO) accident at $ 6,136. The authorities responsible for safety on the road system must be able to identify sites that have an unusually high rate of accident occurrence and to apply limited budgets rationally to safety improvements at the sites that are most likely to give the largest safety gain for the dollars spent. Many agencies have developed practices and standards addressing a broad range of road safety considerations involving the vehicle, the driver, and the road. The ultimate goal of these practices and standards is to promote public safety by reducing transportation related deaths, injuries, and property damage. The most fundamental step in improving safety is determining which sites are truly hazardous. New techniques (e.g., empirical Bayesian (EB) using accident prediction models) incorporate geometric, traffic, and accident history, along with regression models, to analyze the safety of any given site with respect to the number of expected accidents. Empirical Bayesian (EB) estimates may be used to rank potential sites according to the expected number of treatable

accidents and to identify the sites that are likely to respond favourably to safety engineering treatments. EB estimates are also useful in before-after studies to evaluate the safety effect of treatments (Hauer, 1997) and it is this application that is the focus of this research. The objective of this study was to use the EB methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of left-tum priority phasing in the City of Toronto. Three types of accidents were investigated. The first type is those that occur because of all types of left-tum collisions. The second type of accident is left-tum side impact (one vehicle turning left collides with vehicle coming from the opposite direction, going through), and the third is all impact types. For the purposes of this study, fatal injury and severe injury collisions were considered. Property damage only (PDO) accidents were excluded. This thesis constitutes the following: · Introduction: Chapter 1 provides a preface and an introduction to the safety related scenario. It deals with the objective of the research study. · Literature Review: Chapter 2 summarizes the literature review conducted on the evaluation of safety treatment effectiveness by the before-after study using different methods and with emphasis on the EB methodology. A literature review on accident prediction models is also included in this chapter. · Data: Chapter 3 details the data collected and used in this study. Sources and types of data are explained in detail. Missing data relating to average annual daily traffic (AADT) and data that were not available are estimated.

LITERATURE REVIEW

The safety of an entity (intersection, road segment, driver, etc.) is the number of crashes, or crash consequences, by kind and severity, expected to occur to the entity during a specified period (Hauer, 1997). This research mainly exammes the safety effect of left-turn priority signal phasing treatments at urban intersections. Hence, to arrive at the primary objective, a thorough literature review has been conducted on previous work relating to safety analysis and implementation of countermeasures by different researchers. This literature review has been structured in the following manner:

·

The Before - After Study: Reviews the before-after study, estimation of expected number of accidents, accident prediction models and estimation of the index of effectiveness.

·

Left-tum collisions at intersections: Reviews information about collisions at intersections due to left-turn, treatment of collisions during left-tum and left-tum priority signal phasing. A brief summary is presented at the end of this section showing how this research aims to

bridge the gaps identifying in the literature review.

2.1

The Before - After Study
This section provides an overview of the techniques for conducting safety evaluations for

roadway countermeasures. The most common method for evaluating the effectiveness of safety treatment is the simple observational before-after study; this consists of comparing the accident count for the before period of an intersection or road segment (entity) to the accident count for the after period. Hauer (1988) pointed out that the before-after study compares two statistical

estimates, an estimate of the expected number of accidents after the countermeasure improvement program is implemented and the number of accidents that would have b( expected if the treatment had not been implemented. This approach is also supported thrOl research by Griffin (1989 and 1992). The before-after study using a comparison group attempts to account for changes, ot than the treatment, that may affect safety between the before and after periods. The changes crashes at comparison group sites are observed over the same period as at the treatment
site~

provide a better estimate of what would have happened at the treatment sites had the treatm not taken place Hauer (1997). In some cases, the comparison group can be treatment sites,
Sl

as when it is assumed that certain accident types will not be affected by the treatment. K1
(1980) and Zador (1982) used daytime accidents as comparison groups for nighttime accidel

during the evaluation of the effectiveness of raised pavement markers. Griffin (1992) stressed selecting the comparison group to ensure that the group should not be affected by the treatrn being evaluated. Hauer (1988) does not consider close physical similarity between the treatrn and comparison sites to be critical. Instead, Hauer (1988) maintains that it is more importanl have close agreement in the monthly or yearly accident frequencies for both the treatment : comparison groups before implementing improvements for the treatment sites. In other
WOl

Hauer (1997) concluded that it is not vital for the comparison sites to look like the treatm sites, but that it is vital that the comparison sites have accident histories similar to the accid histories for the treatment sites for period before improvement at those sites. Hauer (1997) suggested that a potential problematic factor in site-specific highway sal studies exists when the comparison group concept does not address regression-to-the-mean b The bias occurs because of the non-random process of treatment site selection. The treatment selection process generally involves selecting sites because of the size of their most re(

accident histories (1 to 3 years). Because of this biased selection process, there exists a high probability that a reduction in crashes might be observed even if these sites were left untreated. The development of the empirical Bayesian methodology (EB) is relatively recent, and applications to date have been limited. This technique is based on the selection of a reference group (a group of intersections consisting of homogeneous sites with the same geometric and traffic flow characteristics) to adjust for the regression-to-the-mean bias. The safety properties are different for each intersection, even if they have similar traffic flows and other similar traits. The safety of entities is usually estimated from the history of their accident counts. However, estimating safety this way becomes difficult when there is an inadequate accident history. The EB method overcomes this limitation by combining accident counts with knowledge about the safety of similar entities which depends on physical characteristics such as road geometry, road environment, and traffic volume. By using these two sources of information, EB estimates improve the accuracy of predictions and compensate for regression-to-the-mean bias (Hauer, 1997).
Estimation of Expected Number of Accidents
An estimate of the mean number of accidents E( K
)

of an entity is obtained from accident

prediction models, also called safety performance functions (Hauer, 1997). The accident prediction models relate the annual accident experience of an entity to its characteristics. Accident prediction models have several uses in safety analysis. They can be used to examine how the actual accident experience of a specific intersection compares to the expected safety performance of similar intersections. These models are also used in the EB method to, in effect, smooth the random fluctuations in accident counts when estimating the number of accidents expected over time at a specific intersection. These expected values are used in before-after studies and can also be used in the screening of potentially hazardous sites for treatment.

Since traffic accidents are random events, statistical principles must be used to build the predictive equations (Lord, 2000). Hauer et al. (1988) developed functions to portray a relationship between traffic flow and collisions of vehicles and to relate accidents for urban signalized intersections. Mountain et al. (1996) used negative binomial regression analysis and developed accident prediction models for roads with minor junctions. Sawalha and Sayed (2001) developed accident prediction models for urban arterial roadways in the City of Vancouver. Bonneson et al. (1993) developed an aggregate model for all accidents at rural road intersections. AI-Turk and Moussavi (1996) and Poch and Mannering (1996) built models by impact types (rear-end, right-angle, etc.). In addition to the total number of accidents, Lau, May, and Smith (1989) proposed a procedure to estimate intersection safety by accident classifications (fatal, injury, and PD~). Hauer et al. (1988) used a model to estimate injury accidents asa fraction of the total accidents. To allow microscopic estimation, AI-Turk and Moussavi (1996) and Hauer et al. (1988) developed models for several time periods (a.m. peak, p.m. peak, etc.). AIl of these studies used traffic volume as the sole independent variable and provided additional parameters to enable the models to be used in an empirical Bayesian framework. The approach used by Lau et al. (1989) is perhaps more convincing, since it is easy to link intersection safety to economic loss, but this approach does not relate accident frequency to conflicting traffic flow. Persaud et al. (1998) developed aggregate and disaggregate models to estimate the safety performance of three-legged and four-legged signalized intersections. The disaggregate models predicted accidents for specific conflicting movements, such as collisions between straight and left-turning vehicles as well as right-angle accidents. The aggregate models attempted to relate accidents to causal factors using geometric characteristics as well as traffic volume as independent variables.

The mean number of accidents E( K

)

of a reference population in fact varies because of

factors such as the demographics of drivers, vehicles, road environments, and other factors that could not be included in the accident prediction model. The distribution of this mean within the reference population has been postulated to be adequately represented by the Gamma probability distribution (Hauer, 1988 and 1997). The accident count at a site is described by the Poisson distribution with known mean, and the accident counts within a reference population may be described by negative binomial distribution (Hauer, 1988 and 1997). To obtain a refined estimate of the mean number of accidents of a specific site, the accident history of the site can be considered as well. In this, the empirical Bayesian procedure, estimates the mean number of accidents (K) of any intersection of interest based on its accident history and E( K) of the reference population. The EB method aims to smooth out the random fluctuations in accident data by combining E( K) and K. Further discussion on EB estimation is provided in Chapter 4. The estimates of E( K ) of entity come from an accident prediction model (Hauer, 1997). The change ofE( K ) with time is reflected in a comparison ratio C i, y which is equal to the model estimate for entity i for year y divided by the model estimate for entity i for year 1. Thus, E( K i, y) / E( K The estimation of

According to Hauer (1997), it can be assumed that 11: and Aare independent of each other. Method 2: The Index of Effectiveness (8) A biased estimate of 8 is given by:

8=A/11:

(8)

The percent change in crashes is in fact, 100(1- 8). From Hauer (1997), an approximate unbiased estimate of 8 is given by: 6 = (AI 11:)1 {l+ [Var (11:)1 (xi]) where, 6 = The index of effectiveness and the measure of safety improvement. The variance of 8 has been given as: Var (6) = 6 2 [(Var (A)I A2) + (Var (x)1 x 2)]1 [1 + Var (x)/1t 2]2 (10) (9)

Once the index of effectiveness (theta) for an individual site is calculated, the composite effect on all treated sites can be calculated by summing up all the values of 1t, and variance of 1t, and putting the values in Equation 4 and 5.

2.2 Left-Turn Collisions at Intersections
The increase in traffic volume on urban intersections has led engineers to develop innovative means to control traffic. Traffic signals are considered a way to improve traffic safety and traffic operations at intersections (pemia et al. 2002). With an increase in traffic volume, a driver has fewer available gaps in the opposing through traffic to execute a left-tum maneuver safely. This section contains information about treatments for reduction of left-tum collisions with more emphasis on left-tum signal phasing.

The treatment of left tum maneuvers at signalized intersections can have a signiJ operational and safety impact. While adding left-tum phasing, which provides exclusive tin left turns to maneuver through the intersection, there can also be a major influence on deh all motorists including those turning left. Geometric configuration also plays an important r~ the operation of left turns at signalized intersections (Sebastian, 1999). Upchurch (1986) postulated that left-tum lanes may provide a separate area or refu~ vehicles from through traffic that offset tum lane provides a longer sight distance for leftand that restricted sight distance to opposing traffic creates potential accident situations. 0 al. (2001) concluded that the use of triple left-tum lanes is gaining acceptance as an alterI1 for relieving congestion at intersections with high left-tum volumes. A triple left tum al three lanes of vehicles to tum left simultaneously during a signal phase. It produces a
gt

discharge of turning vehicles over a shorter amount of times, thus making available addit green time for other traffic movements within the intersection. Aside from geometric redesign of intersections, the use of left-tum signal phasir perhaps, the primary method of improving safety of left-turns at signalized intersect Upchurch (1986) concluded that phasing operations alone have the greatest effect on left collision rates. The intent ofleft-turn phasing is to meet three basic criteria: 1) 2) Provide some minimum level of service or maximum delay time for left-turning vehicl Minimize delay on the intersection approach (left, through, and right-tum movell combined) consistent with objective 1, and 3) Minimize left-turn-related accidents to the extent practicable and consistent with obje 1 and 2.

For the practical application of warrants, it is important that the choice of left-turn phasing be a function of easily and quickly measured intersection characteristics or variables. The most promising potential candidate variables are: · · · · · Left-tum volume Adjacent through volume Opposing volume Number of lanes Number of left-tum-related accidents According to the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD, 1998), there are three types of left-tum phasing at signalized intersections: permissive only, protected only, and protected/permissive. The terms permissive only (also called permitted only), protected only and protected/permissive are specifically identified in section B.4.S of the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Types of left-tum phasing are discussed as follows: a)

Permissive Only - When left turns may be made on the circular green indication after
yielding to oncoming traffic and pedestrians (called permitted mode), the signal display for left turns shall be identical to the display to through traffic. A separate indication or signal face for left turns is not required (MUTCD, 1998). Permissive phasing works well when the left tum volume is low. Average left-tum delay is less in this phasing if the number of lanes is 2 or fewer. Average through delay is less (3 to 6 seconds per vehicle) in this type of phasing (Upchurch 1986).

(b) Protected only - Left turns may be made only when the left circular green indication is illuminated (MUTCD, 1998). Protected phasing has the highest left-tum delay and the lowest left-tum crash rate. This phasing is considered the safest (Sebastian, 1999). The

primary reason for implementing protected-only phasing is to accommodate left t safely when gaps are not available in through traffic or when vision is restri, Upchurch( 1986) concluded from research that protected phasing is preferred wher designed speed of opposing traffic is more than 45mph, the number of lanes is gn than three, and the sight distance is insufficient (250 ft for speeds of35 mph or less, 400ft for speeds greater than 35 mph). Protected-only phasing should be impleme as a safety measure because there are fewer numbers of crashes when this typl phasing is implemented (Shebeeb, 1995). (c) Protected/Permissive Phasing - This operation involves providing a left-tum arrm needed, but left turns may also occur during the circular green indication after yielc to oncoming traffic(MUTCD, 1998). Protected! permissive phasing significa reduces left-tum delay (compared to permissive phasing) (Sebastian, 19

Protected/permissive phasing has the largest average number of total left-tum cras according to Shebeeb (2003), who suggests that it should not be implemented: safety measure, but perhaps this is due to volume? The protected/permissive phasing may be further categorized as: · Lead Phase. In this phasing, the green arrow for left-turns starts before the circ green for through traffic. · Lag Phase. In this phasing, the green arrow for left-turns starts after the circular gJ for through traffic (Box et al. 2003). The average number of accidents with protected/permitted lead phasing operation lower compared to protected/permitted lag phasing. However, lag phasing may be considerel a method to increase intersection efficiency when there are no indications of possible accic problems (Box et al. 2003). 13

According to Shebeeb (1995), an increase in the left-tum traffic volume or in the corresponding opposing traffic volume causes a significant increase in the number of left-tum accidents (Shebeeb, 2003). Box et al. (2003) suggested that, at coordinated signalized intersections, leading or lagging designs do not differ in terms of through traffic delays. Instead, their strength and weakness resides mainly in left-turning traffic delay. Lagging designs for the downstream signal generate less delay than leading designs, no matter which design may be used for the upstream signal (Li et al. 2003). Lagging designs at both intersections yield the best results in terms of overall intersection delay (Gan, 2001). Sebastian (1999) conducted a study and concluded that protected/permissive phasing has a significantly higher left-tum crash rate compared to both protected only and permitted only phasing. Brehmer et al. (2003) evaluated changes in accidents after introduction of protected / permissive left-tum control and concluded that provision of flashing yellow left tum arrow is an effective way to reduce left tum collisions. The flashing yellow arrow indication/display was found to result in a high level of understanding for drivers as compared with the circular green indication. The result of this study also indicates that the flashing yellow arrow display offers more versatile field application features in crash reductions as compared with the circular green indication.

Summary
Researchers have suggested that improving traffic operation at signalized intersections

can be accomplished by employing different traffic operation and efficiency treatments. The safety effect of left tum phasing has been discussed in the literature but only in the context of operational efficiency of intersections. None of these studies really focus on safety evaluation based on left-tum crashes and no evaluation of the left tum priority phasing has used the

empirical Bayesian methodology. This methodology is the most advanced one for addressing regression-to-mean bias. Hence, there exists a gap in estimating the safety of left-tum phasing. This study is focused on evaluating the effectiveness of left-tum priority signal phas for intersections in the City of Toronto. This study simultaneously evaluates the impact on safety effect of treatment of operational measures such as level of service.

DATA
datase~

Data used in this study were obtained from the City of Toronto. The

consisted of

three parts. Part one was the files containing pertinent physical information of the intersections in the sample; part two were files containing traffic flow data; and part three consisted of files containing extensive records for each accident reported on the city of Toronto roads during the years 1996 to 2000.

3.1 Physical Data
The physical data were obtained from electronic files. A total the 35 intersections selected for study were treated for left-turn priority signal phasing by the City of Toronto. These intersections were treated during the years 1997, 1998, and 1999 by introducing some form of left-tum signal phasing. All of these intersections were four-legged, and located in the urban environment. The intersection data file contained information about the physical features of the intersections. The following information was collected from this file: · The vital piece of information in the physical files was PX number (Coded number assigned to intersections). The City uses these coded numbers instead of street names on the intersections. These numbers help to provide access to City data about each intersection.

3.2 Traffic Information
The traffic volume for each intersection of interest was of primary importance in research. The original traffic counts database, which consisted of approximately 1,800signali intersections in Toronto, was obtained from the City. This database consisted of two
type~

digital files. The first type of file pertained to traffic counts that were performed at signali intersections by observers for 8-hour periods, while the second type consisted of traffic
COl

that were recorded on city streets by automatic counters (over 24-hour periods). Traffic flow c were available for the years 1984 to 1996 for observed counts, and from 1992 to 2001 automatic counts. For each type of information, a different computer file existed for every y of available data. Traffic counts were taken at intersections during the morning, mid-day,
j

afternoon peaks as well as one off-peak period. For the second type, traffic counts were collee between intersections for a 24-hour period. Peak-hour volumes (a.m./p.m.) were collee directly from electronic files that were available with the City traffic flow database. Two-h counts start at 7:30 a.m., 11 :00 a.m., and 4:00 p.m. for the peak periods. For the off-peak peri traffic counts are performed for 1 hour in the morning and afternoon starting at 10:00 a.m. 2:00 p.m., respectively_ Traffic counts are divided into IS-minute periods and include
j

possible movements at an intersection (12 movements for 4-legged intersections, 6 moveme for 3-legged intersections). Missing traffic flow information was generated by different techniques. This sect provides an explicit methodology used for the generation and preparation of missing data 1

were required for analysis during this research. Capacity analysis was performed to findHCS (Highway Capacity Software) delay, level of service, and capacity of the intersections in this study in an attempt to relate safety effectiveness to these operational measures.

Procedure to Estimate AADT
To estimate accurately the safety at intersections or any other facility, it is important to have accident and traffic flow data for as many years as possible. Indeed, better and more robust accident predictions and evaluation of countermeasure effectiveness can be developed with a large sample size. In some circumstances, such as when creating accident prediction models that incorporate trends, it is necessary to have complete data for the entire study period (Lord, 2000). Unfortunately, since manual traffic counts are very expensive to perform and the financial resources of transportation agencies are quite limited, it is not possible to record traffic at every intersection for every year. To overcome this drawback, it was necessary to find a method to estimate traffic volume for the missing years. The following three methods were applied to estimate missing average annual daily traffic (AADT). · · · The Method of Least Squares Traffic Flow Trend Analysis Weighted Average Ratios

The Method 0/ Least Squares
The method of Least Squares was applied to estimate missing traffic flow for signalized intersections in the jurisdiction of the City of Toronto (Lord, 2000). The estimated missing

AADT obtained by this method were used for treated and untreated intersections. The untrea1 intersections were used as reference group. This procedure is divided in four sequential steps: · · · · Expand 8-hour counts to the annual average daily traffic (AADT) counts Estimate the missing AADTs Compute the flows for each leg and movement (Le., left, right, through) Predict hourly flows for different time periods The database consists of all the signalized intersections that are in the city of Toronto. ' have reliable estimates, a large sample size and detailed information on each intersection in 1 sample are needed.

Expansion From 8-hour Counts to MDT
Several expansion factors were applied to transform 8-hour observed traffic counts AADT. These factors were created by the City of Toronto from their permanent counti stations. The expansions factors are divided into five categories:
1.

Roads that are classified as freeways or expressways Roads located in the downtown core Roads that are classified as suburban arterial roads Industrial and commercial area roads Roads located in residential areas For each category, a different expansion factor exists for the day of the week and t

month of the year. There are a total of 84 expansion factors (7 days *12 months) for ea category. Each leg of an intersection is classified according to one of the five categories. F each leg of an intersection, the appropriate factor was collected from the list of expansion fact( 19

and added to a spreadsheet manually. Table 1 shows the expanSiOn factors used for the intersection of Eglinton Avenue (West) and Avenue Road for the year 1997.

Estimating Entering Flows
The AADTs of each movement were initially added together to
comput~

the total

entering AADT of the intersection. The task is to estimate the total entering AADT values of the missing years. To fill in the blanks, it was assumed that the traffic from year to year is made of two components.

The first component represents a Toronto-wide trend change. The second componer specific to each road and is approximately linear. To estimate the Toronto-wide change, the average entering flow of each intersection' calculated. Then each entering flow was divided by this average to normalize the entering fl, Therefore, the row of numbers should have a mean of 1. The process described above performed for each intersection in the study. The mean of the normalized entering flows then computed for each year to estimate the Toronto-wide change. Before moving towards the next step, which involves estimating the trend that is spec to each intersection, the Toronto-wide trends from the normalized entering flows of e intersection under estimation of flow were removed. For example, the normalized entering f1 and Toronto-wide normalized entering flow in 2000 for Eglinton Ave. (W) and Avenue RI were 1.024 and 0.994 respectively. Here we have to see whether a Toronto-wide trend, absent. One should expect the normalized entering flow to be 1.024/0.994=1.03. This proc was performed for every year. All entering flows were similarly adjusted (see Figure 1). Once the normalized entering flows were adjusted, a linear equation was fitted for e intersection. The equation of the fitted line is of the form:
y= a + J3*X (

deviation is a function of the standard deviation of each intersection and the Toronto-wide tre simultaneously (Hauer (1993).

Estimating Traffic Flow for Each Approach
Once the entering flow of each intersection was estimated, the total entering flow v. reassigned to the respective leg and movement. For each available count described in the fi step, the traffic flow of each movement was divided by the total entering flow for ev( intersection. Then, the average proportion of each movement was computed. When more th one year of data were available, there was the possibility of 12 different proportions for a 23

given intersection (4 legged). Once the proportion of every movement was computed, the flows were reassigned to their respective legs and movement. This was performed by multiplying the total estimated entering flow (computed in Step 2) by the proportions calculated in this step. This reassignment process was conducted for every intersection and year.

Traffic Flow Trend Analysis
The 35 treated intersection had some missing years traffic flow data in the before and after periods, respectively. These missing data were estimated separately for each intersection. For the treated intersections, in either before or after periods, with two or more counts available, trend analysis was done to estimate the traffic counts for the missing years. The number of counts available in the before period was more than the number in the after period. Most of the AADT estimates for the treatment groups were obtained by this method. An example of the analysis for Steeles Ave. (West) and Keele St. is shown in Figure 2 for the before period. Statistics of the regression analysis are given in Table 3.

Average Ratio Method
An average ratio method was applied to fill in the blank fields (missing AADT) for some of the intersections in this study. Intersections with maximum number of AADT counts available were used to calculate the averages of AADT for each year. The ratios of these averages relating one year to another were applied to estimated missing AADT based on a year with known AADT. The same process was repeated for before and after periods separately. The average ratio values for the after period years 1997-2000 are shown in Table 4.

3.3 Accident Data System
Accident data consisted of two electronic files that recorded the accidents from 19 2000. One file contained disaggregated data. This file provided information about each ace that occurred, including day, time, number of vehicles involved, number of persons injur, killed, impact, initial direction of each involved vehicle, and maneuver type (left-tum collis rear-end collisions, and angle collisions, etc), and year-wise total of the accidents that occ on each intersection. However, the details of total injury, fatal injury and PDO accidents provided separately. The second file contained aggregated data for each collision type. ' number of collisions for each collision type is given in this file.

3.3.1 Vehicle Movement Information
Vehicle movement information is of primary importance for accident type and coul used to identify the direction of flow for each or both vehicles involved in a collision. research focuses on collisions of vehicles making left-tum movements. Left-tum collisions, tum side-impact collisions (one vehicle turning-left collides with opposing vehicle going str in opposite direction) and all impact types combined collisions were considered for this t1 Vehicle initial direction was shown in the accident dataset. This detail is shown in Table 5 such information was available in the data provided, but there were some problems in this since some of entries were wrong and/or missing. The second type of information require identify accidents was impact type, especially where left-turning injury/fatal collisions being investigated. Vehicle impact types are given in Table 6. In the data set, the third tYI information of relevance was vehicle maneuvers. This was described by one of the 14 detailed in Table 7. The movement of the vehicle was definable only when the maneuvers specified, for example, 'going ahead', turning-right', or 'turning-left'.

3.3.2 Basic Information
A group of fields representing basic information for each accident was recorded in this segment. The fields that are relevant to this study are listed and described below: · Accident number. Each accident was referenced by a number. The same accident number was also used in the corresponding police report. · Accident date. This field recorded the time, day, month, and year when accidents occurred. A separate file for each year and month was created, as needed for before-after study. · Day of week and time of accident. Information given by both fields can be combined to evaluate the safety of intersections for a.m. and p.m. peak periods. For the purposes of

this study, the a.m. peak period occurs between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m. and the p.m. period occurs between 4:30 and 5:30 p.m. Such periods on Saturday and Sunda excluded from the peak period samples. · Signal timing, Metro Toronto uses MTSS (Metro Toronto signaling software operating approximately 1800 signalized intersections in its jurisdiction. Signal tirr phasing, and relevant information was recorded directly from the database. · Signals information for the before period was collected from hard copies of available in the Metro Toronto library. · Turning movement count summary for before and after dates were collected electronic files maintained by the City's transportation department. · Peak hourly volume for peak IS-minute volume.

3.4 Level of Service and Capacity
Highway capacity software (HCS 2000, Version 4.1 B) was used to estimate capacit: level of service during the a.m. and p.m., peak periods of treated intersections. The following data were required for this process: · Signal timings (cycle length and phasing) for the intersections under study as extr from Metro Toronto Signalization Software (MTSS). · Date of modifications made to present signal timing as noted in the files maintaine each intersection of Metro Toronto. · Flow details extracted from electronic files; 24-hour volume, peak hourly volume

METHODOLODY

This chapter presents an overview of the methodology adopted for evaluating the safety of left-tum priority phasing at Toronto signalized intersections. The chapter comprises 2 sections. Section 1 explicitly focuses on empirical Bayesian estimates (EB) and elaborates on the steps involved in this method. Section 2 maps out the methodology for safety evaluation of the treatment implemented.

4.1 Empirical Bayesian Estimates
The empirical Bayesian methodology is a technique to avoid regression-to-the-mean bias; it is a method of estimating
K

that coherently exploits not only accident counts, but also

information contained in the traits of an entity. This technique is based on the selection of a reference group (a group with the same traits as the treatment group) to adjust for the regressionto-the mean bias. In fact, the safety properties of different intersections are different even they have the same traffic flow and other similar traits. Because each intersection is unique, it is not enough to use accident counts alone to estimate its safety. The empirical Bayesian method overcomes this limitation. It combines information about accident counts with knowledge about the safety of similar entities (entities in the reference population). The first source includes the physical characteristics of the intersections, such as geometric design, road environments, traffic volumes, and so forth. The second source is the accident history of intersections. By using these two sources of information, the empirical Bayesian method improves the accuracy of predictions and compensates for regression-to-the-mean (RTM) bias (Hauer, 1997).

4.1.1 Empirical Bayesian Equations
~ccording

to the empirical Bayesian methodology, if the estimates of the mean

similar sites and variance Var(K), and the accident count Xt" for a given period are known, refined estimates of expected (K) and Var(K) of specific intersection can be calculat( Equations (2) and (3), described in Section 2.1. By examining the series of equations presented, a few points become apparent variance of the estimates, Var (K), decreases as the number of years of data used in the an. increases and as the value of the over dispersion parameter (b) increases.
Fundamentall~
all

makes sense. As more years of data are used, more information is known about each site,

estimate of each f( will be better. As the differences between sites are better explained i model, then the variance of estimates, Var (f(), should decrease. As the value ofb increases. Var( K) estimated from the regression model decreases. Therefore, as b increases, the regre model explains more of the variation in accident experience across sites, and the estimate will also improve.

Regression equations are used to estimate E (K) (the mean number of accident/year Var (K) (the variance of this estimate) for the reference population of interest. Fundamentall: regression estimate of accident occurrence at a site is the average accident frequency reference population with identical characteristics. These estimates are adequate for exam the trends in the data. When a multivariate model is fitted to accident data, it estimates the J as a function of variables (covariate) (Hauer, 1997). However, for evaluation of s improvements, to estimate what would have been expected had no safety improvement implemented, this information is inadequate. The EB approach overcomes this limitatiol 35

using two sources of information, regression estimates and the actual accident history of sites, the estimates of accident occurrence are both site-specific and more accurate.

4.1.3 Accident History
Accident history plays a vital role in obtaining the refined estimates. Accident. counts are obtained according to accident types relevant to the study. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of intersections in terms of left-tum collisions, so information about left-tum injury crashes was needed for this study. When the accident history for an entity is available, its safety property can be refined by combining two clues in safety, the accident history of the site and E( K) from the accident prediction model of the reference population, using the empirical Bayesian methodology to get refined estimates. Available accident history for as many years as possible helps to develop more refined estimates.

4.2 Evaluation of Safety Effectiveness
This section describes the methodology adopted to evaluate the safety improvement resulting from left-tum signal phasing on three types of collisions: all impact type, left-tum and left-tum side impact collisions.

4.2.1 Accident Prediction Models
The accident prediction models were developed by the City of Toronto. The model for all left-tum collisions is: Accidents/year = 1.059u (FI+F2) fli (LT/ (F I+F2)) fl2 where,
FI = Major Street average annual daily traffic (AADT)

Calibration of Models
This section presents a calibration procedure followed in this study. Alpha (a), the model

parameter in the accident prediction models (shown by Equations 12 and 13), captures the influence of all factors that change from year to year. These changes are in weather, economic conditions, and other similar factors but not traffic flow. Alpha (a) changes from year to year. The effect of specific change from year to year (i.e., weather) affects all road sections in the same manner (Hauer, 1997). Accident prediction models applied in this study for safety effectiveness evaluation were calibrated for each year. Accident prediction models (left-tum and all impact types combined) were applied to estimate the expected number of crashes for each year. The observed number of crashes at untreated sites in the reference population each year was divided by the expected number of crashes from the original accident prediction models to obtain calibration ratios. The original model a was multiplied by the calibration ratio of the corresponding year to get an a for that year. Models used in left-tum side impact collisions were calibrated by using the ratio of lefttum side impact collisions to all left-tum collisions. 1R

Step 3
The empirical Bayesian method was applied to refine the estimate of accidents/year. The required Equations are discussed in Section 2.1. Calculate the values of I( i and Var (I(i) applying Equations (2) and (3).

Step 4
Calculate the index of safety effectiveness, which is the ratio of the observed number of crashes in the after period to the expected number of crashes in the after period had no treatment been applied. The index of effectiveness (9) and Var (9) are given by Equations (8) and (10).These Equations are given in Section 2.1. From the index of effectiveness, the accident reduction factor (ARF) is calculated: ARF= (1- 9) Percent reduction in collisions is given as: ARF=100 (1- 9) ARF values, if positive and statistically significant, indicate that safety treatment is effective; otherwise, negative values indicate that safety treatment is not effective. Once the index of effectiveness (theta) for an individual site is calculated, the composite effect on all treated sites was calculated by summing up all the values of).. and 1t, and variance of

ANALYSIS, RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

5.1 Background
As mentioned earlier, the objective of the study was to evaluate the change in the numbers of injury (fatal and severe) collisions following the left-turn priority phasing treatment at signalized intersections in the City of Toronto. The treatment consisted of an additional form of left-turn priority phasing at one or more approaches during certain periods of the day. In several cases, priority phasing of some form was already in place and, a few cases, additional other minor modifications had been done to the intersections. Therefore, the evaluation is of the combined effects of adding varied levels and types of left-turn priority phasing and implementing other related modifications. To properly account for changes in traffic volume and for possible regression-to-themean effects, empirical Bayesian analysis, following the state-of-the-art methodology (Hauer, 1997), was performed as discussed in Chapter 4. Regression models developed by the City of Toronto were used. This methodology estimated the number of collisions that would have happened in the after period had there been no change in priority phasing. These estimated collisions were compared to the observed number of accidents in the after period. Changes in approach AADT and other factors were also considered.

5.2 Analysis
A sample of 35 intersections was included in this analysis; all of these intersections were treated during the years 1997 to 1999. Table 13 provides information about treatment type implemented and number of intersections treated during each year.

The index of effectiveness (9) met] was employed in this study to evaluate the reduction in collisions following implementation left-turn priority signal phasing. The index of effectiveness (9) at an individual entity approximately equal to the ratio of the number of crashes occurring after conversion to expected number of accidents had conversion not taken place. The composite effect over all s: was also evaluated. The % reduction in crashes (accident reduction factor) is given by:
100 (1- 9)

The analysis relates to the following three categories:

The accident reduction factor, following the index of effectiveness, was evaluated for each treated intersection. The overall effect of each treatment type (FAG and LTGA) was also evaluated. The accident prediction models comprise eight different groups. Each group was specific for a different classification of road (discussed in detail in section 4.2.1). This study falls under three of those eight groups, each of which has different values for model parameters and overdispersion values.

5.3 Results 5.3.1 Results for Left-turn Collisions
Table 14 presents the results for the overall estimate of the safety improvement effect for all 35 intersections in the sample, along with estimates for groups categorized by the type of lefttum protection, i.e., flashing green advance (FAG) and left-tum green arrow. Table 15 presents results of safety treatment for individual intersections. Estimates of the safety effect for some individual intersections show unfavourable effects, but these are generally statistically insignificant and are due to chance (as indicated by the asterisk). Changes at individual intersections without the asterisk are statistically significant (at the 5% level). The effect of a treatment may vary from intersection to intersection due to factors such as geometry and traffic volume. These results indicate a 16% slight overall reduction in collisions for all sites combined. The reduction obtained for intersections with flashing advance green treatments was 16% compared to left-tum green arrow phasing which had a 17% reduction in accidents. The results are statistically significant (at the 5% level), but the difference between the two results is not statistically significant. All 35 intersections in this study were protected/permitted; 15 had

Results for Left-turn Side-impact Collisions
Results of separate analysis conducted for left-turn side-impact type of collisions are

presented in Tables 16 and 17. Table 16 presents the composite effect results for each treatment type and all treated sites. These results show a 19% reduction overall in left-turn side impact collisions following implementation of left-turn priority signal phasing on the 35 intersections. The intersections with flashing advance green phasing had a reduction in collisions of 12%, while those treated with left-turn green arrow phasing had a 25% reduction for left-turn sideimpact collisions. These results are statistically significant (at the 5% level). Table 17 presents the safety effect of each of the 35 intersections. Estimates of the safety effect for some individual intersections show unfavourable effects. Conclusions should not be drawn from these results because there is a likelihood that the change in safety for individual intersections, as indicated by the asterisk, is due to chance.

Disaggregate Analysis: Results and Discussion
This section presents a disaggregate analysis, considering the impact of different fac

on safety improvement effects at intersections where left-turn priority treatment . implemented.

5.4.1 Safety effect and collisions per year in the before period
Analysis was performed to examine the safety effect of conversion related to expected number of collisions in the before period (all three collision types). Figures 3, 4, an shows scatter plots of the data for three collision types. A fitted regression line confirms v. seems evident from thes.e plots -- that there is no apparent relationship between the sal improvement effect of left-turn priority phasing and the expected number of collisions in before period. The standard errors indicate that the slopes of the trend lines are statistic: insignificant.

the before period was evaluated using the results shown in Figures 6, 7, and 8. The EquatioJ trend lines and adjusted R2 values are shown on the relevant Figures, along with the stan errors of the slope. The slopes of regression lines drawn are statistically insignificant at th( level for all left-turn and left-turn side impact collisions and statistically significant at tht; level for all impact type combined. The latter. result should not be taken to imply that a 14 traffic volume in itself is associated with a larger reduction in accidents (safety improve] effect) since lower traffic volumes might be correlated with other factors that may also contri to a reduction in collisions.

5.4.3 Safety effect vs. Capacity, and Delay
Traffic volumes, intersection geometrics, signal timing and phasing data for morning afternoon peak periods were collected from the City for the periods before and a implementation of left-turn priority signal phasing. Capacity analysis was performed for e intersection for the two peak periods (morning and afternoon) before and after convers Highway Capacity Software (HCS 2000) was used to calculate capacity, and control delay, latter being the measure of Level of Service (HCM). An analysis was performed to examine impact of these factors on the safety effect of left-turn priority phasing. Table 19 shows results of the capacity analysis for both the morning and afternoon peak periods for both type left-turn signal phasing. The relationship between the effectiveness of safety treatment and average control d( in the peak periods is depicted in Figures 9, 10, and 11. Figures 9, 10, and 11 pertain to mom peak periods for left-tum collisions, left-turn side impact collisions and all impact ty combined, respectively, for each individual intersection. The relationship between sal improvement and average control delay for the afternoon rush period is presented in Figures 13 and 14, respectively, for all three types of collisions. The slopes of fitted regression Ii drawn for Figures 9, 12 and 13 (delay vs. % reduction in collisions) are statistically signific (at the 5% level) and for Figures 10, 11 and 14 are statistically insignificant (at the 5% level). the whole these results (all with negative slopes) can be taken to indicate a relationship betw safety effect and average control delay. As control delay increases, the less likely it is for sa1 to be improved by left-turn phasing.

Figures 15 through 20 depict the relationship between the safety effect and capacity and volume/capacity (v/c) ratio. Morning and afternoon peak periods values were averaged. A fitted regression line to the data in Figures 15, 16 and 17 (safety effect vs. capacity) indicates a trend that suggests that, the higher the capacity, the more the decrease in the collisions will be with implementation of a left-tum priority phasing. However, these trends are statistically insignificant (at the 5% level). For the safety effect vs. vic ratio plots, the slopes of fitted regression lines drawn for Figures 18 and 19 are statistically significant at the 10% level and while the slope for Figure 20 is statistically insignificant at the 5% level.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Conclusions
The fundamental task of this analysis was to evaluate the safety effect ofleft-tum phasing

using the empirical Bayesian methodology. This methodology is considered to be the most advanced evaluation methodology for examining changes in collisions following implementation of a safety treatment. Some valuable insights into the reduction of collisions were gained following the application of left-tum priority treatment at 35 signalized intersections. The safety treatment applied consisted of addition of some form of priority phasing at one or more approaches of an intersection during some peak period (morning or after) of the day. This analysis was confined to injury (fatal and severe injuries) collisions. (PDO and pedestrian injury accidents were not considered) Following are the highlights of the results.

·

Left-tum green arrow phasing is relatively safer compared to flashing advance green phase when analyzed for left-tum side impact collisions. These results and difference between results (25% reduction in accidents for LTGA compared with 12% for FAG) are statistically significant (at the 5% level).

Flashing advance green phase is comparatively safer compared to left-tum green arrow phasing when analyzed for all impact types combined collisions. The results and difference between these results (15% reduction in accidents for FAG compared with 10% reduction in accidents for LTGA) are statistically significant (at the 5% level).

·

There is no apparent relationship between the safety effect of left-tum priority phasing and the expected annual number of collisions in the before period.

There is an apparent trend that suggests that, as the control delay in seconds (ca1culatedby HCM procedure) increases, and safety benefits of left-turn phasing decreases. In other words, the worse the level of service (HCM), the less likely it is for safety benefit to be achieved by introducing left-tum priority phasing.

In summary, it can be concluded that evaluating the safety effects of installing left-turn phasing at Toronto intersections using the latest methodology was a valuable exercise. Even though the safety benefits were small, it is nevertheless reassuring that treatments to improve level of service can be implemented without a sacrifice in safety.

6.2 Recommendations
Given the value and promise of this study, a few recommendations are in order: · The safety effectiveness of left-turn priority phasing should be considered by highway agencies and cities in evaluating potential improvements at intersections. · The City of Toronto should continue the evaluation process by amalgamating the results of this study with data from additional left-turn priority phasing installations. The availability of a larger sample of conversions could mean that trends will emerge that will better define the conditions under which left-turn priority phasing would be more safety beneficial. · In the light of the difficulties experienced in assembling the data for this evaluation study, it is strongly recommended that the City's data and information bases be refined to make it easier to access information required for safety evaluation of all types of traffic engineering measures. Flow and accident data should be updated and error free. Missing fields in the data should be filled with accurate information
