The State of City Building in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton City Region 2015

Letter from the Executive Director
We are pleased to share with you our first annual State of City Building report for the Greater Toronto and Hamilton city region. This is an exciting time for city building. There are many organizations actively engaged in research and advocacy efforts aimed at improving the quality of urban life within the Greater Toronto and Hamilton city region (GTHA). This report inventories and analyses organizations outside of government that are involved in studying and advocating for excellence in city building across the region. The premise of this project, supported by the Province of Ontario and Maytree, is that an increased awareness of existing city building initiatives will expand the capacity of civil society to improve the region. We hope that the information contained in this analysis of approximately 150 organizations will be used as tool to identify opportunities and connect groups with complementary objectives. It can also be used as a resource for governments, corporations, foundations and individuals who seek to engage with specific focus areas. This first report presents some interesting findings. As highlighted in the report, the growth the GTHA has experienced in the last decades has been matched by a marked increase in the establishment of city building organizations to tackle the accompanying urban challenges and complexities. There are also some aspects of city building that are strongly supported, and others that do not receive much support. It is our intention to make this growing database available online at citylinx.info to as broad an audience as possible, in order to further effective and collaborative city building. The data used in this analysis has been gathered over a period of four months, and screened based on criteria that have been articulated in this report. It reflects a snap shot in time and our best efforts to identify and record a first group of city building organizations. This is by no means a complete list. If you wish to add an organization to this database or modify an entry, please do so at citylinx.info. Our intention is to continue to grow this dataset and the geography of coverage in the years ahead to capture more city building organizations in the GTHA (especially in communities outside of Toronto), as well as other city regions in Ontario, Canada and globally. Future annual reports will reflect an increased inventory of information and will include more details on their impact and scope, as well as allow us to track change. We welcome your feedback and invite you to support and partner with us in our activities and efforts.

A. Introduction and Approach
Purpose of the project
Now is an exciting time for city building across the world. There are many organizations actively engaged in research and advocacy efforts that are aimed at improving urban vitality within the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA). While there is a great deal of activity across the region, there has not been a comprehensive inventory of these initiatives. The State of City Building project seeks to fill that gap by identifying and categorizing key organizations outside of government that are involved in studying and advocating for excellence in city building. The premise of this project is that increased awareness of existing city building initiatives will expand the capacity of civil society to improve the region. We will continue to grow the records contained in this inventory year after year. We hope that this dataset will be used as tool to identify opportunities and connect groups with complementary objectives. It can also be used as a resource for governments, corporations, foundations and individuals who seek to engage with specific focus areas. The analysis presented in this first annual report helps identify some of the strengths and opportunities that exist in city building efforts in the region.

Geographic scope
The inventory is focused on the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, a contiguous urban region in southern Ontario comprised of the City of Toronto; regional municipalities of Peel, Durham, Halton, and York; and the City of Hamilton. Together, this urban area spans more than 7,000 km2 and has a population of approximately 6.6 million.1 This bustling region includes three of the 10 largest cities in Canada by population - Toronto, Mississauga, and Hamilton.

What is city building and who is captured in this inventory for the GTHA?
City building entails conscious, intentional intervention to improve cities. We define city building as initiatives that help communities in cities become more sustainable, integrated, inclusive, walkable, and healthy through research, education, and engagement efforts. To be included in this inventory, organizations must meet the following criteria:
>> Be active and engaged in city building initiatives within the Greater Toronto and Hamilton city region (GTHA); >> Undertake activities with a public policy focus (rather than solely focused on service delivery); and >> The focus of work must transcend beyond the scale of a specific project or an individual neighbourhood (e.g. campaigns focused around a local landmark or projects to improve a neighbourhood are not currently included).

Method
Data was collected over four months, from October 2014 to January 2015. Organizations were identified by reaching out to known conveners of city building organizations, searching online lists (e.g. Canada Revenue Agency charity lookup, Canada Helps, Community Foundations) and using key word searches by focus area and geography. Academic institutes were identified and recorded through searching the websites of colleges and universities. Criteria outlined above (active in the GTHA, policy focus, broad scope, etc.) was applied as a filter. The data collected for each organization was compiled to provide an overview of the focus and scale of various initiatives. Each entry includes:
>> Contact information; >> Year established; >> Description of mandate and activities; >> Categorization based on geography of influence (local, regional, provincial, national, or global), focus (social, environmental, and/or economic); >> Subject areas (e.g. transportation, water, human health, etc.); and >> Budget, where available.

This first cut provides an overview of 153 city building organizations across the GTHA. These include registered charities, academic institutes, professional, industry and business organizations, not-for-profit think tanks and advocacy organizations, and one corporation. The inventory does not include government ministries or departments, and for the most part, does not include government agencies, boards, or commissions. This dataset will be added to in the weeks and months ahead, and will be made available as an online, searchable database in the summer of 2015. Conscious actions to make the region a better place to live, work, and play are by no means limited to the organizations listed. Each person, business, and organization in the region shares responsibility for shaping the region. If you know of an organization that meets the above criteria and wish to add it to the inventory or would like to propose an edit to an existing record, please feel free to do so at citylinx.info.

Descriptions of mandates and activities were compiled using information available on organizations' websites. Financial information was gathered from a range of sources, including the Canada Revenue Agency's charity lookup, annual reports, and telephone interviews.

B. Results and Discussion
The Greater Toronto and Hamilton city region is enhanced by a myriad of organizations influencing research and policy in the region. As depicted in Figure 2, charities make up the largest portion (38%) of organizations in the inventory. This data was further disaggregated to reflect the proportion of charities that are charitable organizations (71%), public foundations (20%), and private foundations (9%). Other not-for-profit organizations comprise 28% of city building efforts, followed by academic institutes (22%), professional organizations (11%), and finally corporations (1%).

Types of organizations
Organizations were assigned one of the following five typologies:
>> Charities (including charitable organizations and public and private foundations); >> Academic institutes or organizations; >> Professional, industry or business organizations; >> Other not-for-profit organizations; and >> Corporations.

Age and longevity
This inventory includes organizations established as early as 1855. Figure 3 shows the founding dates of the 153 organizations included in the inventory. As reflected in the graph, new organizations and efforts in city building continue to emerge across the region. The majority of initiatives in this inventory were established after 1980. Of note, most academic organizations featured in this dataset were founded from 2000 onward. This may reflect a trend in academia to create centres for the purpose of collating research and innovation outputs. It is also possible that this distribution reflects the life cycle of academic organizations, which often depend on the leadership of specific faculty.

Specialties
As shown in Figure 4, organizations included in this database cover a wide array of specialties, which speaks to the breadth of issues relevant to city building. Each organization was assigned to up to five out of a possible 27 specialties. By far, the largest share of city building efforts were focused, at least in part, on community building initiatives. Other specialties were education and literacy (including urban literacy), governance and accountability, and infrastructure and land use.

Accessibility Age - youth & gerontology Air quality Arts, culture & heritage Climate change Community building Crime & safety Design Economic development Education & literacy (incl. urban literacy) Energy Food - nutrition & food security Gender & sexual orientation Governance & accountability Human health Immigration & diversity Income, poverty, & affordability Infrastructure & land use Legal advocacy Media & communications Nature & biodiversity Philanthropy & volunteerism Public space Recreation & sport Transportation & transit mobility Waste management Water

Geographic focus and location
City building initiatives across the GTHA were categorized as local, regional, provincial, national, or global based on the geographic focus of their efforts. The largest proportion of organizations centered their city building initiatives at a local level (27%), with the least representation being found at a regional level (14%). Given that many organizations direct their efforts geographically, it is important to consider where they are located. As illustrated in Figure 6, the majority of organizations featured in this report are based in Toronto. This is somewhat intuitive based on Toronto's role as the largest city in the region and Ontario's capital; however, it may also reflect some bias due to researchers' prior knowledge of Toronto organizations. Accordingly, future research efforts will be focused on expanding the number of organizations based outside Toronto.

Budgets
Budget ranges were compared as an indicator of size and financial capacity. Budgets, defined as revenue for the most recent year reported, was collected for approximately 60% (90 of 153) organizations included in the inventory. Budget information was collected for all registered charities and organizations that have made financial information available online via annual reports. Other organizations provided budget information within a range through telephone interviews, while others could not be reached for comment or declined to share information. Figure 7 reflects the percentage of organizations within specified annual revenue ranges. The majority of organizations (68%) reported annual revenues exceeding one million.
