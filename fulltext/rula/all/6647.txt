PAVEMENTS LOCAL CALIBRATION OF MEPDG FOR SUPERPAVE PAVEMENTS IN ONTARIO: ENHANCE RUTTING CALIBRATION AND PRELIMINARY STUDY ON IRI MODEL

by Maryam Amir Master of Applied Science, 2017 Civil Engineering, Ryerson University Toronto, Canada ABSTRACT The AASHTO Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide requires local calibration to account for local conditions, materials, and engineering practices. Previous local calibration studies in Ontario focused mainly on permanent deformation models for pavement rutting. The objectives of this study are twofold. First, to provide an enhanced calibration for the rutting models by using more vigilantly cross-verified input data and updated observed rutting data. Second, to perform a trial calibration for the international roughness index (IRI) model by considering three different calibration methods. Cracking models calibration, being performed by another colleague, has not yet been finalized; therefore, the IRI model calibration cannot be finalized in this study. Based upon 63 Superpave sections, the local calibration coefficients were found to be  = 1.7692,  = 1.0,  = 0.6262,  = 0.0968 and  = 0.2787 , which reduced the standard deviation of residuals to a value of 1 mm. The IRI calibration study found that the initial IRI value plays an important role in the calibration.

Keywords: International Roughness Index (IRI) model; local calibration; Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG); rutting model; Superpave.

CHAPTER 1
1.1. Background

INTRODUCTION

Many studies have been performed to develop an enhanced method for highway pavement structural design. Between 1940 and 1960, under the leadership of Highway Research Board, a number of large-scale road tests were performed; the Maryland Road Test, the WASHO Road Test, and the AASHO Road Test (Yoder and Witczak, 1975). Among these, the AASHO Road Test is the most important. It was the first road test to quantify an empirical connection between pavement performances and influencing factors such as structural design and varying axle loads. The empirical equations were adopted in the first Interim Guide for Design of Rigid and Flexible Pavements, published in 1961. With modifications based upon subsequent studies, these equations continued to be used until the 1993 AASHTO design guide. The major disadvantage of the empirical method is the limited range of parameters in terms of structural design, materials, traffic loading, environmental and climatic conditions, and maintenance practices that the original AASHO Road Test could support. As axle loads increase, new materials are developed, and climate changes, the empirical equations have been found to be inappropriate and their performance predictions unjustified. At the dawn of the twenty-first century, progressive pavement engineers decided to overthrow the empirical design method and develop a new method that had more mechanistic underpinnings. This ambition resulted in the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG), the product of a joint effort by AASHTO and FHWA under the NCHRP project 1-37A. The MEPDG was developed to find the cause and effect of stresses in pavement performance indices. Within MEPDG, we initially assumed a trial design, along with inputs for traffic and climate conditions. Using this information, mechanistic models calculate pavement responses (stress strain, deflection), Pavement responses are converted to distress predictions (Rutting, Cracking and IRI) by empirical models in the software. In project 1-37A, the empirical models were calibrated using the Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) database. Since the database used in the calibration covers pavement design from a large portion of the USA and some provinces in Canada, including Ontario, the calibration is called global calibration. However, from the outset of MEPDG development it has 1

been expected that globally calibrated models may inaccurately predict pavement performance in response to some local conditions. Hence, for those user agencies, software output cannot be a precise representation of current or future pavement performance. The MTO decided to allocate budget from Highway Infrastructure Innovation Funding for further research on this topic. For Ontario's flexible pavements, Ryerson research group concluded that the MEPDG should be locally calibrated for its rutting, cracking and IRI models.

1.2.

Motivation and Significance

The goal of calibration, either global or local calibration, is to produce the most accurate (nonbias) and precise (reliable) prediction of pavement performances (figure 1).

Figure 1. Precision and bias in local calibration The MTO, as a leading transportation agency, is mandated to adopt the AASHTO MEPDG. For future design, preliminary studies within the MTO showed that transfer models needed to be calibrated. Since 2010, a Ryerson research group led by Dr. Yuan has been tasked to conduct the local calibration. The study started with the development of a local calibration database. In this project, Jannat (2012) developed a database that later turned out to predominantly cover the Marshall type of mixes, which are no longer used by the MTO. Nevertheless, using this database, Jannat (2012) confirmed the dire need for local calibration of the rutting models and identified the major challenges that would be faced if the cracking models were to be calibrated. She further confirmed the need for calibration of the IRI model, although the extent of bias and residuals in this model was less than that found in the other distress 2

models. Based upon her study, the research group, upon discussion with the MTO, established local calibration priority in the following order: rutting models first, followed by cracking models (fatigue, thermal), and concluding with IRI. Using the same calibration database, Waseem (2013) performed a sophisticated rutting model calibration, in which he identified the major challenge of rutting model calibration to be the unknown layer contributions among asphalt concrete (AC), granular base and subbase, and subgrade soil. Using the observed rutting series from PMS database, Waseem also experimented with a section-by-section longitudinal calibration method, which was the first attempt at a local calibration study in North America. He also developed a semi-automated calibration procedure, which could drastically improve the efficiency of the calibration exercise. Later on, the study group realized the defect in the local calibration database. Therefore, for subsequent studies, the group developed a new calibration database for Superpave, which has been used in Ontario since 2001. Based upon the new database, Gautam (2015) recalibrated the rutting model and compared the results of Marshall mixes and Superpave materials. In addition, he made a great effort to enhance the local calibration method by identifying the local calibration coefficients that should be set using prior information and the coefficients that could be identified through the regression analysis. Gautam (2015) suggested that the traffic and temperature exponents in the AC rutting model could be set at a specific value based on the most recent rutting study, NCHRP project 930A. In doing so, the indeterminacy issue due to lack of layer contribution was largely reduced, if not completely resolved. However, the data in his study resulted in zero or close-to-zero coefficients in the subgrade or base/subbase models, which was a major drawback of the calibration result. This was the motivation the first part of this study; Amir (2017), to further enhance the local calibration of rutting models. Regarding IRI model calibration, as mentioned before, this was intended to be the last transfer model to be calibrated. Within the research group, Ahmed (2017) conducted a parallel study, focusing on the cracking models. Unfortunately, cracking model calibration was not successfully completed before this study started. As a result, it was decided that IRI calibration in this study would focus on exploration of the best calibration method. Therefore, this work represents a preliminary study using uncalibrated cracking models.

Objectives

The objectives of this study are: firstly, to perform an enhanced calibration for rutting models by revising the input database; and secondly, to perform a trial calibration of the IRI model using three different calibration methods. To accomplish these tasks, coefficient values of the models will be revised in such a way that the most accurate (non-biased) and precise (reliable) predictions of observed values can be obtained. The local calibration database will be developed based on typical Ontario's Superpave and SMA pavement sections under MTO's jurisdiction.

Research Methodology

Based on the literature review performed for this study, it was apparent there was an immediate need to enhance current calibrated rutting models and to perform a preliminary local calibration on the latest global IRI model for Ontario's flexible pavement. The calibration strategy used in this research was cross sectional or, as named by Waseem (2013), a pooled calibration method. By cross-sectional calibration, author means to perform calibration on a pool of rutting measurement values. An enhanced calibration database was built upon the one previously developed and used by Jannat (2012), Waseem (2013) and Gautam (2015). For the purpose of this study, a total of 63 sections were selected and their raw observed IRI and rut depth data were extracted from Ontario's PMS 2015 database. Since the methodology of measuring rut depth and IRI has changed over the past few years, this study only uses the 2015 database for analysis. For this study, the latest version of the MEPDG software (V2.3) was used. Using output from the software, rutting and IRI calculation procedures were simulated within an Excel file. Finally, using least square linear regression technique, local calibration was performed to produce a non-bias and precise performance prediction model. To maintain the integrity and validity of the result, for rutting, the effects of zero bias constraint on the produced standard error was evaluated using two methods. The IRI model is a function of pavement distress over time. Because cracking model calibration had not been completed prior to this study, the predicted IRI results from the default global model were not up to date. Meanwhile, the initial IRI (IRI0 ) value was found to have a governing effect on the final predicted value of IRI. Therefore, three methods based on different IRI0 values were proposed to explore the best approach for performing local calibration of the IRI model.

LITERATURE REVIEW

Rutting and the Rutting Models

Rutting is one of the pavement distresses that may occur in flexible pavement due to repeated traffic load, plastic shear deformation and material densification. To measure rut depth, an automated road analyzer (ARAN) system has been used by the MTO since the late 1990s. The first-generation ARAN contained ultrasonic sensors spaced at 4-inch intervals along the bar in order to cover the full width of a lane and to produce a cross-sectional profile of the pavement surface. Figure 2 represents the second-generation system, or the ARAN-9000 vehicle, which uses a laser rut-measurement system (LRMS). This system provides a higher resolution of 1280 points per profile. The new system has an expected measurement precision of Â±1 mm.

Figure 2. Laser rut measurement system (MTO 2016) The most important part of project 1-37A was a calibration of distress transfer functions in order to adopt the design with the industry (NCHRP 719). The process of using calculated pavement responses data from MPEDG through the transfer function to predict what we actually measured in pavement surface (observed data) is calibration, which is not only model fitting but also confirms the data quality. To provide an unbiased model for pavement distress and a reasonable standard error for pavement performance prediction, a validation of global calibration has been successfully performed for MEPDG under NCHRP project 1-37A. Data gathered for this project was from 136 sections using varied type of soil, climate, traffic and structural data. A total of 94 LTPP sections were used for calibration and validation of new construction pavements. Data from 42

6

LTPP sections were used for calibration and validation of AC-over-AC overlay. Sections with the following materials were excluded:    PMA (polymer-modified asphalt) RAP (recycled asphalt pavement) WMA (warm-mix asphalt)

Under project 9-30A, the original rut-depth model (Kaloush) was enhanced in addition to adding and calibrating following rut-depth transfer function models:    Verstraeten deviator stress-based transfer function WesTrack shear strain, shear stress transfer function Improved versions of MEPDG software (Leahy, etc.)

Model evaluation in NCHRP project 9-30A was based on their accuracy, sensitivity to HMA mixture volumetric properties such as aggregate blend and its sensitivity to temperature and robustness (Von Quintus et al., 2012). For the new version of MEPDG, AASHTO decided to include just the original rut depth transfer functions. The following presents a summary of the latest rutting models for the AC and unbounded materials: 2.1.1.

As mentioned before, the global models overestimate the total rut depth for Ontario roads. In the following, the results of previous local calibration studies for Ontario's roads performed by the Ryerson research group team on rutting models are reviewed. For the first attempt in Ontario to calibrate rutting models for flexible pavements, Jannat (2012) developed a database. Using ME version 2 with this Marshal Mix flexible pavements database, the Jannat, Yuan and Shehata (2014) analysis showed overestimated rutting values for Ontario's flexible pavement sections. To develop a more precise regression equation for local calibration of rutting, they recommended clustering the database based on highway classes. As mentioned before, the main goal of local calibration is to eliminate bias and to reduce the RSS. For RSS minimization, it is commonly expected that by using the appropriate optimization toolbox, unique optima would be generated. A study performed by Waseem and Yuan (2013) showed multiple local optima within the optimization process. Based on their study, unknown layer contribution to rutting was the main cause of the phenomenon of multiple local optima. To address the issue of layer contribution to the rutting model, Waseem (2013) attempted a sophisticated local calibration of the rutting model for Ontario's Marshal Mix flexible pavements. Waseem decided to use a 50% layer contribution for both AC and granular layer individually and to set a zero contribution for the subgrade layer in the case of rehabilitated pavements. For new or reconstructed studies, following the layer contribution measured by AAHTO in 1962, he decided to use 32% for AC, 59% for granular layers and 9% for subgrade layers. In the Waseem and Yuan (2013) study, the authors proposed a new approach of longitudinal (section-by-section) calibration for performing a local calibration study. That resulted in the following range of coefficient values: AC layer coefficient values:  = 0.14 to 0.47,  =0.975 to 1.738 (effect of temperature on permanent deformation) and  =0.229 to 1.105 (effect of traffic on permanent deformation). In addition, Waseem (2013) decided to perform a cross-sectional local calibration study, which resulted in the following local calibration coefficients:  = 0.19,  =1.23,  =0.77,  =0.985 with prefix value of  =zero. His coefficient resulted in an improved R2 value of 0.464 and reduced standard error equal to 1.608 mm comparing to global values. Waseem (2013) analysis was based on the Marshal Mix flexible pavements database. From 2001, the MTO began to use Superpave material rather than Marshal Mix, which demonstrated an immediate need for the inclusion of Superpave sections in calibration studies. 9

Therefore, Gautam (2015) performed a local calibration study on rutting models for both Marshal Mix and Superpave pavement sections to investigate the need of different set of coefficients for the mentioned pavement types. To simplify his analysis, Gautam (2015) decided to use prefixed values for both traffic and the temperature exponent. Based on equation 1, temperature (n) and traffic coefficient (m) refer to the exponent part of temperature and number of load application indices (n=2  , m=3  ). To find the best prefixed values, he performed an analysis on results derived from NCHRP project 9-30A and NCHRP report 719. Within NCHRP project 9-30A, a total of 60 field section were used to perform trench investigation and 46 laboratory samples were used to perform shear and repeated load triaxle tests. Within NCHRP project 9-30A, using rutting results derived from the mentioned tests, longitudinal calibration was performed to determine the temperature and traffic coefficients of the rutting model. Based on result derived from NCHRP project 9-30A, Gautam performed statistical and sensitivity analyses to introduce an appropriate value for a local calibration study for Ontario's flexible pavements. His analysis resulted in a traffic exponent of  = 2  equal to 0.3 and temperature exponent  = 3  equal to 1.5606. In equation 1, the value of global filed calibration parameters ( 2 ,3 ) is equal to 0.4791 and 1.5606. This resulted in prefixed values of 0.6262 and 1 for N and  respectively. This study used the same values for its AC rutting model local calibration. Since the focus of the current study is on Superpave sections, Gautam (2015) calibration result for Marshal Mix sections will not be included. Similar to Waseem (2013), he used both longitudinal and cross-sectional approaches to perform local calibration of rutting models. his cross-sectional calibration resulted in the following coefficient values:  = 2.692,  = 0.000 and  = 0.185 with average layer contribution of 31.21%, 0.00% and 68.79%. Gautam (2015) results, was succeeded to reduce the standard error value to 1.2 mm, yet having a zero contribution of the granular layer to rutting was far beyond reality. For further details of Ryerson work's in previous rutting model calibration, refer to Gautam et al. (2016). Local calibration studies on both rutting and IRI models have been performed by many regional agencies through North America. A comprehensive literature review on rutting models has been performed by Gautam (2015). Section 2.3 of this study is mainly focused on a literature review for IRI models. 10

2.2.

Pavement Smoothness and the IRI Model

IRI, one of the pavement performance indicators, stands for international roughness index. It measures the surface roughness for any pavement type. The MTO uses ARAN to measure IRI and other pavement performance indicators for Ontario's highway. In January 2010, the existing ARAN vehicle was replaced by the latest version of ARAN. The new version contains almost all of the previous subsystems, such as GPS, Laser SDP, etc., as well as some further improvements. The new ARAN vehicle consists of the following instruments:       Three sets of cameras, to collect images every 20 feet as ARAN travels along the highway. High-speed laser distance measurement system, utilizing 36 ultrasonic sensors to measure rutting and roughness along the road. High-speed laser distance measuring system, consist of two infrared lasers and accelerometers along the wheel path to measure roughness along the road. GPS to detect and store the location of each datum. DMI (distance measuring instrument). Three onboard computers.

To calculate IRI, longitudinal profile data for the road are captured continuously using both laser and accelerometer instruments (RoLine Laser inertial profiler). Sample of roughness profile generated by ARAN can be found in figure 3.

Figure 3. MTO ARAN 9000 longitudinal profile data (MTO 2016) In the AASHO Road Test, roughness was presented as present serviceability rating (PSR) which was scaled from zero (very poor) to five (excellent). Value was determined based on traveller interpretation of their ride comfort. Later on, an effort was made by AASHTO to find an actual correlation between ride comfort and pavement distresses, which led to major findings on the correlation between smoothness of the road, its rut-depth variation and the severity of cracks. Based on the study performed by the Transportation Research Board of Washington, DC, a relationship is observed between the smoothness of a road and its design structure, climate and site conditions. The first empirical IRI model was developed by Darter and Al-Omari (1992), representing a significant relationship between IRI and variation of rutting along the road. Within same study, significant correlation was observed between number of transverse cracks, potholes, swells, depressions and the smoothness of the road. In NCHRP project 1-37A, an enhanced IRI model was evolved to introduce the relationship between road smoothness and pavement distresses. To develop an IRI model for flexible pavements, distress data was gathered from an LTPP database for different types of flexible pavements. Based on new and overlaid flexible pavements, data was separated into two separate groups. In addition to the data cleaning process, one major task was to develop an 12

appropriate estimation of initial IRI values for each section. Considering the direct relationship between IRI trend and pavement age, a back calculation method was used to fit a linear model for the trend of IRI versus their pavement age within the service life of each section. Stepwise regression was performed on 493 new and 61 flexible overlaid pavement data points, which led to two separate models for new and overlaid flexible pavement. Another important variable influencing the rate of pavement smoothness

deterioration,was found to be flexible pavement base type, such as granular, asphalt-treated and cement-treated base. Therefore, the IRI model was modified based on pavement base type cluster regression. The following represents the current MEPDG IRI model for flexible pavement with granular base: 2.2.1.

Using this database, she performed a study to validate the IRI global model for Ontario conditions. To produce an optimized predicted model for IRI, Jannat suggested to cluster IRI database based on Ontario's zones. Marshall-type mixes are no longer used by the MTO, so her database could not be used for this part of the study. As mentioned before, during sequence planning for MEPDG local calibration for Ontario, it was decided that calibration of IRI model

14

would be the last step, therefore current study would introduce the first effort to perform a trial calibration for the IRI model.

2.3.

Calibration Factors - Previous Local Calibration Studies

Local calibration studies on both rutting and IRI models have been performed by many regional agencies through North America. A comprehensive literature review on rutting models has been performed by Gautam (2015), so this section mainly focuses on a literature review for IRI models. For Missouri, Donahue (2008) performed a local calibration of the IRI model after calibrating rutting and transverse cracking models using MoDOT and LTPP databases. The bias after calibration seemed to be acceptable, although not all the null hypothesis tests resulted in pvalues more that 5 %. Compared to global validation results, the local calibration effort generated better results with a reduced  value equals to 12.8 inch/mile. For Iowa, Gopalakrishnan et al. (2013) performed a study on local calibration for Iowa flexible pavements. Longitudinal cracking and thermal cracking model calibrations were still evolving and the accuracy of the national calibrated IRI model seemed to be acceptable for Iowa conditions, having bias of 0.67 inch/mile with  value equal to 12.35 inch/mile. Therefore, it was decided to use global IRI model. For Arizona, using the global calibration coefficient for predicting the IRI value resulted in imprecise prediction. Local calibration for the IRI model was performed by Darter et al. (2014) using 180 pavement sections from the LTPP and ADOT pavement management database, which led to reasonable prediction of IRI with reduced standard error equal to 8 inch/mile. For Colorado, Mallela et al. (2013) performed a validation study on the MEPDG IRI global model for Colorado's flexible pavement, which indicated imprecise prediction of IRI. Therefore, an effort was made to perform a local calibration of the model for Colorado's flexible pavement by using 343 sections. This led to significant improvement in elimination of bias with reduced standard error equal to 17.2 inch/mile. For Ohio, using the global calibration coefficient for predicting the IRI value resulted in biased prediction. In order to eliminate bias, Glover and Mallela (2009) performed a local calibration of the IRI model for Ohio's local conditions. After local calibration, a decent correlation between observed and predicted IRI was observed. Although bias was not eliminated

15

entirely, local calibration results seemed to be more acceptable than global ones and resulted in a reduced standard error equal to 15.9 inch/mile Table 1. Calibration factors from previous studies - IRI model

CHAPTER 3
3.1. Introduction

RUTTING MODEL CALIBRATION

As mentioned before, the main focus of this study will be on recalibrating the rutting models for Ontario's Superpave pavements. General frame work would be performing calibration on the pool of rut depth measurement values which was named Cross sectional calibration by Ryerson research group team. Database includes only 2015 database; one-year selection was based on the fact that measurement methodology in ARAN continues to change in the last few years. To perform local calibration split sample method was used. For calibration purpose software procedure was simulated within an Excel file. At the end a non-bias and precise performance prediction model was introduced using least square linear regression technique.

3.2.

Local Calibration Database

3.2.1. Projects and Sections The local calibration database used in this study was built upon previous database that were originally developed and used by Waseem (2013), Gautam (2015) and Ahmed (2017). A total of 148 Superpave sections were originally identified and processed by the previous studies. However, only 63 of the sections were found to be appropriate for the purpose of this study. Effort has been made to produce a clean accurate database. The following are the criteria considered to select those sections:  The selected sections should be a comprehensive representative of the set of materials, geotechnical conditions and structural designs in Ontario. Therefore, the selected sections include projects from both southern and northern Ontario.  MTO (2011) reintroduced Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA) to the list of approved premium surface mix for its relatively high rut resistance characteristic after its surface friction issue was resolved. Therefore, unlike previous studies this study database included SMA sections as well.   The construction type should be either a new construction or an AC-over-AC rehabilitation pavement. Since the MTO's PMS database does not maintain accurate construction and maintenance 17

records, each section was carefully assessed by using their time-series performance data to accurately determine the maintenance and rehabilitation history and thus the year of its latest major rehabilitation. Sections with service life of less than 3 years was eliminated.  For all of the sections, raw observed data for rut depth was extracted from Ontario's PMS 2015 database. The one-year selection was based on the fact that measurement methodology in ARAN continues to change, and the data are not consistent from year to year. As mentioned in chapter 1, a previous study on rutting models was based on a PMS database up to 2012. The PMS 2015 database has been generated from the latest ARAN methodology with highest accuracy so far. Therefore, using the 2015 database will be result in a reduction of measurement variance.  To improve the calibration result it would be better to include sections with performances outside the range of critical values stated in table 2. But unfortunately, the available observed IRI values within this study varied from 0.7 - 1.7 m/km and observed rut depth data ranged from 2.4 to 6.7 mm. This could result in less precise prediction for both models. Table 2. Summary of rut-depth and IRI thresholds (MTO 2016)

3.2.2. Climate Information For each section the average of several nearest weather station was found and selected from the "Weather stations for MEPDG in Ontario", accessed January 16, 2017, https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?msa=0&mid=13iBJ4hBSeGc_gTw_KJsEtwHXPXk. Based on mentioned website a total of 34 weather stations is available within Ontario, database for those station would be updated by AASHTO occasionally (see figure 4).

Figure 4. Location of the 34 Ontario climate stations (MTO 2016) Climate input information used for this study can be found in table B-1 and table C-5. 3.2.3. Pavement Structures and Materials The focus of this study is on flexible pavements with typical structure of AC layers and unbound layers. Section selection was expanded by including SMA sections as well, and their information was revised and modified completely. AC layer for this study includes following Superpave materials:      Stone matrix asphalt (SMA) Superpave 12.5 mm (SP12.5) Superpave 12.5 mm friction course 1 (SP12.5 FC1) Superpave 12.5 mm friction course 2 (SP12.5 FC2) Superpave 19 mm (SP19) 19



Superpave 25 mm (SP25)

Detailed specification for asphalt material can be found in table C-1. Unbound material includes typical Ontario's granular and fine materials, which has been reported in table C-2 and C-3 of this study. Used input information for AC and unbound layers can be found in table B-3. 3.2.4. Traffic Information Section selection was based on an effort to including diverse Ontario traffic conditions in this study. For each section based on their LHRS information, traffic data was obtained from iCorridor website. However, since some AADTT information was found to be not completely precise, AADTT information of each section was compared by their available information within the MTO traffic database. Summary of traffic inputs used for this research can be found in table B-2. 3.2.5. Hierarchical Input Levels Summary of input level used for this research can be found in table 3. Based on available information, input level 3 was used for the purpose of this study. In this level, default regional or national inputs will be used. Table 3. Summary of input level

Local Calibration Methods

In this research, the general principles and steps suggested by the AASHTO, Guide for the Local Calibration of the Mechanical-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (2010) was followed in this study. To develop a non-biased and precise performance prediction model, the following criteria were considered:  Minimizing Residual Sum of Square (RSS)

where RSS - -  = Residual Sum of Square =Calculated total rut depth as specified in equation 5 =Observed total rut depth =Number of rut depth measurements The total amount of the calculated rut depth would be calculated based on the cumulative ruts which occurs in all of the pavement layers.  =  +  +  ( 6)

To develop an optimization model, this study aimed to create a simulating procedure of equation (7) in an Excel file. Since the traffic and temperature exponents  and  in the AC models have been prefixed, the total rut depth model can be rewritten as the following linear regression model:  =  (-) +  (-) +  (-) +  Where: (-) =Calculated rut depth in AC layer based on the global model 21 ( 7)

(-) =Calculated rut depth in granular base layer based on the global model (-)  = Calculated rut depth in subgrade layer based on the global model = Model error term, following normal distribution N(2 , 0) To maintain the integrity and validity of the results, effects of zero bias constraint on the produced standard deviation of residual error was evaluated using following methods:   Method 1: Minimizing the RSS without forcing the bias to zero Method 2: Minimizing the RSS by forcing the bias to zero

For each method, optimization analysis was performed based on calculated predicted rut depth for each layer and their correspondent observed values. Using Microsoft Excel Solver, new optimized coefficient values were obtained considering the least residual sum of square, both with and without the constraint of zero bias, for method 1 and 2 respectively. For this study, for the purpose of recalibration and validation, it was decided to split the database into 70% and 30% respectively. From the total of 63 legitimate sections, 46 sections were chosen randomly for calibration. The remaining 17 sections were used to validate the result of calibration.

3.4.

Results and Discussions

3.4.1. Bias and Error of Global Calibration Based on result of previous research studies it was concluded that rutting model needs to be calibrated for Ontario's conditions. Yet considering following enhancements which differs from previous studies, at the beginning stage of this research, preliminary evaluation on the selected Superpave sections was performed to assess the prediction performance of global rut depth model: This study used the most recent MTO default parameters to execute the latest version of MEPDG software (V.2.3) on the expanded database included SMA sections. MEPDG software was executed at 50% reliability to predict rutting values for the lifetime of each section from its latest major rehabilitation up to 2015. To verify the feasibility of the rut-depth global model, statistical analysis was performed based on MEPDG results and respective observed data. That resulted in an average bias equal to 10.32 mm with a standard error of residual equal to 10.63 mm.

22

Based on the results derived from figure 5 and table 4, measured and predicted rut depth are not from the same population for both models, meaning that the global rut-depth models produce biased prediction for rutting and needs to be recalibrated for Ontario's conditions.

Based on result derived from table 5, it was concluded that using a constraint of zero bias will not result in significant variation for both calibration coefficients and their respective Se values. Therefore, using method 2, cross-sectional calibration methodology was performed on 70% of selected Ontario's Superpave pavement sections.

The final detailed result can be found in tables 6 and 7. Commenting on the accuracy of the layer contribution would be hard since there was no available trench investigation at the time of this study. Figure 8 shows random distribution of residual errors around zero line without any constant decrease or increase trend. From vertical distribution of the scatter, it can be concluded that predicted rut depth falls within two standard error of the estimate of measured values, which indicates a very low bias.

CHAPTER 4
4.1. Introduction

IRI MODEL CALIBRATION

The focus of this part of the study was on performing a preliminary local calibration of the current global IRI model for Ontario's Superpave pavements. One important factor that needs to be discussed is that the cracking model calibration has not yet been finalized. For this reason, the IRI study focused on an exploration and presentation of the best calibration method.

4.2.

Local Calibration Database

The calibration database has been already discussed in section 3.2. The following discussion focuses on the obtained observed IRI data used within this study. Within this part, sections have been checked for reasonableness and consistency of their distress measurement data, particularly for their IRI0 values. For each selected section, observed historical IRI measurement data was obtained from Ontario's ARAN database. From the same database used in chapter 3, a total of 52 sections was selected. It is important to understand that for each proposed calibration methods, data selection criteria varied as following: Method 1 database selection was based on the availability of measured IRI0 values, therefore only 40 sections were found to be appropriate for its analysis. Method 2 data selection was based on the minimum number of available sections for both overlaid and new/reconstruction conditions, which resulted in the selection of 41 sections. Method 3 did not have any constraints therefore all of the 52 sections were included in its analysis.

4.3.

Local Calibration Methods

As mentioned earlier, to perform cross sectional local calibration for IRI model, the general methodology recommended by AASHTO Guide for the Local Calibration of the MechanicalEmpirical Pavement Design Guide (2010) was followed. To have an accurately predicted IRI, following criteria should be considered:  Minimizing Residual Sum of Square (RSS)

MEPDG software consists of the following empirical IRI model:  = 0 + 1 () + 2 ( ) + 3 () + 4 () ( 8) The main challenge observed for calibrating IRI model for Ontario's Superpave pavement was selecting an appropriate IRI0 . The initial IRI refers to the smoothness of pavement within six months after completed construction date. In current database, regardless of new or rehabilitated pavements, IRI observed values varies from 0.72 to 1.97 m/km; therefore, using table 8 default parameters for IRI0 may result in additional variation in the local calibration. Table 8. Ontario's recommended default IRI (m/km) parameters for treatments and facility type
Treatments Hot Mix Overlay 1 lift Hot Mix Overlay 2 lifts Mill + Hot Mix Overlay 1 ,2,3 lift New or Reconstruction to AC Freeway 1 0.9 1 0.8 Arterial 1 0.9 1 Not available

For better understanding the effects of the chosen IRI0 on the final result, see figure 9 for a comparison between the fluctuation of actual IRI0 and the default values for both overlay and new pavement sections. Comparing the measured IRI0 values with their default ones, the standard deviation of the residual was found to be 0.22 m/km and 0.16 m/km for new and overlaid pavement respectively. In addition, using global IRI model, software was executed for 52 sections using chosen IRI0 of each model. Subsequently models standard error of residual was calculated. Results can be found in table 9.

Based on the results derived from figure 9 and table 9, it can be concluded that:   The standard error of residual of calculated IRI (using default model) ranges from 0.27 to 0.42. 0 dominated the variation in the total IRI that is predicted. Considering the governing effect of IRI0 on the predicted IRI values, it was decided to explore the best calibration method based on different initial IRI values to be used in the calibration. It is important to understand that the actual IRI0 value in future design is a policy requirement of the MTO. Each set of coefficient values (1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) needed to be re-evaluated by using them within a simulated procedure of actual design considering using default parameters for IRI0 values. 4.3.1. Method 1: Using Actual IRI0 For the first method, to produce prediction of IRI values, for each section their actual IRI0 values were used. Actual IRI0 refers to IRI values from the PMS database in the year of reconstruction, major rehabilitation or construction for the respective section. Evaluating IRI measured database, for some sections, extensive fluctuation was observed in the trend of their IRI values. That could be a result of either a minor rehabilitation or a non28

accurate measurement. For some sections, even small rehabilitation affected the IRI values to the extent of, their value of IRI in 2015 was smaller compared to the ones in their construction year. To minimize mentioned errors, those sections were eliminated from the final database. In addition, the lack of available information of IRI0 values for most of SMA sections resulted into their exclusion from the final database of this method. Split sample method was used to perform a local calibration of the IRI model, with 27 sections (70 % of database) used for calibration. For calibration purposes, software calculation of IRI was simulated within an Excel file. Therefore, for each section, MEPDG software was executed at 50 percent reliability to predict the area of fatigue cracking, average rut and length of transverse cracking within their lifetime considering the latest major rehabilitation up to 2015. Following information was used to simulate the prediction of IRI values within an Excel file: For each section, actual IRI0 value was found from available PMS file. For all sections, using this study rutting model local calibration coefficients, MEPDG software was executed at 50 percent reliability to predict the amount of rutting. For cracking models, their global calibration coefficient values were used. For each section, from the output of the software, following information was obtained: For rutting, the amount of rut depth within each layer was obtained. For area of fatigue cracking ( ), using the output of the software, the amount of AC top-down fatigue cracking(m/km) were converted into the area by multiplying its software-produced value to 0.3048 m (1 ft). Subsequently for each section, the percentage of its crack within the total lane area was calculated. Finally, for each section, obtained results were added to the values of AC total bottom-up fatigue and thermal reflective cracking (% lane area). For each section, the amount of mean annual precipitation, mean annual freezing index and clay size particles in subgrade were exported from the output of the software to simulate site factor calculation within the Excel file. Using above information, the ultimate predicted IRI values were calculated using an Excel simulation model. Subsequently optimization analysis was performed based on calculated predicted IRI and their correspondent observed values. Using Microsoft Excel Solver, new optimized coefficient values were obtained considering the least residual sum of square and zero bias. To validate new obtained coefficients, using local IRI model software was executed on the 29

remaining sections. F-test (model preciseness) and t-test (bias) was performed on the validation set. 4.3.2. Method 2: Calculating IRI0 from linear regression Another method proposed by this study was to determine the best-fit IRI0 by including it as part of the local calibration coefficients. Determination of IRI0 should be performed for new/reconstructed and overlaid pavements separately. Considering the limited number of available sections, for this part of the study analysis has been performed only on overlaid sections. MEPDG software was run for the 41 Superpave sections, using global coefficient values for distress models except for rutting. Using the same method as described before, software procedure in calculating IRI was simulated. As mentioned previously, a local IRI model needs to be developed considering the least residual sum of square and zero bias. For that, five variables were introduced and solved for 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 0 . Finally, to validate the result, the newly obtained model software was executed on the remaining 12 sections. F-test (model preciseness) and t-test (bias) was performed on the validation set. 4.3.3. Method 3: Using Default IRI0 The final method presented by this research is based on using Ontario's default values for initial IRI. IRI model was calibrated based on the rate of IRI deterioration caused by distress factors included cracking and rutting. For this analysis, MEPDG software was executed on total of 52 Ontario Superpave pavement sections considering their default IRI0 value. From the output of the software, an Excel sheet was created to simulate the calculation of predicted IRI (rate of deterioration). Observed  IRI values were calculated based on the PMS 2015 database considering the following equation:  = _  2015 - 0_ ( 9)

The first step was to find the best local calibration coefficients, considering the least residual sum of square and zero bias. To compare and evaluate the final results, a similar procedure to method 1 was performed.

Results and Discussions

4.4.1. Bias and Error of Global Calibration To validate the IRI Global model capability in predicting IRI values for Ontario's Superpave pavements, preliminary evaluation was performed on 52 selected pavement sections. For each section, MEPDG software was executed at 50% reliability to predict IRI values for each section service time considering their latest major rehabilitation year up to 2015. Subsequently statistical analysis was performed based on MEPDG results and their respective observed values by using the following null hypothesis tests:  Null hypothesis 1: To determine if predicted and observed dataset are from the same population, a t-test was performed on IRI experimental database. As a result, p-value founds to be less than 0.05 which indicates that predicted and observed IRI are not from the same population.  Null hypothesis 2: In addition to bias, global model was studied for its preciseness by performing F-test. As a result, p-value founds to be less than 0.05 which indicates poor preciseness. Based on the results derived from table 10 and figure 10, it was concluded that using global model for prediction of IRI values for Ontario's conditions would be resulted into bias prediction with average bias value of 0.21 m/km. Hence it was decided to perform a local calibration on MEPDG IRI model to reduce bias and to define it with Ontario's conditions.

4.4.2. Calibration Results After verifying the existence of bias, observed and predicted values (obtained from the software) were used to determine the most precise calibration coefficients for IRI model considering Ontario's conditions. 4.4.2.1. Method 1 - Using Actual 

For method 1, 27 sections (70% of database) were chosen randomly from the total of 41 Superpave sections. Calibration analysis was performed considering actual values of IRI0 . This analysis resulted in the following calibration parameters with standard error of 0.13 m/km and average bias equal to 0 (see figure 11).  C1 , C2 , C3 , C4 = Local calibration factor for rut depth, fatigue cracking, transverse cracking and site factor found to be equal to 85.83, 0.00013, 0.00026, 0.00193 respectively.

The previously calibrated model needs to be validated by executing the new model on the remaining 30% of the research database, therefore the newly obtained calibration factors have been substituted in the MEPDG software to be executed on the remaining 14 sections. Validation analysis resulted into standard error of 0.2 m/km and average bias equal to 0.1 m/km (see figure 12). Statistical analysis has been performed to assess the accuracy and to determine bias for validation results. Based on information provided in table 11, standard error of the estimated and bias were found to be reasonable. Final results can be found in tables 12 and 13. Table 11.

Using Excel Solver, new optimized coefficient parameters was obtained by generating least residual sum of square value and setting constraint of bias to be equal to zero. Based on table 17 and figure 17, optimization process led to reduced standard error equal to 0.27 mm. Unfortunately, zero values for C1 , C2 , C3 coefficients were obtained, which could not be considered as an acceptable result. Hence, subsequent steps were not followed for this method.

To present the best calibration method it is important to understand that for future design the value of IRI0 should be based on the latest MTO default parameters. Therefore, coefficients obtained from each method need to be re-evaluated by simulating the actual design procedure when using IRI0 default parameters. In order to simulate future design conditions, software was executed in two separate rounds on the total of 52 sections. The first round used method 1 coefficient values and second round used method 2 coefficient values. It is important to understand that for both rounds, input values for IRI0 were based on the current MTO default parameters. For each simulated design 38

method, based on their predicted IRI results and respective observed ones, standard deviations of residual were calculated. Based on the results shown in table 19, method 1 would be recommended as the best calibration method by this study. Table 19. Simulated future design conditions - value of Se

CHAPTER 5

SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This chapter summarizes and derives conclusions from works performed by this study on the local calibration of the IRI and rutting models. Finally, based on conclusions in this chapter, recommendations for the enhancement of this study for future research will be presented.

5.1.

Summary

The focus of the current study was to perform a local calibration of rutting and IRI models, two distress models of the MEPDG, for Ontario's Superpave sections. The literature review on rutting models illustrated the need to further enhance the result of local calibration for rutting models. In addition, as a result of the ongoing use of SMA materials within the new design, an expanded database was built that included new SMA sections. A cross-sectional calibration was performed based by the least squares method, which resulted in a more precise and reasonable result compared to global and current locally calibrated models. For the IRI model, due to the absence of local coefficient values for cracking models, the main focus was to introduce the best method of achieving local coefficient values.

5.2.

Conclusions
Using global models for both rutting and IRI results in imprecise and mostly

The conclusions drawn from this study are as follows:

overestimated prediction results. Performing a cross-sectional local calibration on the rutting model resulted in the following calibration parameters: AC = 1.7692, GB = 0.0968, SG = 0.2787 with layer contributions of 19%, 9% and 72%, respectively. This resulted in a reduced residual standard deviation equal to 1 mm, a significant improvement compared to previous studies. Therefore, the calibration parameters obtained for rutting models can be used as level three rutting model calibration parameters for both new and rehabilitated Superpave pavements within Ontario's conditions. To perform a local calibration for the IRI model, the following methods are proposed by this study: 40

  

Method 1 - Using actual observed IRI0 values Method 2 - Including IRI0 as one of the coefficient parameters and solving for it Method 3 - Using Ontario's default parameter for IRI0 values

Based on the results of this study, it was concluded that using method 1 coefficient values would lead to a more precise prediction of IRI in future designs and hence was found to be the best approach to be used for future calibrations.

5.3.

Recommendations

More studies need to be conducted to finalize the local calibration of the MEPDG distress and performance models. Below are the major recommendations for future studies.  The observed rut depth and IRI values available for this study did not reach the MTO thresholds. To enhance local calibration studies, it is recommended that the updating of local calibration of the rutting model be continued as new rutting observation data that reaches or exceeds the design thresholds are made available.  The calibrated rutting models in this study have resulted in a contribution to rutting by various pavement layers similar to that in the global calibration, which can be further traced back to the AASHO test results of the 1960s. Trench investigation is recommended for a final validation of the global and local calibration results.  The IRI0 value is an important design policy parameter to be determined by the MTO. Further analysis using existing initial IRI data in PMS and local calibration is recommended to determine the optimal IRI0 value for future design. The optimal IRI0 value is not necessarily the mean value of the IRI0 database; rather, sensitivity analyses need to be conducted to confirm the impact on initial capital and construction administration costs.  After a successful calibration of the cracking models, a full-course local calibration of the IRI model following the methods proposed in this study is recommended.

Note 1: For SP 12.5, the unit weight is 2,460 kg/m3. For SP 12.5FC1, FC2 and SMA 12.5, unit weight varies from different regions: Central and North regions Â­ 2,520 kg/m3; East region Â­ 2,390 kg/m3; West region Â­ 2,530 kg/m3 Note 2: For existing HMA layers, should use measured in-situ air voids. Note 3: For new HMA mixtures, use calculated Poisson's ratio by expanding the row on `Poisson's ratio' and set to `true'. For the row on `Is Poisson's Ratio calculated?' Refer to Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide table 11-3 for other reference temperatures and open-graded HMA Poisson ratios. Note 4: Typical PG shown only; PGAC varies based on locations and traffic loading conditions. Refer to MTO Superpave Guide to select the proper PGAC grade.
