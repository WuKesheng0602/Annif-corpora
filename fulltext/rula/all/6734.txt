Abstract
This thesis is based on a photographic collection at the Art Gallery of Ontario that comprise fifty-one photographs and photogravures by the filmmaker and photographer, Robert J. Flaherty (1884-1951). The objects consist of three groups: twenty-three photographs and nineteen photogravures of northern Arctic scenes and portraits; two presently unattributed photographs of northern scenes that are associated with Flaherty's work of the north; and seven portraits of Canadian artists Frances Loring (1887-1968) and Florence Wyle (1881-1968) taken in Toronto, Ontario. All the photographs were taken between 1910 and 1921; the photogravures were published in 1922, in portfolios titled, Camera Studies of the Far North.

This thesis has five components: a biography of Flaherty, literature review of what is presently known about Flaherty and his photography, a brief description of Flaherty's photographs in public institutions, a full catalogue of the fifty-one objects, which is fully illustrated and includes comparative illustrations of related objects examined at the Library and Archives of Canada in Ottawa, and an analysis of three photographs from each of the Flaherty groupings at AGO, primarily based on the research from the catalogue.

Introduction

Robert J. Flaherty (1884-1951) traveled to Canada's Hudson Bay Arctic region on four trips between 1910 and 1916, and again from 1920 to 1921. I The first four expeditions, which began in 1910, were commissioned by Sir William Mackenzie (18491923) to look for iron ore deposits. The trip in 1921 was financed by the fur trading company Revillon Freres to make a film about the life of the inhabitants. From the first expedition to the north, Flaherty employed photography as a tool not only for documenting geological information, but also for photographing aspects of the environment, such as the arctic landscapes, animals and the Inuit, who also worked as his assistants. 2 In 1922, the film Nanook of the North was released and photographs taken by Flaherty over the course of his trips were reproduced as photogravures, published and sold in portfolios titled Camera Studies of the Far North, to promote the film. 3 The Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) has fifty-one photographic works by Flaherty in its collection. These include forty-four works taken in the north; twenty-three gelatin silver photographs, nineteen photogravures (two of them bear the same image as the gelatin silver prints) and two gelatin silver photographs whose maker is unknown, but that are associated with the Flaherty collection at AGO. Flaherty also took portraits of the Canadian sculptors Frances Loring (1887-1968) and Florence Wyle (1881-1968) in Toronto, which comprise six cyanotypes and one gelatin silver photograph in the collection. Together, they form a relatively small but representative group of vintage

photographs - one that contains gelatin silver photographs that were produced under extreme sub-Arctic climate; photogravures that were produced for turning a profit as a result of the film, Nanook of the North, and the cyanotype portraits of Loring and Wyle, which are very different from the photographs Flaherty took of the Inuit. This thesis is a practical project that provides a complete, fully illustrated catalogue of the Flaherty photographs and photogravures at AGO. The main objectives of the catalogue are to verifY and expand upon existing information in the cataloguing records at AGO and make this collection more accessible to AGO curatorial staff and outside researchers. In addition to the revised cataloguing, I have selected three objects from the Flaherty collection to provide an in-depth study of his photographic style and production method. It is anticipated that further scholarship on Flaherty will continue to extend our knowledge of his work, and that the analysis here provides an example of how it can be done, based on the information in this catalogue. For my research, the principal place visited was the Library and Archives of Canada (LAC) in Ottawa. At LAC, Flaherty's related negatives and photographs to his works at AGO were examined and visually documented. The related objects have been included in the catalogue.4 This thesis includes an essay and a catalogue. The essay includes a summary biography on Flaherty; a literature review of what is presently known about Flaherty and his photography; a brief description of Flaherty's photographs in public institutions, and an analysis of three photographs from AGO collection, primarily based on the catalogue.

4 The bulk of the Flaherty Collection at LAC is on loan from the Robert and Frances Flaherty Study Centre, School of Theology, Claremont University, Claremont, California. However, LAC does own several works by Flaherty, principally the photogravure portfolio, Camera Studies of the Far North. which were also examined and documented during this trip.

The analysis, is divided into four sub-sections: Photographing the north from 1910-1916 and 1921-1922, photographs of northern scenes and portraits of the Inuit, the unknown photographs (related to the north) and portraits of Loring and Wyle. The catalogue is the largest section in the thesis. It is prefaced by an introduction with each field defined. The catalogue proper contains fifty-one records and illustrations. Lastly, there are two appendices, the illustrated set of eighteen photogravures published in the portfolio Camera Studies of the North, and a list of works in the Flaherty collection at the AGO that were originally donated in an album. This is followed by the bibliography.

Methodology and Research Process Methodology
At the outset of the project, the fifty-one cataloguing records in AGO's electronic database, TMS, were examined and I found that some of the information was either missing or incomplete and that all the information needed to be verified. When the works were acquired, their respective donors provided what information they knew. s For the AGO exhibition, "Robert Flaherty: Camera Studies" 15 June - 18 September 1994, research was carried out in 1994 by Maia-Mari Sutnik, now Curator of Photography, and Janet Dewan, an independent researcher. Dewan conducted research at LAC and brought 4 x 6 inch photographs of Flaherty's work with her. On the verso of each photograph, she inscribed the date and location of when and where the original Flaherty photograph might have been taken. The file containing Dewan's research includes photographic documentation of Flaherty's photographs, list of the works, and the 1994 exhibition labels on transparency materiaL 6 Judging by the existing Flaherty records in the AGO database, the research by Dewan resulted in changes in the dating and titling of the photographs from their original descriptive titles and dates created by the cataloguer at AGO. I have retained the information derived from Dewan's research wherever possible, and a note to indicate what was previously written follows any alterations to the title or date.

5 There were five acquisitions for the Flaherty works, donated by the Estates of Frances Loring and Florence Wyle (1983); Sandra Ball and Marcia Reid (1987); Susan Osborn (1992); Gordon M. Robb (1993) and an anonymous donor (2007). Out of these donors, only the provenance of Robb's collection could be traced back to Flaherty himself, who had given his photographs to Robb's grandmother. Titles of all the works were created by AGO, except for the photogravures, some of which had titles imprinted on them. 6 The filename is "FLAHERTY, Robert J./ Research File: Photographs & Photogravures (Gifts to AGO)" is kept by Maia-Mari Sutnik, Curator of Photography, AGO.

The first step in developing the catalogue was to detennine which of the fields had infonnation that was relevant to the new catalogue; second, what details were missing; and third, if any of the infonnation needed to be moved to a different field. Each field and element was carefully considered. The actual objects were also physically examined for inscriptions and qualitative infonnation, such as the appearance of the images. Three sources were consulted to research and establish the overall structure and the individual fields for the catalogue portion: Janet Dewan's The Photographs of

Linnaeus Tripe: A Catalogue Raisonne (2005); Mira Godard Study Centre (MGSC),
Ryerson University, Print Collection Cataloguing Manual (2001) developed by David Harris; and The Museum System (TMS) database (2009 version). These different types of cataloguing methods, all of which were developed in the twenty-first century, provide a systematic model for creating a descriptive record of a photographic object. Due to the scope of this thesis, which focuses on the catalogue of fifty-one objects rather than cataloguing methods, I did not research beyond the methods of Dewan, Harris or TMS. The infonnation in Dewan's catalogue raisonne of the work of Linneaus Tripe that I found most useful for application to this thesis were: the reproduction of the photographs in the catalogue; infonnation about the negative which included the photographic process, size, location and inscriptions on the recto and/or verso, exhibition history of the print, and notes in which additional infonnation about the print are included. Additionally, the appendices of exhibitions and provenance notes elucidated further infonnation about where the photographs were exhibited and the history of their owners and collectors.

Harris' cataloguing manual was developed in 2001, and was specifically designed to catalogue photographic objects in Filemaker Pro database software used by the MGSC. As outlined in the cataloguing portion of the manual, there are twelve required fields where information must be entered and sixteen optional fields that can be included as the information becomes available. Together, the twenty-eight fields represent a full cataloguing record. In comparing these fields with data fields found in TMS - the system presently used by the AGO - there are many similarities between the two. However, as the AGO does not have a cataloguing manual at this time, the cataloguing manual developed by Harris provided detailed procedures on how to enter each field consistently and systematically. Lastly, TMS database is proprietary software that is being gradually implemented at AGO that began in 2009. The goal was to create a set of fields that were either the same or similar to TMS, so that information from the catalogue in this thesis can be easily transferred electronically into AGO's database system. However, the catalogue also functions as a stand-alone reference for outside researchers. In the end, fourteen fields were created for the photographs and sixteen for the photogravures. (These are described in the introduction to the catalogue). '

Research Process
The Flaherty works are stored in the Prints and Drawing vault located in the Marvin Gelber Print and Drawing Study Centre on the main floor of AGO. Each photograph has been matted with a tissue overlay to protect it from dust and debris, and is

6

stored in a Solander box. As a student at AGO from September 2009 - July 2010, I had privileges to access the vault on my own. The photographs and photogravures were remeasured and checked for inscriptions or anything adhered to the verso. Fortunately, for illustrations in the catalogue, most of the Flaherty works had already been photographed by AGO. Jane Rhodes at the Image Resource Centre, AGO, provided me with low-resolution digital copies of the work. The process of finding the Flaherty negatives that matched the photographs at AGO, started in February 2010 when I contacted Dr. Jack Coogan at the Robert and Frances Flaherty Study Center, School of Theology, Claremont University in Claremont, California. Both Birnie Danzker's and Christopher's publications indicated that Flaherty's collection of photographs and negatives were deposited in Claremont. Coogan informed me that majority of the photographic material was on loan to the Library and Archives of Canada in Ottawa. The Study Center in Claremont had only the Visual Indexes of Flaherty'S photographic material and a few copy prints. These indexes, six in total, were sent to me as a URL link in PDF format. In these indexes, each page resembles a contact sheet, displaying thirty-five images per page. 7 Each frame has an item number beginning with "N".8 I was able to use them to find the image that matched the ones at AGO. Meanwhile, in the same month, I contacted Joanne Guillemette, Archivist at LAC, to discuss the Flaherty material and to arrange for a research trip. My goal was to examine every object that was related to the fifty-one objects at AGO. Before my visit, I

From the Visual Index it is not clear whether the images are photographs, photogravures or negatives. 8 Jo-Anne Birnie Danzker explained that the Claremont material is divided into four groups (N (Nanook) 1-383 and N 2001-2822; C 1-148 (Canada); G (Geology) 1-55; and OL (On the Laddie) 1-153. See, "Robert Flaherty! Photographer" Studies in Visual Communication, vol. 6, no. 2 (Summer 1980), 6.

prepared a document with all of the item-numbers for Guillemette to retrieve. As some of the materials were nitrate and glass plate negatives, the document had to be sent three weeks in advance of my visit to allow Guillemette enough time to retrieve them from an off-site storage facility. Each item is detailed with their item-level accession numbers with their title names, extent of the materials, and corresponding number in the Visual Indexes. There were twelve objects that could not be found in the visual indexes, and therefore, could not be searched on LAC's website; I sent Guillemette images of these in advance. I made my research trip to LAC in April 2010. When I arrived at the Preservation Centre (Archives) in Gatineau, Quebec, some of the items that I requested could not be found, despite their having an accession number and listing on the LAC's website. Fortunately, Guillemette had been able to locate four of the twelve images, not included in the Visual Indexes. For all of the works that were available, I measured and photographed them (recto and verso), as well as made notes of inscriptions or marks. I entered all the information in the same spreadsheet I had prepared for Guillemette. At the end of the research trip, five glass plate negatives were found to be related to the AGO Flaherty prints along with several other photographic objects including lantern slides, nitrate negatives, and gelatin silver photographs. I was also able to confirm that there were eighteen photogravures published for the portfolio, Camera Studies ofthe

Far North. Additionally, one of the photographs related to the photogravure, The Hunter: Eskimo may have been printed from a film still from Nanook. 9

In April 2010, I contacted R. Scott James, Archivist at The Arts and Letters Club of Toronto to find information on Flaherty's exhibition and screening ofthe Baffin Island film in 1915 (precursor to Nanook, 1920-21). James confirmed Flaherty's membership at the Club from 1914 to 1917, but could not find any documentation that Flaherty held an exhibition there. His screenings included a lecture presentation and showed lantern slides. 10 For the Loring and Wyle portraits, I contacted Amy Furness, Archivist, Special Collections, E.P Taylor Research Library and Archives at the AGO, to see the Frances Loring and Florence Wyle fonds. The Estate of Frances Loring and Florence Wyle had donated a large number of photographs to Special Collections in 1983. A related photograph of Loring was found in one of the oversized boxes. To further verify the objects' provenance, exhibition history and image reproduction history, lastly the registration files at AGO were reviewed. I I

Biography of Robert J. Flaherty

Robert Joseph Flaherty was born in Iron Mountain, Michigan on February 16, 1884. His parents, Robert Henry Flaherty (1856-1923) and Susan KlOckner (1858-1924) were of Irish Protestant and Gennan Catholic descent, respectively. Flaherty's father was an owner and manager of a mine in Iron Mountain, but the economic recession in the United States in the late 1890s forced the mine to close, thereby forcing the Flahertys' to relocate to Port Arthur (now Thunder Bay), Ontario in 1901. Flaherty followed in his father's footsteps in becoming a surveyor and a geological explorer. His fonnal education included Toronto's Upper Canada College, followed later by a short tenure of seven months at the Michigan College of Mines, where biographer Arthur Calder-Marshall later stated "the college authorities, recognizing that he [Flaherty] had none of the qualities of an academic mineralogist, told him not to waste his time and theirs.,,14 This is typical of the early biographies (including those of Griffith, Calder-Marshall and Barsam) written about Flaherty, where he is portrayed as a "cigar-smoking Huck Finn.,,15 This image of Flaherty perpetuates what was to become a widely held idea of him as a natural born rebel who later in life became a pioneering filmmaker. Helen Van Dongen, Flaherty's film editor for The Land (1942) and co-producer of Louisiana Story (1948) presents another view of Flaherty's character; he was a great storyteller and often lent himself to exaggerations about his life. Van Dongen claims that Flaherty's films were not documentaries despite John Grierson's label on Flaherty as the "father of documentary".

Flaherty's films were based on fictional storylines and the facts were "interpreted and adapted by him and molded into elements of a world created by him, a world entirely his own, in which he firmly believed.,,16 In 1910, Flaherty's father introduced him to Sir William Mackenzie, President of the Canadian Northern Railway, who commissioned Flaherty to look for iron ore deposits on the Nastapoka Islands off the east coast of Hudson Bay in Northern Quebec. 17 This was the first of four expeditions financed by Mackenzie that brought Flaherty to the Arctic: 5 August 1910 - 14 March 1911; 6 June 1911 - 8 August 1912; 15 June 1913 - 3 October 1914, and 11 August 1915 - 21 September 1916. His final trip was to Port Harrison (Inukjuak), Quebec from 1920-1921, where he filmed Nanook o/the North. IS This last trip was financed by the fur trading company Revillon Freres on the terms that Flaherty would produce two films; one to focus on "the natural Eskimo way of living in the wilds" and the second to feature the Revillon Freres trading post in Port Harrison. 19 During the time he spent in the north, before he filmed Nanook, Flaherty honed his skills as a geological prospector and proved to Mackenzie that he was capable of traveling in the extreme climates of the Arctic, eventhough he did receive a great deal of assistance from the Inuit, whose navigation and survival skills were indispensable to his surveying. 20 One of Flaherty's key accomplishments occurred during his third expedition, where he "re-discovered" the Belcher Islands. Flaherty subsequently wrote two articles

for the Geographical Review in 1918; one of them was on the discovery of the Belcher Islands and included his photographs of the landscape and portraits of the Inuit taken during the three initial expeditions from 1910 - 1914.21 Flaherty had a strong interest in photography. According to his sister Frances, Flaherty was an avid photographer from an early age, and she said that he preferred the "older style plate camera with tripod" to the Kodak "snapshot" cameras?2 It is unsurprising that Flaherty elected to bring 4 x 5 inch plate cameras on all of his expeditions to the north. In his diaries, starting from the first expedition in 1910, Flaherty documented when and what he photographed. For the third expedition (1913-1914), Flaherty brought along a Bell & Howell motion-picture camera, as suggested by Mackenzie. 23 Prior to this trip, Flaherty took a three-week course in Rochester, New York, to learn how to use it and, shortly after, bought a portable developing and printing machine for use in the Arctic?4 Flaherty was elected to the Royal Geographical Society on May 5, 1913 for his explorations to the "highest northern latitude" in Ungava Peninsula, the first white man to accomplish this feat. The recognition allowed him to include the initials F.R.G.S. (Fellow ofthe Royal Geographical Society) to his name in subsequent publications. However, in 1940, he was dismissed by the Society for not paying his dues. 25 The same problem had occurred earlier with the Arts and Letters Club of Toronto, where Flaherty became a member in

February 1913, but was subsequently removed in 1917 for not paying his fees. 26 His membership record indicates that he was in Toronto just before his third expedition in 1913, which he left for in June. Shortly after his return in October 1914, he brought his then-fiancee Frances Hubbard (1885-1972) to the Club, where she met Frances Loring.27 On November 12, 1914, Robert Flaherty married Hubbard after a ten-year engagement. They had met in Painesdale, Michigan where Flaherty was employed by Hubbard's father, Dr. Lucius L. Hubbard (1849-1933) at the Copper Range Mining Company to perform odd jobs?8 Dr. Hubbard took his daughter on surveying trips and as it turned out, she and Flaherty had a common desire for traveling "in the wild and of seeing country which hadn't been [seen] before ... ,,29 which cemented their bond early on. During their marriage and the rearing of their three children, Hubbard contributed greatly to Flaherty's career as a filmmaker, eventhough her work as a writer and photographer was largely overshadowed by her husband's accomplishments. 3o After the release of Nanook in 1922, Flaherty went on to direct (and in some cases, co-direct) The Potterymaker (1925), Moana: A Romance of the Golden Age

(1926), Twenty-Four Dollar Island (1927), Tabu: The Story of the South Seas (1931), Industrial Britain (1933), Man ofAran (1934), Elephant Boy (1937), The Land (1942), Louisiana Story (1948), Guernica (1949), and The Titan: The Story of Michelangelo
(1949).31 Shortly before his death, he received an honourary degree of Doctor of Fine

Arts from the University of Michigan in 1950 for his work as a filmmaker. Flaherty passed away on July 23, 1951 at his home in Dummerston, Vermont. Despite the lack of recognition of Flaherty's Arctic photographs during his lifetime, the Inuit portraits, which have survived, are considered historical documents as well as artworks in their own right. The photogravures, which were produced for Nanook, are found in many institutional collections. Today, Flaherty is a celebrated filmmaker in the documentary genre,32 but is increasingly being recognized as an accomplished photographer for his images ofthe Inuit and landscapes of Northem Arctic in Canada.)3

32 The term "documentary" was first used in reference to Flaherty's second film Moana by the Scottish filmmaker, John Grierson. See Christopher, Robert and Frances Flaherty, 384. 33 Flaherty's Inuit photographs were one of the subjects discussed in Andre Gunthert and Michel Poivert's L 'Art de La Photographie des Origines a nos Jours (Paris: Editions Citadelles-Mazenod, 2007), 371-373.

Literature Review
This literature review is divided into two sections: the first discusses the literature around two bodies of Flaherty's work, namely his photographs and photogravures related to northern scenes and portraits and the second discusses his photographs of Frances Loring and Florence Wyle. The literature on Flaherty is extensive; it includes biographies, critical essays, and film reviews that pertain to his life and largely his filmmaking career.
34

For the purpose of this survey, only the body of literature written

about Flaherty and Nanook of the North, as well as his relationship with Loring and Wyle is examined. Early biographies on Flaherty describe his upbringing as a boisterous young man who found his calling as a filmmaker during the Northern expeditions from 1910-1916, culminating in the film Nanook of the North, which marked the beginning of his filming career. This story is chronicled in Richard Griffith's The World of Robert Flaherty (1953); Arthur Calder-Marshall's The Innocent Eye: The Life of Robert J Flaherty (1963) and Richard Barsam's The Vision ofRobert Flaherty: The Artist as Myth and
Filmmaker (1988). Photographs taken by Flaherty during his trips to the north are briefly

discussed in The Innocent Eye, which was based on the research and unpublished manuscript by Paul Rotha and Basil Wright completed in 1959. In a letter that Mrs. Evelyn Lyon Fellowes wrote to Rotha, she recalled chaperoning her friend Miss Olive Caven and Flaherty on a date in Toronto in 1914; both she and Miss Caven received photographs from Flaherty.

Also, Rotha and Wright's essay, '~Nanook in the North" is reprinted in Studies in Visual Communication, voL6, no.2 (Summer 1980), 33-60 1S exce~ted from Rotha's and Wright's Robert Flaherty: A Biography (Philadelphia: University ofPennsylvama Press, 1983).

"I chaperoned them once at the old Queen's Hotel (now demolished). On this occasion he gave me a wonderful photo of a husky dog, taken I understand in an igloo, he gave Miss Caven many beautiful presents including a white fox fur, and numerous photos of Eskimoes which she accepted as she admired him very much.,,36 This quotation points to the fact that a number of Flaherty's Inuit portraits were made either before or during his third expedition (1913-1914), and that, on his return, he gave the Inuit portraits to his acquaintances in Toronto. Calder-Marshall's biography also mentions that Flaherty's Graflex still camera was repaired by one of his Inuit assistants, "Harry Lauder".37 Additionally, Revillon Freres, whose name appears on Flaherty's photogravure prints as the copyright holder, is mentioned as the French fur-trading company that financed the production of Nanook. 38 However, none of the biographies acknowledged Flaherty as a photographer nor discuss the photographs and the photogravures used to promote Nanook until Robert J. Christopher's 2005 Robert and

Frances Flaherty: A Documentary Life, 1883-1922, which will be discussed later in this
survey. The subject of Flaherty's film, Nanook, has generated much discussion within the literature of ethnographic studies and film criticism. However, this thesis will not be addressing any ethnographic aspects of the subjects that appear in the photographs, photogravures nor the film Nanook, although these aspects and the relationship between

the photogravures and the film would be essential to a complete study of Flaherty's photography.
39

The articles and essays that Flaherty published in 1918 and 1922-1924 contain illustrations of his trips to the north, but neither the photographs nor his photographic production were discussed by Flaherty in any of his writings. 40 Flaherty's only mention of photographing is in My Eskimo Friends (1924) in which he briefly describes taking close-up photographs of rock samples. 41 lo-Anne Birnie Danzker's seminal 1979 exhibition catalogue, Robert FlahertyPhotographer/Filmmaker (The Inuit 1910-1922), is still an invaluable source on Flaherty as a photographer. It was the first comprehensive study based on original research on Flaherty'S photographs of the Inuit.
42

The catalogue contains entries from the Flahertys'

diaries, a chronology outlining his northern expeditions, and most importantly a catalogue of his Inuit portraits- of which approximately a hundred were exhibited at the Vancouver Art Gallery (1 December 1979 to January 13 1980) and the International Centre of Photography in New York (4 April to May 18 1980) and twenty-nine were

The photograph, Still Photo from the Film NANOOK OF THE NORTH Showing the Hunter ... (figure 40 in catalogue 37) indicates that the image was taken from the film. Further aspects of the relationship between the film and still photographs would be a subject for further exploration. Two sources were consulted, the issue of Studies in Visual Communication, vol. 6, no. 2 (Summer 1980), which is largely devoted to Flarherty and the north, and Jay Ruby's "The Aggie Must Come First: Robert Flaherty's Place in Ethnographic Film History" Picturing Culture: Explorations ofFilm and Anthropology (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000), but these did not provide any relevant information on the discussion of the film's narrative and the photogravure images. 40 Robert J. Flaherty, "The Belchers Islands of Husdson Bay", The Geographical Review, vol. V, no. 6, June, 1918; "Two Traverses Across Ungava Peninsula, Labrador", The Geographical Review, vol.

Birnie Danzker does not discuss the photographic processes

of the prints nor their pictorialist qualities. Instead, the portraits of the Inuit are described as "studio-types" and "confrontation" portraits. She also mentions exhibitions of Flaherty's photographs at The Arts and Letters Club in Toronto (January 3, 1915) and Convocation Hall, University of Toronto (March 30, 1915).44 In the catalogue itself, most of the entries contain a "note" field, which provides information on the identity of the subject, a possible date, and institutions that have the photograph. Moreover, the exhibition catalogue published an important diary excerpt of Frances Flaherty from April 1915, when she and Flaherty met Edward Curtis in New York. During this meeting Curtis showed them his photogravure portfolio of the North American Indian (an ongoing project of Curtis at the time); his portfolios were sold in sets, which may have planted the idea for the Flahertys to do the same with their photographs of the Inuit.
45

Later that

month, the Flahertys also visited Alfred Stieglitz at 291, his gallery in New York, where Flaherty showed his portraits of the Inuit to Steiglitz, and the Flahertys left with his words of encouragement and autographed copies of Camera Work. 46 Robert J. Christopher's essay, "Through Canada's Northland: The Arctic Photography of Robert J. Flaherty" (1998) discusses Flaherty's album of a hundred and two photographs he made and deposited in the British Library in May 1911, and that had been rediscovered in 1998. Christopher explores Flaherty'S interest and practice in photography before and during his first expedition to the North. Additionally, he
43 The twenty-nine Inuit portraits reproduced in the catalogue do not include the other images taken by Flaherty of northern inhabitants. 44 Jo-Anne Birnie Danzker, Robert Flaherty, 26. Also, Frances' diary entry for January 7,1915 wrote about the costs printing and framing of photographs, which might indicate that the photographs were framed for the two exhibitions (Christopher, Robert and Frances Flaherty, 231.)

analyzes the gaze and facial expressions of Flaherty's early photographs of the Inuit that were taken in Great Whale River in 1910-1911. This essay provides an examination of Flaherty's early photographic production and aesthetic in the 1911 album, as the album itself is important in dating and understanding Flaherty's early work. 47 Christopher's full-length biography Robert and Frances Flaherty: A
Documentary Life, 1883-1922 (2005) centres on the years before and during the making

of Nanook, and draws extensively on the Flahertys' diaries (Robert and Frances kept separate diaries), which are deposited at the Butler Library, Columbia University.48 In the book's introduction, Christopher states that Flaherty was both a photographer and a filmmaker and provides considerable documentation of his photographic activity. For example, Robert Flaherty's diary entry for March 6, 1912 reads: Still thick, snowing with northwest wind. Outfit as follows: Flour, beans, bacon, Pork dried fruit, desiccated potatoes, tea, sugar for the three men for five weeks. Presents of tobacco, matches, mouth organs, knives, needles, fishhooks, and Candy to the Eskimo. Two Cameras, 5 x 4 Eastman plate, and 4 x 5 Graflex with 200 exposures.49

It should be noted that this particular entry was not included in the previous biographies
and this emphasizes the fact that flaherty'S photography becomes a feature only in Christopher's biography. Christopher also provides entries that describe, for example in 1913, how Flaherty took portraits of the Inuit by setting up a small studio tent near the house for taking portraits ofthe Inuit. 5o Christopher briefly discusses Flaherty's "studio-

48 Regrettably, I was unable to consult the Flaherty diaries in person. Perhaps

it would be a fu:ure research

project, to systematically go through the diaries and determine how many times Flaherty mentloned photographing against the number of photographs he produced during that period, 1910-1921.

type" photographs which "reveal Flaherty reaching for a more pictorial style, a style that uses side lighting and softer focus to portray a more evocative personality in his sitters.,,51 A photograph of Frances Loring and Florence Wyle is briefly mentioned in Elspeth Cameron's And Beauty Answers (2007),52 and Flaherty's portrait of the women in the AGO collection is reproduced on the cover of the publication. Loring and Wyle's friendships with Flaherty are also discussed in the two biographies of the sculptresses. 53 Interestingly, Cameron claims that one of Loring's sculptures, Eskimo Mother and Child (1938) was influenced by Flaherty's Inuit portraits. 54 Lastly, in Christopher's biography on Flaherty, a diary entry in 1915 written by Frances Flaherty indicates that a photograph was taken of Loring and Wyle. 55

There are an enormous number of archival and published sources on Flaherty that focus primarily on his career as a filmmaker. This survey shows that there has been some discussion of Flaherty as a photographer in Birnie Danzker's and Christopher's publications respectively, but that none of the sources provide an analysis of his photographs and photogravures in the context of his photographing activities.

Holdings of Flaherty's Photographs in Public Institutions
Photographs taken by Flaherty are found in a number of public institutions. The Library & Archives of Canada (LAC), has the most extensive collection of Flaherty's photographic objects in Canada, approximately fifteen hundred glass plate negatives and related prints.
56

While the majority of these materials have been on loan from the Robert

and Frances Flaherty Study Center, School of Theology, Claremont University in Claremont California to LAC since 1979 and 1985, LAC also has two sets of Camera

Studies of/he Far North portfolio in its own collections. The materials on loan to LAC
from Claremont were originally donated to the Study Center by Frances Flaherty, Flaherty's widow, in 1972. In addition to AGO and LAC, other Canadian institutions with a significant collection of Flaherty's photographs and photogravures include the Notman Photographic Archives, McCord Museum, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec; Thunder Bay Historical Museum, Thunder Bay, Ontario, and The Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, Ontario. 57 Internationally, The British Museum in London, England has an album of a hundred and two photographs taken by Flaherty in Great Whale River in 1910-1911. Flaherty deposited the album in the Museum in May 1911. In addition, the Revillon

Freres Archives, Paris, France has thirty albums of2,592 photographs taken during

Revillon Freres and Flaherty for the fourth expedition (1920-1921), Revillon Freres

owned the copyright to all of Flaherty's images, including the ones he had taken in his first three expeditions (1910-1916).60 The identification of further institutions holding Flaherty's photographic works lies beyond the scope of this thesis. 61

59 An inventory of all the Flaherty albums has been created in a document by Michele Therrien "Archives Revillon Photos, Inventaire Analytique" (Photocopy, Archives Publiques du Canada, Paris, February 1984).

60 Robert Christopher, Robert and Frances Flaherty, 326. In the articles and essays about the north by

Flaherty written after 1920, the images are copyrighted by Revillon Freres (see page 11, footnote 30). The photogravures are also imprinted with Revillon Freres' name and the copyright symbol at the bottom of each image. 61 Ten U.S. institutions that have Flaherty photographs are listed in Andrew H. Eskind's International Photography: George Eastman House Index to Photographers, Collections, and Exhibitions, vol. 2 (New York: G.K. Hall; London: Prentice Hall International, 1998). However, the institutions listed may not be the most current as this is the latest index published.

Introduction to the Catalogue of the Robert Flaherty Collection

This is the full catalogue for all of the photographs and photogravures by Robert J. Flaherty in the AGO collection. This comprises fourteen fields for the photographs and sixteen fields (the same fourteen, plus two further ones) for the photogravures. The fields are defined here in the order in which they appear in the following catalogue.

1. AGO Accession Number
This field records the unique item number that is assigned to every object in AGO's permanent collection. The first two digits indicate the accession year, separated by a slash and consecutive numbers of works that were accessioned that year. For example, 87/323, means that the work was acquired in 1987, and was the 323 work accessioned that year.

2. Photographer
This field records the name of the creator of the object, Robert J. Flaherty, followed by his dates of birth and death in brackets.

3. Title Name(s)
This field records the title of the photograph or photogravure, followed by its title type(s), as defined below, in brackets. In many cases, the object has more than one title.

3a. Title types a. Photographer's
Title created by the photographer.

b. Descriptive

25

Title created by a cataloguer when no title is found. Many of the Flaherty materials at LAC, including that on loan from the Robert and Frances Flaherty Study Center, Claremont, California is designated as 'no title data captured' in the institutional records. I have provided descriptive titles for these within square brackets. Any titles in roman are descriptive titles given by their respective institutions.

c. Imprinted
Title is machine (letterpress) printed on the photograph or photogravure.

d. Inscribed
Title is hand-written or typed on the recto or verso of photograph, photogravure, or on the matt.

e. Published
Title as it has been published in secondary literature. These titles are italicized.

f. Portfolio Title as it has been published for Camera Studies o/the Far North.

g.

AGO Primary Title

Title used for AGO exhibition labels and in AGO publications; however this title type will be phased out by AGO.

h. AGO Assigned Title
Title that is an alternative to the AGO Primary title however this title type will be phased out by A GO.

26

3b. Title Note
Records that have title changes are followed by Title Note to indicate the previous title and the source of the new title.

4. Date(s) of Object
This field provides the date of when the object was created, followed by the date type(s), as defined below, in brackets. None of the photographs have a print date, because determining this required more research than the scope of this project allowed. The "c." in front of the date stands for circa and indicates a date range of five years on either side of the date provided.

4a. Date Types a. Negative date
When the negative was taken.

b. Printed date
When the photograph was printed from the negative or when the photogravure was printed.

c. Published date
When the photograph was published in primary literature or when the photogravure was published for sale.

4b. Date Notes
Records that have date changes are followed by Date Note to indicate what was previously recorded as the date and the source for the new date.

5. Medium
ThIs field provides the name of the photographic or photomeehanical process of the print.

27

6. Dimensions
This field provides infonnation about the physical dimensions of the object, with the height proceeding the width of the object in centimetres, followed by inches. This is followed by the dimension type(s), as defined below, in brackets.

6a. Dimension types a. Image
Dimensions of only the photographic image (without borders).

b. Sheet
Dimensions of the entire support on which photographic image is printed.

c. Mount
Dimensions of the support(s) in which the photograph or photogravure has been adhered to.

6b. Dimension notes
This field elucidates infonnation of the field above, if necessary.

7. Inscription
This field records all words or numbers written, typed or imprinted on the recto and verso of the print.

7b. Inscription notes
This field elucidates information of the field, if necessary.

8. Notes
This is a free text field that provides information on the object that cannot be stated in any other field.

9. Alternate numbers
This field records any additional numbers that have been assigned or associated with the object.

All of the records have an AGO ID number that was assigned when the object first entered the institution, regardless if it was accessioned or not. It was a way of tracking the object before it is legally accessioned. Some records have an alternate number for a copy negative, although it is unclear when the number was assigned and to what it refers. The negative numbers do not match the numbers in the Visual Indexes supplied by the Robert and Frances Flaherty Study Center.

29

10. Provenance
This field provides the history of ownership of the photograph or photogravure before it entered the AGO collection.

Little is known about the provenance of the works. The donors are the estates of Frances Loring and Florence Wyle (1983); Sandra Ball and Marcia Reid (1987); Susan Osborn (1992); Gordon M. Robb (1993) and an anonymous donor (2007). None of the donors were allowed to be contacted. The only piece of relevant infonnation discovered was that Robb's collection of photographs by Flaherty (including the unattributed ones) were inherited from his Grandmother to whom Flaherty had given the photographs, perhaps in lieu of payment for room and board.
62

11. Exhibition History
This field provides infonnation on the photograph or photogravure's exhibition history at the AGO and as loans to other institutions (if applicable) after it entered the AGO's collection.

12. References
This field provides bibliographic infonnation in secondary literature, where the object has been written about and/or reproduced.

Index Catalogue

The catalogue has been organized into four sections: 1) twenty-three photographs of northern Arctic scenes and portraits; 2) nineteen photogravures of northern Arctic scenes and portraits; 3) two presently unattributed photographs of northern scenes that are associated with Flaherty's work of the north; and 4) seven portraits of Loring and Wyle taken in Toronto, Ontario. Within each group, the records are organized by their accession number from the earliest to the latest accession (indicated by the first two or four digits), except for duplicate copies ofthe same photogravure or related works in the Loring and Wyle section. These are grouped together in their respective sections for ease of comparison.

Analysis of selected works by Robert J. Flaherty from the AGO
This section provides an analysis of three works by Flaherty in the AGO collection: a photogravure from the portfolio, Camera Studies of the North, and two gelatin silver photographs. Each of these works was selected from one of the three groupings in the Flaherty collection: Photographs of northern scenes and portraits of the Inuit; photographs of northern scenes whose maker is unknown but that are associated with the work of Flaherty at AGO; and portraits of Frances Loring and Florence Wyle. The analysis is based on the research that is found in the catalogue. As the focus of this thesis is the catalogue and because of time constraints, it was only possible to study three works in detail in order to demonstrate the value of the catalogue and the information it possesses.

Photographing in the North from 1910-1916 and 1921-1922
The source of information about Flaherty's photographing activity during his expeditions to the North is derived principally from his diaries. Numerous entries indicate that he photographed the landscape and made portraits as early as 1910, during his first expedition to the Nastapoka Islands;64 On September 7, 1910 (a month into the first trip) he wrote, "[t]ook photos and developed very good photos of the place and people." Many entries regarding picture taking are briefly recorded, often written in one sentence or less. Another entry from September 27, 1910 reads, "Took three pictures." In most entries, Flaherty does not

mention either the specific names of the people or the subjects he photographed; although in some instances he did identify the person and his or her ethnic group. For example, in his entry for December 20, 1910, he wrote" ... at Indian camp, took picture there of Indian boy ... ,,65 References to picture taking and developing in his diaries become fewer in the third (l913-1914) and fourth (1915-1916) expeditions. This is probably due to the fact his filming activities began during his third expedition. However, the references in his diaries certainly do not account for all of the surviving negatives. F or cameras, he brought two types of cameras, a "5 x 4 Eastman plate and a 4 x 5 Graflex with two hundred exposures,,66 on his second expedition (6 June 11 - 8 August 1912).67 On the third expedition he brought a "Graflex Camera, 4 x 5, six dozen plates, one film camera, 3 1,4 X 4 1,4, twenty five films, one tripod.,,68 This equipment corresponds to the sizes of the glass plate and nitrate negatives examined at LAC. In a report written by Dr. Michele Therrien for the Revillon (Freres) Archives regarding Flaherty's photographic albums,69 Therrien states that photographs were taken at Fort George (Chisasibi) in James Bay (1910-1912); Fort Chimo (Kuujjuaq) in Ungava Bay (1912); Amaduak in the southeast of Baffin Island (1913-1914), Qikiqtait in Hudson Bay (1915-1916) and Port Harrison (Inujjuaq) in Hudson Bay (1920-1921).70

The report also identifies the names of the subjects whose photograph appear in the Revillon Freres albums: Nyla (Alice Nuvalinga), woman in the fillm, Nanook; Canayou (Kanajuq), the girl; Allego, sister ofNyla and Phillipoosie, the child who is holding the bow and arrow in Album

These names appear in the titles of the

photogravures at AGO confirming their identity.

1. Analysis of the negative, photograph and photogravure Flaherty's Inuit portraits appear to conform to two types - "Studio-type" or "confrontation", as proposed by Birnie Danzker in 1979. "Studio-typ~" portraits refer to the conventional practice of portraiture in the nineteenth century; the sitter is "carefully posed, side-lit, occasionally in profile, and their eyes rarely meet the camera.'.72 In "confrontation" portraits, the subject looks directly at the camera, confronting the viewer (examples of "confrontation" portraits are in catalogues 12 and 15). An example of a "studio-type" portrait will be discussed and used to understand Flaherty's method of working and of photographic production from negative to photograph to photogravure. The studio portrait of Sapa, Sikoslingmint Eskimo ofSouthern Baffin Land (Fig.41) displays high-density tonal areas with light directed from the left, lighting the side of the subject's face and shoulder, revealing a fur hood and clothing around one side of his head, shoulder, and chest areas. Upon closer inspection, the photograph is softfocus; that is, no part of the portrait is in sharp focus. The glass plate negative appears to have approximately the same degree of 'blurriness' (fig. 42). The negative also reveals that there was no retouching on the negative to alter the tones of the print. The largest and

most obvious difference between the two is the significant amount of cropping that Flaherty made when he printed the photograph; in the lower right comer of the negative (verso) one can see more background and more of the sitter's right upper arm. Much ofthe 'darkness' surrounding the sitter in the print is explained by the description of Flaherty's "photography studio" as recalled by Simonie, a Baffin Island resident, in an interview with Dorothy Harley Eber, the author of "On Koodjuk's Trail". He recalled a portrait session in 1914: They had to take them inside, in Flaherty's house. I don't recall them having flashes with the camera. They used kerosine lanterns, and I remember three lanterns being placed in special places on the wall. I remember a camera with a cloth that had to go over the head. Maybe that was because they had to prevent any light coming to the photographer's vision. It took a long time before the photographer could actually take a picture. They had to relax him first. The man sitting on the chair had to be very relaxed .. Jfhe was liable to move at all they couldn't take this picture. That's what I remember. 73 The production of these "studio-type" portraits taken inside Flaherty's make-shift studio resulted in photographs that were purposely underexposed, making them appear darker. Also, as this negative (fig. 42) and the other glass plate negatives, such as Unidentified

(Young Woman), Baffin Island (catalogue 1) reveals, the negatives were taken with softfocusing at the time of shooting. It is evident that Flaherty purposely used this technique to produce the effect he wanted. The use of soft-focus photographs is associated with the photographic art movement pictorial ism, which was widely adopted around the end of the nineteenth century.74 The pictorialists favoured this style largely because it the made photographs look more artistic and painterly, but it is unknown when Flaherty adopted this and whose

work had influenced his own photographs. According to the diary of Frances Flaherty, the Flahertys met Edward Curtis and Alfred Steiglitz in New York in April 1915. The meeting with Curtis was related to the Flahertys' attempt to find a distributor for the 1914 film 75 and it was screened alongside Curtis' film of Salish Indians to "an audience of

experts.,,76 At this meeting, they had the opportunity to see that Curtis' portfolios of Indian portraits, which gave Frances Flaherty the idea that the Inuit portraits could be profitable if sold as a portfolio set as we1L 77 Frances Flaherty also described their meeting with Steiglitz at "291" gallery in a slightly later diary entry. The Flahertys had seen Steglitz's periodical Camera Work and they asked him to look at the Inuit portraits. The feedback Stieglitz gave was positive but his reaction doesn't clarifY whether or not the portraits were the pictorialist ones. In comparing the photogravure (fig. 43: catalogue 30) to the photograph, it is very likely that the gravure plate was retouched, as the subject has more highlights on the right side of his face, which appears lighter than in the photograph. However one cannot verifY during which of the five stages of the photogravure process the plate was retouched, since neither the copper plates nor the printing company exist any longer. 78

The three related objects shown here together - negative, photograph and photogravure - demonstrate the production method of Fla..1erty's photographic practice from the period of 1910-1916. He photographed his subjects in a studio environment using a 4 x 5 camera and glass plate negatives. He employed dim lighting to produce an

For printing, the image is enlarged of the negative and closely cropped to the subject's face, omitting the area surrounding the subject's head, upper arm and a bit of his chest. In printing the gravure, the image followed the cropping of the photograph, rather than the full negative?9

Organization of the negatives and dissemination of the photographs and photogravures

At the top left comer of the negative (fig. 2), there is a white piece of paper adhered to the glass, inscribed with the numbers "~" crossed out in black ink. This could possibly be part of the catalogue system that Frances planned as is indicated by an entry in her diary, November 4, 1915, where she wrote (written as ifit were a letter to Flaherty): "The negative of the one I consider your best portrait, far and away above the others, is missing. Small wonder when such wonderful care is taken of them. Your friend Mr. Booth, and I had a conversation on the same subject, both foaming at the mouth, with the result that I am having some boxes made such as he has for his plates, and have plans for a cataloguing system to keep track of them.,,80 Other glass plate negatives examined also have pieces of paper with numbers crossed out. Presumably, they were replaced with a subsequent numbering system as the

80 Ibid, 271.

96

lower right has another alpha-number inscription, "FN2923" which were devised by Frances Flaherty and David Flaherty (Flaherty's brother).81 The number of prints Flaherty made from each negative is unknown because there is not an accurate concordance of his prints in public collections. The vintage prints that exist today are rare, as many are "dispersed and 10st".82 Flaherty gave his photographs away casually, mostly to family, friends and his portrait sitters, and on at least one occasion when he was unable to pay for room and board, he is thought to have given the landlady photographs instead. The photogravure belongs to the portfolio, Camera Studies of the Far North. They were available in sets of six. However, the buyer had the option of choosing six gravures from a choice of eighteen. There is no documentation of how the portfolio was marketed to consumers, but every set included a colophon page or spread (Fig. 48 and Fig. 49: appendix A) which indicated that G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York, were the publishers and distributors of the portfolios. 83

2. Unknown photographs
There are two photographs associated with the Flaherty collection at AGO,
Huskies on Ice (fig.44: catalogue 44) and a four-part panorama of Moose Factory

(catalogue 45). The texture of the Huskies photograph is semi-matte and its surface smoother than the rest of the gelatin silver prints in the collection. While searching through the Visual Indexes of Flaherty's work in the north, I found the same image as the

Huskies. During my visit to LAC, I was able to confmn that the photograph (fig.45) was
deposited at LAC with the rest of the Flaherty works on loan from Claremont and that this photograph appears identical to the one at AGO; the framing is the same and type of photographic paper exhibit the same surface. It is safe to conclude that this photograph in AGO collection was taken by Flaherty.

Four Views of Moose Factory was neither in the Visual Indexes nor in the LAC
collection. However, throughout Flaherty's diaries, he often mentions his stopover in Moose Factory, where he took photographs of the "place and people".84 This 'panorama' (catalogue 43) came to AGO as loose prints kept inside the album of Flaherty photographs, donated by Robb. There is a likelihood that these could have been taken by Flaherty but since this cannot be confmned by any source at this time, the photographer remains unknown.

3. Frances Loring and Florence Wyle photographs
The portraits of Loring and Wyle are very different from the other Flaherty photographs in the AGO collection; there are four cyanotypes, two-toned cyanotypes (brown-toned) and one toned gelatin silver bromide print. 85 The papers are thin and matte. In Frances Loring with Shawl (fig.46: catalogue 47), the edge on the right-side of the print has a white line. This is most likely from the edge of a glass plate negative while contact printing (negative and paper touching one another while being exposed to light). Additionally, the portraits seem to have been trimmed by hand as the edges are uneven. (Fig. 47)

The Estates of the Frances Loring and Florence Wyle donated the group of works, along with many other photographs that are in the AGO Special Collections. The related object (fig. 47) is different from the cyanotype. It is a gelatin silver print, printed on

heavier paper and is likely toned. Compared to this gelatin silver print, the cyanotype image is not centred with a portion of Loring's arm no longer visible. A revealing entry from Frances Flaherty's diary written on July 1915 86 describes her and Flaherty's encounter with Loring and Wyle: "No dinner to get today; we are having it at the studio with the girls. Frances Loring and I met at the Arts and Letters Club last winter [1914].87 She also mentions in the same entry a photograph of Wyle:
"It was their [Loring and Wyle] picture I sent you; Florence Weil[sic] (in the kimono) is

going down the river with US.,,88 It is probable that the photograph she was referring to was one of the three portraits ofWyle (two are with Loring) in the AGO collection (catalogue 49-51). In these photographs, Wyle is dressed in a long wide-sleeve wrap dress that resembles a kimono. This piece of information indicates that all the portraits were likely taken in 1914 or 1915.

Conclusion
This thesis has not only provided detailed and verified information on the fiftyone photographs and photogravures by Robert J. Flaherty at AGO, but has also provided an overview of Flaherty's photography based on secondary literature and drawing upon entries in the Flahertys' diaries from 1910 - 1922. Researchers will now be able to draw upon the catalogue to learn more about the important Flaherty works at AGO. There are still aspects for further research on Flaherty's photographic activity that is documented in his expedition diaries. A thorough investigation of them would uncover more information regarding when the prints were taken, as many of his photographs are still given an eleven year date range, from 19101921, because those were the years that Flaherty travelled to the north. Researchers could also extend my analysis of Flaherty's work in the AGO collection to other related objects at LAC and other collections using this catalogue as the basis. Ideally, this research would result in a catalogue raisonne of all the Flaherty photographs in public institutions around the world, which would indicate where his prints are, as well as how many photographs survives compared to the negatives at LAC on loan from Claremont University.

Appendix A
This appendix documents the portfolio, Camera Studies of the Far North, based on copies at AGO and LAC. The portfolios were published by G.P. Putmans' Sons in 1922; the gravures were printed by The American Gravure Company, N.Y.C.; they were available through G.P Putman's Son's, New York; and the images were copyrighted by

Revillon Freres, N.Y.

The portfolios were sold in two forms: in sets of either six photogravures with a single text page or twelve phtogravures with a fold leaf. There are slight differences between the two versions.

The folded leaf, accompanying the sets with twelve gravures, bears a title on the front (fig. 48) that reads: CAMERA STUDIES OF THE FAR NORTH TWEL VE ENGRAVING OF ESKIMOS AND INDIANS OF THE SUB-ARCTIC ROBERTJ.FLAHERTY F.R.G.S. G.P PUTNAM'S SONS NEW YORK & LONDON 1922 Inside is a text signed by Flaherty describing his photographs (figs. 49 and 50).

The single page colophon, accompanying sets of six photogravures, does not bear the title, Camera Studies oflhe Far North but instead has a text signed by the "Revillon

Freres" which indicates that the "six copper-plate engravings" are from a collection of

104

eighteen. In the lower left comer, there is a small label attached to the page (fig. 52) that reads: "The remaini ng twelve photographs are for sale by G.P . PUTNAM'S SONS th 2 West 45 Street, New York"

The texts describes where Flaherty had taken these images and that the subjects included Nascaupie Indians but mostly "Eskimos" of Eastern Canada and Baffi n Land.

Purchasers were free to select the individual plates for the six and twelve photogravure sets. Since there is no apparent order to the eighteen photogravures, they are simply listed and reproduced here for the fi rst time in thei r entirety.
