Abstract
THERMAL PERFORMANCE OF EXTERIOR ROOF LEVEL AMENITY SPACE IN A COLD CLIMATE ­ A QUANTITATIVE GUIDANCE TOOL FOR LANDSCAPE DESIGN

William Alfred Jesse Williamson Master of Building Science, 2017 Department of Architectural Science, Ryerson University

There are no known studies to quantify the effects of amenity space landscape structures located over habitable space as related to thermal performance. There are three main objectives for investigation in this MRP; Objective 1 ­ Thermal analysis of on-slab wall types, Objective 2 (O2) ­ Thermal analysis of example amenity space using results from O1, and Objective 3 (O3) ­ Recommended details that `work' thermally and functionally. A quantitative methodology was utilized using 1D manual calculation (Glaser method) and 2D computer simulation (THERM) to study three CIP concrete wall conditions and variations which include; 1.0) base line condition, 2.0) modified condition, and 3.0) ultimate condition. Simulation results of O1 indicated that design of landscape walls could improve thermal performance by 55%, O2 found that there was an improvement of 60.5% between the worst and best performing conditions, and O3 recommended two wall variations to be utilized in landscape design which perform thermally and functionally.

1 Introduction
Within the City of Toronto and Greater Toronto Area (GTA), there are hundreds of condominiums, multiuse residential buildings (MURBS), and apartment buildings recently constructed or currently under construction, and this trend has been ongoing for approximately 15 years (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, 2013). Recent statistics from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) state that from January 2016 to October 2016 there were 16,178 units which started construction under the `Apt and Other' category within the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, 2016). Also from the same source, in 2016 there were 12,773 units in `Apt and Other' category of which construction was completed. The previous year 2015, in the Toronto CMA there were 17,054 units which started construction and 29,326 units were completed (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, 2016). If it is presumed that there is an average of 450 units per residential condominium/apartment building, the number of buildings completed in 2015 and in 2016 so far would be ±93.5 (if it is calculated as (12,733 + 29,326) / 450 = 93.46).

Particularly in dense urban environments, there is an increased need to provide usable greenspace for residents and visitors alike. Not all landscape amenity space may be defined as greenspace, as the actual function of said space can vary drastically, but the act of adding vegetation where it is usually not available can have a positive impact on an urban inhabitant's health. There is increasing evidence showing that naturalised environments, or greenspace, located in urban areas are critical to the psychological health of humans and can help to increase feelings of well-being (Almusaed, 2011). Studies have shown that just by simply being near vegetation or naturalized areas, people often feel a calming sense, energized, and an uplifted spirit (Gullone, 2000).

City of Toronto by-laws mandate the required amenity space (interior and/or exterior) as a minimum area measured in square metres (sq.m or m2) that is to be provided as part of a new condominium development (City of Toronto, 2014). Due to this fact, the majority of these residential and/or mixeduse structures have exterior green roof and amenity space installed for the exclusive use of the residents, which would often be located on a podium or roof top level above habitable space. Landscape elements such as planter walls, planter boxes, and trellis features are typically connected structurally to the roof slab to provide lateral strength, regardless of the slab type or roof material.

1

A visual walk around the city will confirm that the most common structural material in Toronto, particularly for mid to high rise building types such as condominiums and apartment buildings, partly due to its flexibility and unique physical properties, is cast-in-place (CIP) concrete. One of the drawbacks of CIP concrete is its thermal properties, with a conductivity of 1.40 W/m·K it is on the higher end for typical building materials (ASHRAE, 2009). The conductivity of CIP Concrete is surpassed by carbon steel at 43.0 W/m·K, which is a material often used for reinforcing of concrete structures (The Engineering Toolbox, 2016). From a landscape architectural perspective, the impacts of green roof amenity space on thermal performance are largely overlooked, unknown, or are unconsidered factors during the design process. Therefore, landscape structures are typically secured to the slab without the use of insulation breaks, which create thermal bridges, examples of this condition can be seen in Figure 1.1 and Figure 1.2 below. In Figure 1.1 the thermal bridge can be seen through the connecting 300 mm wide CIP concrete wall and the top of CIP concrete slab. In Figure 1.2, which was a site plan application (SPA) phase detail, the landscape designer completely missed including the roof slab insulation in their wall detail, the detail also shows a thermal bridge at the 150 mm wide CIP concrete wall and the top of slab, even if the insulation was included in the original detail.

There are no known studies to quantify these effects. This research proposes to study the impacts of amenity space green roof design with thermal bridges and to propose working solutions that can be applied in real-world conditions. Another aspect of this report is to create a potential teaching tool for landscape designers and landscape architects, helping them to be cognisant of how their field of work can negatively or positively impact a building's thermal performance.

2 Background and Preamble
There are a few basic concepts and principles to discuss in order for landscape designers, architectural designers, and anyone else that is unfamiliar with these topics to understand the scope and reasons behind creating this report. This section is important to fill in any introductory `gaps' in the reader's knowledge and to define how the topics listed below are to be understood in this paper. The questions/sections to be explored further include; a) What are Green Roofs?, b) Heat Transfer in Green Roofs ­ What is Thermal Conduction?, and c) What is Landscape Amenity Space above Habitable Space?

2.1 What are Green Roofs?
There are three main types of green roofs; extensive, semi-intensive, and intensive (see Table 2-1 below). Each type of green roof can have many different variations in each category including soil types, drainage layers, filter mediums, and planting varieties (Sutton, 2015). Figure 2.1 below depicts an example of a green roof cross section, showing the typical layers that should be detailed. Figure 2.1 depicts a standard roofing system (where the waterproofing is located above the insulation layer), the details in this research project utilize an inverted roofing system (where the waterproofing is located below the insulation layer). The most basic difference between extensive and intensive green roofs is the depth of the growing medium, also called engineered substrate or planting soil (Sutton, 2015). In an existing building, the primary reason to select an extensive green roof system is often structural related. At 73.2 to 122.1 kg/sq.m (15 to 25 lbs/sq.ft), extensive green roofs are better suited for retrofit applications where both dead and live loads are a concern (Green Roof Technology, 2016). Whereas, in a new building an intensive green roof can be accommodated for structurally during the design phase and can allow the landscape designer to select a greater variation in a planting palette. However, structural conditions and/or concerns are not the only consideration in selecting a green roof type.

3

Other variables include overall suitability for the project, cost, aesthetics, water retention or stormwater management capacity, and maintenance (Weiler & Scholz-Barth, 2009). In an extensive green roof the growing medium is typically around 75 mm to 125 mm thick and it is planted with sedum, mosses, or small grasses (see Table 2-1 below). Whereas, an intensive green roof will often have growing medium depths of 175 mm to 600 mm for shrubs, grasses, and perennials and upwards of 900 mm to 1200 mm depth or greater for large shrubs and trees (Green Roof Technology, 2016). Semi-intensive green roofs tend to be in the ranges between extensive and intensive with depths of 125 mm to 175 mm for the growing medium and could be planted with sedum, ornamental grasses, or perennials (see Table 2-1 below).

For the purpose of this study, the focus will be on intensive green roofs with a soil depth of ±700 mm only. Intensive green roofs were selected for this study because they are often used in amenity space design and can facilitate a wider variety of wall designs as well as many different varieties of vegetation. The next section/question will provide a simplified description of heat transfer in green roofs focusing on what is relevant to the approach of this research paper.

2.2 Heat Transfer in Green Roofs ­ What is Thermal Conduction?
The actual heat transfer mechanisms in green roofs are quite complicated (see Figure 2.2 below), and are subject to various external and internal variables such as geographical location, elevation, solar radiation, precipitation, wind and pressure, vegetation density, building mechanical devices (internal air conditioning), and occupant use, to name a few (Sutton, 2015). There are many ongoing and previously completed studies within various scientific fields to quantify performance variables of green roofs both mathematically and experimentally, but these studies are usually focused on the actual green roofs themselves (Theodosiou, 2009). Though this report is focused on how landscape structures affect thermal performance of a building in amenity space areas, the adjacency of green roof and paving systems cannot be ignored. Due to this fact and because the topic of green roofs is relevant to this research, some studies will be explored further in the literature review portion of this report (see Section 4 below).

Figure 2.2 ­ The Energy Balance for a Green Roof (Theodosiou, 2009)

The study of heat transfer in buildings is a focus of the field of building science, or building physics. There are three primary physical methods which facilitate heat transfer within a building; conduction, convection, and radiation (Hens, 2007). Conduction is the heat transfer mechanism of focus in this study, it relates directly to thermal bridges and the green roof landscape amenity design in this report. Cengel (2007) defines conduction as "The transfer of energy from the more energetic particles of a substance to the adjacent less energetic ones as a result of interactions between the particles" and "The rate of heat conduction through a solid is directly proportional to its thermal conductivity". The rate of heat transfer by conduction between building elements are defined by a materials conductivity [k] (see Figure 2.3 and Figure 2.4 below) or resistance [Rsi] values. The units for conductivity are defined as W/m·K and for resistance are defined as m2·K/W (Cengel, 2007). Basically, the higher the k value for a given material, the greater the heat transmission will be through conduction, and the higher the Rsi value for a given material the lower the heat transmission is through conduction. Thermal conductivity is also related to temperature. Generally in gases conductivity increases as the temperature increases, whereas in liquids and solids conductivity tends to decrease as temperature increases (Cengel, 2007).

Figure 2.3 ­ Conductive Heat Flow Through Copper (Cengel, 2007)

Figure 2.4 ­ Conductive Heat Flow Through Silicon (Cengel, 2007)

The software application THERM, which is utilized for this study, provides an output with a numerical heat transfer coefficient value called a U-factor or U-value (Mitchell, et al., 2013). The units defined for U-factor values are W/m2·K. Essentially, the lower the U-factor value, the higher the resistance values are within the system. Cengel (2007) defines this value as "The rate of heat loss through a unit surface area of a window per unit temperature difference between the indoors and the outdoors is called the Ufactor". THERM was initially designed to analyse the thermal performance of windows, but is often employed for other building analysis purposes as it can be customized to simulate a wide variety of twodimensional (2D) applications where thermal bridges are a concern (Lawrence Berkeley National
6

Laboratory, 2016). Other aspects of the program THERM will be explored further in other sections of this report (see Section 6.1 below).

The relationship of thermal conductivity, thermal conductance, and resistance can be defined by the equations and units below:

Thermal conductivity [k] ->

Units: Metric ­ W/m·K Imperial ­ BTU·in/(hr·ft2 °F)

Thermal conductance [C] ->

Units: Metric ­ W/m2·K Imperial ­ BTU/(hr·ft2 °F) Equation -> C = conductivity / thickness = k / t Units: Metric ­ m2·K/W Imperial ­ (hr·ft2 °F)/BTU

Thermal resistance [Rsi] -> Equation -> Rsi = 1 / conductance = 1 / C Heat transfer coefficient [U-factor, U] ->

Units: Metric ­ W/m2·K Imperial ­ Btu/h·ft2·°F

This section describing thermal conductance should highlight why it is not advisable to use materials with high conductivity in building envelope construction, particularly if there is no continuous insulating layer to break the thermal connection from the interior to the exterior or from the exterior to the interior. The next section describes landscape amenity space and habitable space.

2.3 What is Landscape Amenity Space above Habitable Space?
Building Science Corporation (2016) defines habitable space as "Building space intended for continual human occupancy. Such space generally includes areas used for living, sleeping, dining and cooking, but does not generally include bathrooms, toilets, hallways, storage areas, closets, or utility rooms". For the purpose of this report, the definition of habitable space is expanded to include any interior air conditioned space in a building as mentioned above and also including any circulation or storage areas where there is potential for interior and exterior thermal differences. This essentially means that habitable space requires the necessity of an enclosed or continuous thermal barrier to regulate internal and external temperature variation and reduce unwanted heat transmission.

7

Figure 2.5 ­ Amenity Space Example (Urban Toronto [a], 2016)

Figure 2.6 ­ Amenity Space Example (Urban Toronto [b], 2016)

Landscape amenity space refers to any exterior roof top area of which is accessible to a building's residents and typically provided for their exclusive use (see Figure 2.5 and Figure 2.6 above). Particularly in dense urban environments, amenity space becomes increasingly important as easy access to safe parks, green space, or clean and uncrowded facilities can be limited. Amenity space often includes, but is certainly not limited to, areas for eating, socializing, lounging, swimming, sun tanning, barbequing, sporting facilities, etc., and usually incorporates a green roof component of some sort. These exterior spaces are typically located on a podium level, often between three to five storeys high, or located on a roof top level in low to midrise buildings (ex. <20 storeys) due to high wind loads and uplift pressure at higher roof levels (see Figure 2.7 and Figure 2.8 below). High velocity winds and uplift pressures can create dangerous and uncomfortable conditions, particularly at the edges of high rise buildings, which is why amenity space is often relegated to the lower levels of a building and/or proper precautions must be taken to ensure occupant safety at higher levels (Sutton, 2015). For this report, the example amenity space (see Section 5, Figure 5.1 below, p. 15) is assumed to be at the roof top level above the podium and located between 3 to 5 storeys in height.

However, though the focus of this report is on condominium or apartment building exterior amenity space in particular. The topic is relevant to other typologies such as office buildings, hotels, or other commercial structures that include at-grade plazas (ex. CIBC building at Yonge St and Queen St E in downtown Toronto) or any other usable roof top areas, if they are located above habitable space and thus requiring thermal protection. As such, the recommendations in this report could be applied to a broader area of application than strictly landscape amenity space for condominiums and/or apartment buildings. The next section includes questions that were formulated to guide this research.

3 Research Questions
In order to confront the issues relating to the proposed scope of this report, a list of research questions was generated to further define the direction in which to proceed:

1. Is improved thermal design of green roof landscape structures able to assist in regulating building energy performance? 2. Can an integrative approach to green roof design help to involve landscape designers in decisions relating to building energy performance?

4 Literature Review
As noted in the introduction section above, there are no known studies to quantify the effects of landscape walls incorporating thermal bridges and their impacts on amenity space green roof designs. This represents a gap in the existing scientific knowledge on the topic of thermal bridges, a part of which is intended to be completed by the creation of this report. There exists significant literature on green roofs of all types (ex. extensive, semi-intensive, and intensive), some of which will be discussed. There also exists significant literature on quantifying the impact of thermal bridges in building details; walls, windows, doors, balconies, parapets, foundations, to name a few, some of which will also be discussed in this section where they are relevant to this study. Literature relating to manual calculation methods and computer simulation software will also be briefly explored. There is a section in this report (see Section 7.1.1 below, p. 21) which explains specific materials and their properties as they relate to the simulations in this study, so an overview of thermal materials science will not be discussed here. Due to the large quantity of literature on the topics to be reviewed in this section, only a select few documents will be explored as they are relevant and this section is not intended to represent an exhaustive review of all existing topics. The primary focus of this literature review (where possible) will be focused on thermal properties as it effects CIP concrete landscape walls, which is the focus of this research paper.

The Morrison Hershfield (2011) report titled Thermal Performance of Building Envelope Details for Midand High-Rise Buildings (1365-RP) contains one example of a thermal study which is similar to Condition 1 (see Section 6.1 below, p. 16, for more information), and they attained a U-value of 0.65 W/m2·K for their condition labelled as `Detail 21' (see Figure 4.1 below). As quoted from their report "Detail 21 is an insulated concrete roof with a concrete curb or wall bypassing the roof insulation. The thermal transmittance, for a roof 6.1 m (20 ft) long, is increased 56% compared to the nominal (1D) value of the roof" (Morrison Hershfield, 2011). Their detail is quite similar to the non-thermally broken wall conditions to be considered in this report, but as can be seen in Figure 4.1 below, they do not include roof ballast, an intensive green roof, or a paving surface in their simulation.

In his research project relating to thermal transmission in balcony slabs, Murad's (2015) computer simulation models found that utilizing Schöck Isokorb® was able to reduce 7% overall energy loss for the study building (Murad, 2015). The content in this report provides an indication of the effects of thermal bridging in green roof areas, as the roof slab surface area is small compared to the surface area of a building's façade and/or balcony protrusions. Therefore, roof areas in a building likely represent a minimal percentage of overall energy flow (ex. even less than 7%). However, the overall percentage of a buildings energy flow due to landscape walls is not the particular concern or focus of this report and it will also not be calculated. What is important is to find areas where energy flow is happening, and to reduce and/or minimize them as much as possible in order to fill in one more gap in the thermal performance of a buildings envelope.

Lawton & Roppel (2014) write a Morrison Hershfield report on details and analysis of thermal bridges including manual calculation formulae, the report is relating to an existing product used to provide thermal breaks on balconies. The manufacturer is Schöck and the product is Isokorb® type CM (p. 20 of their report), which is claimed to be able to reduce the thermal conductivity [k] in balcony slabs by 92% (see Figure 4.2 and Figure 4.3 below). They also refer to utilizing the International Standard (ISO) 14683 document which contains manual calculation methods for thermal bridges of various types for their report (International Organization for Standardization (ISO), 2015). Isokorb® of all types utilize stainless steel for the reinforcing portion running through the rigid insulated thermal break. This is because stainless steel has a lower conductivity value at 16.00 W/m·K than carbon steel at 43.00 W/m·K, thereby reducing the thermal bridging effect of reinforcing. Schöck Isokorb rigid insulation (RI) thickness can be customized to suit an application and the required thermal conditions requested by the designer (Schöck USA Inc., 2015). It is possible that by customizing an Isokorb product, if it was needed for a
11

landscape application, that it would increase the price per unit, and this is a factor that would have to be considered during the design phase.

The Becker & Wang (2011) study titled Green Roof Heat Transfer and Thermal Performance Analysis provides a summary of green roof thermal performance as well as including experimental data to reinforce their research results. Their report was focused on quantifying the effects of conductive heat transfer of retrofitted green roofs installed on existing buildings in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The results of their study found that on the first green roof, Hamerschlag Hall during 2009 and 2010, an average of 26% less heat was lost during the heating months from the installed green roof than was lost from the control roof with conventional roofing located at Porter Hall (Becker & Wang, 2011). They also found for the same years in the green roof and control roof at Allegheny County Office Building (ACOB), there was an average of 8.2% reduction in heat loss in heating months and a 75% reduction in heat gain in cooling months. Their results indicate that the installed green roofs reduced conductive heat gain and loss, and thus can provide positive benefits in urban locations. They note that further studies must be completed to analyze other modes of heat transfer and building energy modeling to assess actual economic savings (Becker & Wang, 2011).

Oberndorfer et al. (2007) highlights the importance and impact of green roofs in urban areas. Their report cites the specific benefits of green roof technology including stormwater management and reduction, improvement in air quality, regulation of building temperatures, reduction in urban heat island effect, and increased urban wildlife habitat (Oberndorfer, et al., 2007). They expand these topics further and discuss the history of green roofs, compare types of green roofs, explore ecosystem services
12

provided, discuss urban habitat values, postulate community and landscape properties, and conclude with a section outlining future research directions. In future work, they conclude that research should focus on plant selection for various climate regions, methods to improve air and water quality, robust cost-benefit models to advise if the technology is effective, and more research on the role of biodiversity in living-roof performance (Oberndorfer, et al., 2007). Though the focus of this research paper does not necessarily apply specifically to urban areas, MURBS and apartment buildings tend to be built primarily in high density urban areas.

Though manual 2D thermal bridge calculations are out of the scope of this report, a few articles were found that could be useful for possible future work relating to this topic and to test the 2D computer simulation models. In Blomberg's (1996) thesis titled Heat conduction in two and three dimensions: Computer modelling of building physics applications, he describes numerical formulations to be utilized for computer simulations. He also outlines that "the robust method of explicit finite differences" is the method utilized for the computer simulations in which closely follows the physical equations (Blomberg, 1996). This is an older paper, so some of the methods may be somewhat outdated or unrefined, but it is quite exhaustive in describing the process of thermal bridge calculations and methodology, so it is worth a mention here. Nyberg (2011) wrote a thesis titled Thermal bridges at foundations: Evaluation of heat calculation methods, which contains examples of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) manual calculation methods that are then compared to HEAT2 and HEAT3 computer simulations. The purpose stated for his report was to "analyze and verify the specific calculation methods used in SS-EN ISO 13370:2007 and SS-EN ISO 10211:2007 to calculate heat loss to the ground" and to "minimize the spread and error of the results" (Nyberg, 2011). It was noted that there was 5% deviation when comparing the 2D and 3D models, but when certain dimensional parameters were modified, the deviations between the two models increased to 10% (Nyberg, 2011). It was suggested that standardizing variables and future work could help to reduce these variations.

ISO/DIS (2015) standard 14683 which "deals with simplified methods for determining heat flows through linear thermal bridges which occur at junctions of building elements", contains formulae and standards to calculate linear thermal bridges. The ISO report is titled Thermal bridges in building construction - Linear thermal transmittance - Simplified methods and default values, and it contains manual calculation methods for thermal bridges of various types including roofs, balconies, corners, intermediate floors, internal walls, slab-on ground floors, suspended ground floors, pillars, and window
13

and door openings (International Organization for Standardization (ISO), 2015). This is a different ISO standard as studied by Nyberg (2011), but the amount of varied details studied makes it a potential source of manual calculation methods for future work related to this report. Lastly, Hutcheon & Handegord (1995) in their book Building Science for a Cold Climate, provide materials data and calculation methods for the Glaser method as utilized to test the computer model in this report. They define their seminal book as "a growing body of knowledge increasingly being defined as `building science'" (Hutcheon & Handegord, 1995). This book is still specified as required reading at Ryerson University in the Building Science department, highlighting the importance of the information contained therein. The next section below outlines the three objectives of this report.

5 Objectives
To quantify thermal performance and provide indications of energy movement in landscape amenity space areas when located over habitable space with a focus on `typical' and `modified' structural details (ex. CIP concrete walls) and intensive green roof. The overall research goal is to provide scalable results for analytical use in amenity space and green roof design.

In this report there will be three main objectives for investigation: Objective 1 (O1) ­ Thermal analysis of on-slab wall types Objective 2 (O2) ­ Thermal analysis of example amenity space using results from O1 Objective 3 (O3) ­ Recommended details that `work' thermally and functionally

A simplified landscape plan that is representative of a `typical' amenity space design (located in downtown Toronto) has been created to provide a quantifiable metric of a possible real world application for this study (see Figure 5.1 below). The study area is defined with a dashed line and a note, it can be described as extending from the outside face of the building to the inside face of all the parapet walls. It could be said that a theoretical plan as shown below would bring up too many other design questions relating to the buildings program, function, envelope, use, to name a few. To provide some legitimacy to the conceptual `typical' amenity space provided in this report, it should be noted that it is actually quite similar to the design of a future building planned in the west end of Toronto, the author is one of the current landscape designers in the early stages of the project.

Total Area = 386.9 m2, Conc. wall = 67.6 lin.m (20.3 m2), Paving (conc.) = 291.5 m2, Planting bed = 75.1 m2

This report at its foundation is a research project but it also contains significant design aspects, and should be considered an investigation into both research and design. Generally, if completed properly, there is much less ambiguity within scientific research projects, which must follow the scientific method precisely and they must also be replicable. While design on the other hand, much like art, is subjective and can be open to interpretation. All efforts will be made to remove any ambiguity within this report and any background information will be provided to validate or explain the ideas postulated within. The following section outlines the methodology and approach for this research paper.

15

6 Methodology and Approach
6.1 Methodology
It is proposed to employ a quantitative methodology using manual calculation (Glaser method) and computer simulation (THERM) of thermal conditions to create measurable and scalable metrics for use in landscape amenity space and green roof design (Hutcheon & Handegord, 1995). The Glaser method will be used for one-dimensional (1D) thermal conditions, appropriate manual calculation methods for 2D thermal bridges are out of the scope of this study. The software choice for this study is THERM 6.3.46 created by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 2016). The particular version selected is not the most current version, but was the National Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC) certified version of the software (which expired on 2016-05-01 for new certification and re-certification while writing this report) (National Fenestration Rating Council, 2016). A review of the differences between THERM 6.3.46 and THERM 7.4.3, the current version, indicated that the updates to the software were not particularly related to the focus of this research, so it was decided to continue with version 6.3.46 (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 2016). Other software such as HEAT2 by BLOCON Sweden was considered, but the strength of the THERM application is that it has the required functions for this study, utilizes external standards validation, is free to use, and has a relatively simple learning curve (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 2016).

This study proposes to consider three thermal conditions of landscape walls (design details) over an inverted roof system for comparative analysis (see Figure 6.1 and Figure 6.2 below): Condition 1 ­ Standard: CIP concrete roof slab with doweled in CIP concrete retaining wall Condition 2 ­ Improved: CIP concrete roof slab with doweled in thermally broken CIP concrete retaining wall o It is proposed to implement the product Schöck Isokorb®, a similar product, or a design that has a similar effect of the product, possibly using standard high density rigid insulation with holes punctured for reinforcing to pass through at an appropriate spacing (Schöck USA Inc., 2015). Schöck Isokorb® is designed for use in a few different building applications including thermally broken parapets and balconies, there is little reason to assume that it would not be appropriate for this study condition or real world application (Lawton & Roppel, 2014).
16

-

Condition 3 ­ Ultimate: CIP concrete roof slab with thermally broken CIP concrete retaining wall o For this condition the layout of the wall in plan would typically require a shape with at least 3 to 4 sides to create lateral support as there is no doweled connection to the slab.

Figure 6.1 ­ Detailed Section Drawings of Three Thermal Conditions

Figure 6.2 ­ Simplified Section Drawings of Three Thermal Conditions for Simulation

Static winter and summer conditions are selected for this study, as it is considered that this is when some of the greatest temperature variations would generally occur. The atmospheric temperature conditions of the study (static), where T = temperature, are: Summer; o o Winter; o o Interior condition; Twi = 23 °C Exterior condition; Two = -15 °C
17

Interior condition; Tsi = 23 °C Exterior condition; Tso = 27 °C

Further to this, dynamic temperature variations are not included in this study, only the static summer and winter conditions as outlined are selected for simulation. However, because radiation is also not considered in this study, an additional range of more extreme temperature variations will be explored in Objective 2 to further assess the thermal performance of the example landscape amenity space design (see Section 9.3 below, p. 52). Basically, the example amenity space in a real-world condition would be exposed to heating by solar radiation during daylight hours and subsequent cooling during the evening and overnight hours, the intensity of which will vary depending on geographical location, temperature, orientation, and exposure. The reason for including further temperature variations in O2 as examples is to simply assess, with the simulation tools as utilized, how radiation or more extreme weather conditions could affect thermal performance and to provide an additional metric for contemplation.

The conditions outlined above should be thought of as; 1.0) a base line condition, 2.0) a modified condition, and 3.0) ways to avoid thermal bridges completely (see Figure 6.1 and Figure 6.2 above). The variations of these conditions will be described in this section. In Table 6-1 below, the three thermal conditions are expanded to create and describe variations to be utilized in the Objective 1 computer simulations (see Section 8 below). There are a few items varied for these conditions and they include; reinforcing, the slab insulation thickness (100 mm, 125 mm, and 150 mm thick), the wall insulation layer (50 mm, 25 mm thick, and none), CIP concrete wall width or thickness (300 mm, 200 mm, 250 mm, and 400 mm wide), and a variation on the paving surface (70 mm thick precast concrete unit paving on a 25 mm thick sand setting bed). These condition variations are designated based on the author's knowledge and personal experience with landscape design and amenity space design. For example, in Condition X.1 (see Table 6-1 below), 100 mm thickness is often used for the rigid insulation layer at the slab and it can provide an approximate Rsi value of 3.52 (R20 in imperial), which of course varies by manufacturer (Owens Corning, 2011). In Ontario, the minimum Rsi value to be provided in an assembly is mandated by the Ontario Building Code (OBC) (Ontario Ministry of Housing, 2015).

Due to the complexity of estimating reinforcing in a wall to suit all conditions, the quantity of which is dependent on various factors (retaining height of the wall, thickness of the wall, specific structural engineer to review drawings, etc.), it was decided to not include it in the majority of the simulations but to assess it as one variable in each condition. Condition X.2 was created to simulate the effects of reinforcing in the wall in order to compare it to Condition X.1 and assess how reinforcing can create additional thermal bridging and focus heat flux. In Conditions X.3 and X.4 the architect or building
18

envelope consultant may decide to specify a thicker insulation layer to provide a higher Rsi value which these conditions employ, the landscape wall thickness remains the same at 300 mm wide. Conditions X.5 and X.6 are variations of the wall insulation values at 25 mm thickness and none. Rigid insulation along the interior face of the planter wall is applied to reduce frost susceptibility of vegetation during cold weather and to help protect established root systems during the winter months. Conditions X.7, X.8, and X.9 are variations of the wall from 300 mm to 200 mm, 250 mm, and 400 mm in width, due to the fact that landscape designers often employ various widths for both function and aesthetics. The final Condition variation X.10 substitutes the CIP concrete paving with precast concrete unit paving, another typical paving material often seen in landscape design.

It should also be stated that different light conditions (ex. sunlight, shade cover from trees, shade from other buildings, etc.), soil moisture content, and granular moisture content, although important for green roof and amenity space design, will not be included in these simulations. These condition variations as described are simulated to quantify the effects of amenity space landscape structures over habitable space.

7 Simulation ­ Testing the Model
The initial stage to simulating the three proposed conditions and their variations is to create a manual calculation of a sample model which is broken up into 1D systems (see section 7.2 below) that can be used to compare with the accuracy of the 1D and 2D computer simulation (see section 7.3 below). For this study it was decided to use the model named `cond_01-06', which is listed as `Standard w/ No Wall Insulation' (see Section 8.1.1, Table 8-1 below, p. 37). This condition (cond_01-06) was selected as the test model because it does not include the planter wall insulation, which would unnecessarily complicate the division of the systems and would likely not add much of benefit to the final results of the comparison test. After considering these factors, the testing was completed in two stages; 1) to manually calculate the 1D model using the Glaser Method and 2) to split the computer model into both 1D and 2D systems and simulate to compare to the manual model. The first step is to define the materials and conductivity values to be used in the manual and computer simulations in Section 7.1 below.

7.1 Materials and Systems for Testing the Model
To create any simulation, either manual or computer, assumptions must be made to simplify the model and to extrapolate where needed in order to resolve any unknown variables. Table 7-2 below (p. 25) is a list of materials and their thermal properties as relevant to the simulation models. Chapter 26 titled "Heat, Air, and Moisture Control in Building Assemblies--Material Properties" in ASHRAE Fundamentals 2009 includes material conductivity data for various typical building materials (ASHRAE, 2009). To be consistent, the ASHRAE fundamentals chapter will be used to delineate as many values as possible for this report, and other sources and extrapolation will be adapted to fill in the gaps as required. In order to define the conductivity [k] values for a few of the less common or undefined building materials, a few assumptions were made and are as described and defined in the section below.

7.1.1 Materials for Testing the Model
Material assumptions and selections for testing the model and further simulations are described in this section. For CIP concrete, the k value does not include reinforcing steel. As previously outlined, reinforcing variables are too difficult to define for the specific purpose of this study. Reinforcing
21

variables can depend on factors such as wall height, wall thickness, density required, and spacing. Due to this fact, reinforcing is not considered in the majority of the models and was only simulated to compare cond_0X-01 and cond_0X-02 in each condition series to ascertain the effects of one example reinforcing layout. Studies were completed to compare walls at non-reinforced cross sections and at reinforcing cross sections including; cond_01-01, cond_01-02, cond_02-01, cond_02-02, cond_03-01, and cond_03-02 (see Section 8.1.1, Table 8-1, p. 37).

Granular `A' values were extrapolated from ASHRAE Fundamentals (2009) and Koliji's (2013) Geotechdata.info website. It was decided to select the limestone k value of 1.2 W/m·K from ASHRAE material conductivity data tables (Chapter 26) and void density derived from Geotechdata.info at 30% for granular `A'. It was then calculated to find k at 0.84 W/m·K for Granular `A', air or moisture content were not included in the value (Koliji, 2013). Granular `A' void content is slightly lower than granular `O' (clear stone), as outlined below, due to the presence of fines.

Granular `O' (Clear Stone) values were also extrapolated from ASHRAE (2009) and Koliji's (2013) Geotechdata.info website. It was decided to again select the limestone k value of 1.2 W/m·K from ASHRAE material conductivity data tables (Chapter 26) and void density derived from Geotechdata.info at 35% for granular `O'. It was then calculated to find k at 0.78 W/m·K for Granular `O', air or moisture content were also not included in the value (Koliji, 2013). Granular `O' (clear stone) void content is slightly higher than granular `A' due to the absence of fines.

When considering soil, there is also no simple k value to assign, it is a highly inconsistent material dependent on many variables including moisture and the specific soil type. Soil is also composed of materials with different conductivity values; gravel, sand, silt, clay, and peat (Sutton, 2015). Conductivity values are also dependent on moisture content, mineral composition, particle sizes, organic components, density/compaction, temperature, and solar exposure, to name a few (Becker & Wang, 2011). Based on the variables of these properties, soil conductivities ranging between 0.15 W/m·K to 4.0 W/m·K have been assigned to various soil types as in ASHRAE (2009) and The Engineering Toolbox (2016). For the purpose of this report a value of 0.95 W/m·K has been assumed based on Table 7-1 below (Table 5 from ASHRAE Fundamentals) under loams defining the lower end value for summer conditions and the higher end value of 2.25 W/m·K for winter conditions (ASHRAE, 2009).

22

Table 7-1 ­ Table 5; Typical Apparent Thermal Conductivity Values for Soils, W/(m·K) (ASHRAE, 2009)

Another factor to support these different k values in summer and winter for soil is moisture and ice content. From The Engineering Toolbox (2016), a conductivity value for water is defined as 0.58 W/m·K and for ice the conductivity value is 2.18 W/m·K. What this implies is that due to water content the conductivity of soil could be lowered and with ice content it could be increased, hence the lower k value assigned to summer condition and higher k value assigned to winter conditions as described above and in Table 7-2 (p. 25) listing materials for the simulation. Figure 7.1 below further highlights the effects of moisture content in different types of soil as well as providing evidence of the importance of grading (drainage) in soil affecting thermal conductivity.

Figure 7.1 ­ Figure 6; Trends of Apparent Thermal Conductivity for Moist Soils (ASHRAE, 2009)

23

Regarding soil, it should be noted that the depth of the growing medium and soil characteristics (ex. particle size, moisture content, air content, organic content, granular/sand content, density/compaction, etc.), as mentioned above, will affect the thermal properties of the layer and because of this the more dynamic nature of growing medium properties is also outside of the scope of this report.

For the extruded polystyrene (XPS) rigid foam insulation, two different ASHRAE k values were selected for the wall and slab insulation, the lower value of 0.022 W/m·K was assigned to the slab insulation and 0.03 W/m·K for the wall insulation (ASHRAE, 2009). Considering the typical sequence of construction, the landscape contractor and associated landscape trades would usually install the wall rigid insulation after the slab insulation and would likely use a different product as specified by landscape designers or provided by landscape contractors. In a built project, it is also possible that the wall rigid insulation could be the same type and specification as the slab insulation. However, for the purpose of this report and thermal design issues, it was decided to place k value precedence on the slab insulation.

Other wall materials than what are defined in this section could conceivably provide better k values than CIP concrete, for example natural stone gravity walls, walls with stone cladding, or solid wood walls. A few wall thicknesses will be explored as it is common for the thickness to vary depending on the aesthetics or function of the CIP concrete wall as designed, however for this report other wall materials or walls with cladding are not considered

As with most computer simulations, there a few building materials not included in this study to simplify the model. To simplify the condition models for the simulations in this study, waterproofing, protection board, filter fabric, and root barrier layers are not included. Due to the minimal thickness and/or porosity of these materials it was not assumed that they would contribute drastically to thermal performance for this study. As outlined in Section 6.1 above (p. 16), dynamic temperature variations are also not included in this study. THERM does not contain dynamic simulation capabilities, so any other temperature variations would have to be manually input and the amount of time required to perform the multitude of separate simulations makes the task out of the scope of this report.

Note that, in the systems outlined above, the width (shown under the system headings) of each system is not a factor in the 1D manual calculations, as they only consider the material thickness to determine the conductivity and/or resistance of a given material. For the computer simulation, the same systems will be utilized, but the study will be completed for both 1D and 2D variations to assess how the addition of another dimension can affect the heat flow through a condition split into systems. First, some of assumptions and equations of the manual calculations are outlined in the section below.

7.2 Testing the Model ­ Manual Calculation
For the manual calculation a few assumptions and exclusions were made to simplify the 2D model into a 1D model. The numerical model is simplified with the assumptions outlined below; Steady state conditions. Solar radiation is not considered. Heat flux (flow) is taken as uni-directional, perpendicular to the air flow. Interior room temperature is 23 degrees Celsius.

The manual calculation results for each system (systems as outlined in Section 7.1.2 above) and atmospheric variations are shown in the tables below.

As was expected when considering basic heat transfer principles, the lowest U-factor values can be seen in the insulated portions of the systems, while the highest U-values are through the uninsulated CIP concrete wall system (see Table 7-2 above). For comparison purposes, the U-values were averaged for each system and seasonal variation, and the results are the same for both at 0.432 W/m2·K. After reporting these results, the 1D manual calculation numbers will be compared to the 1D and 2D results from the computer simulations in the next section.

7.3 Testing the Model ­ Computer Simulation
For the computer simulation test, the study was completed for both 1D (separated) and 2D (combined) variations. This was completed to assess if the 1D model matches the manual calculation and to further ascertain how the addition of another dimension (2D) can affect the heat flux through the systems and what the overall result could be. Figure 7.3 and Figure 7.4 below depict the isotherms of the separated simulated models for each system (paving, wall, and soil) in summer and winter conditions respectively.

Figure 7.5 and Figure 7.6 below depict the isotherms from the simulated models for each system (paving, wall, and soil) combined as one 2D model for both summer and winter conditions respectively. As mentioned previously, these conditions were simulated as combined models to ascertain how the adjacency of 2D elements affect the heat flux of each system (when compared to the 1D separated models, see Figure 7.3 and Figure 7.4 above).

31

Figure 7.5 ­ Condition 1.6 Systems Combined - Standard w/ No Wall Insulation, Summer

Figure 7.6 ­ Condition 1.6 Systems Combined - Standard w/ No Wall Insulation, Winter

After simulating these separated and combined system models for Condition 1.6 (cond_01-06) the results will be compared and assessed in the next section.

7.3.1 Computer Simulation ­ Results
Similar to the manual calculations, and again as expected, the lowest U-factor values can be seen in the insulated portions of the systems, while the higher U-values are in the CIP concrete wall system. For comparison purposes, the U-values in the separated computer model were also averaged, and the results are 0.4284 W/m2·K for summer and 0.4375 W/m2·K for winter (see Table 7-10 below). If this is compared to the 0.432 W/m2·K for summer and winter in the manual calculation, the results only differ by 0.83% for summer and 1.25% for winter. Based on these results, it is relatively safe to say that the 1D manual and computer simulation models are accurate in comparison to each other. However, if a reason was to be postulated for the variation, it is likely with the way that THERM subdivides the model into a finite element mesh. The process of creating an element mesh for thermal modeling is similar to how 3D modeling programs of games create simplified visual representations of rounded and curved shapes by subdividing them into many triangular, square, or distorted polygonal shaped objects (Edelsbrunner, 2001). When viewed from a distance or zoomed out on a computer screen, the 3D mesh object would appear to be smooth, depending on the density of the mesh. In computer simulated thermal modeling, finite element mesh subdivides the model into smaller portions which can be more easily calculated, the results of which are then combined to give a final result.

In the computer simulated (CS) combined model, the results of each system vary quite substantially from the separated CS model (see Figure 7.7 below). The results of the paving and soil systems (cond_01-06_x_paving and cond_01-06_x_soil) vary in the range of 54.0% to 56.0% while the wall systems (cond_01-06_x_wall) are in the range of 6.0% to 12.0% in difference. The range of the variation between these two simulations and their systems is likely due to differences of physically separating the 1D model (Figure 7.3 and Figure 7.4 above, p. 31) and then comparing those results to the 2D combined models (Figure 7.5 and Figure 7.6 above, p. 32). The total or average U-factor for both the separated and combined (cond_01-06_x_total) models varies in the range of 8.0% to 12.5%. Based on these values, it can be seen that there is much less variation in the averaged and total U-factor values (cond_01-06_x_total) when compared and there is much more variation seen in the systems (cond_0106_x_paving, cond_01-06_x_soil, and cond_01-06_x_wall) when compared to each other in the separated and combined CS models.

7.4 Testing the Model ­ Manual Calculation and Computer Simulation Analysis
The compiled results of the manual calculations and computer simulations from the previous sections are shown in Table 7-11 and Figure 7.8 below. The differences between the manual calculations and separated model CS as previously discussed are also shown in Figure 7.8. There is minimal variation in Manual Calculation and Separated Model (CS) categories under cond_01-06_s_total and cond_0106_w_total. The primary differences can be seen when comparing the Manual Calculation and Separated Model (CS) category results to the Combined Model (CS) category results under cond_0106_s_total and cond_01-06_w_total. The compared differences of those models are in the range of 8.0% to 12.5% and are believed to be derived from system adjacency and 2D heat flux through the wall structure/system which is graphically depicted as isotherms in Figure 7.5 and Figure 7.6 above (see Section 7.3, p. 30).

Based on the compiled results in Figure 7.8, testing the model appears to be successful in confirming the validity of the computer models. The next portion of this report, Objective 1, will be to simulate all the conditions and variations outlined in Table 8-1, and to analyse the results.

8 Objective 1: Computer Simulation of Condition Variations
After confirming the relative accuracy of the models by manual calculation and computer simulation, this section is where the final simulations will be modeled and the results will be quantified, analysed, and compared.

8.1 Condition Variations and Systems for Computer Simulation
8.1.1 Condition Variations to be Simulated
As with the description of the conditions and variations in Section 6.1 Methodology (p. 16), the conditions for the computer simulation are reiterated below and given descriptive codes. Each condition variation will have a code such as `cond_00-00_x_system'. Where `cond' describes the model as a condition, the first set of `00' is the condition number, the second set of `00' is the variation, the `x' it the seasonal variation where `s' is summer and `w' is winter, and `system' is the system name or model description. In Table 8-1 below, the model names for the computer simulation are provided and described. The following Section 8.1.2 below describes the systems for the computer simulation.

8.1.2 Systems for Computer Simulation
In order to simulate the 2D conductive heat flux through the roof structure and landscape walls, the conditions are broken up to define the following systems (see Figure 8.1 below): System 1 - Paving U-factor: Air (Exterior), Concrete Paving, Granular `A', Granular `O' (Clear Stone), Rigid Insulation, Concrete Slab, Air (Interior), and the left half of the planter wall System 2 - Planter U-factor: Air (Exterior), Planting Soil, Granular `O' (Clear Stone), Rigid Insulation, Concrete Slab, Air (Interior), and the right half of the planter wall Overall U-factor ­ Both System 1 and System 2 combined and averaged

37

Figure 8.1 ­ Systems for the Computer Simulation Models

Figure 8.1 above depicts the systems for the Objective 1 computer simulation as described. The walls are divided at the midpoint and each system is named based on the adjacent paving or planter fields. These systems will also be utilized for Objective 2 as applied to the example landscape plan. The results of Objective 1 CS are compiled and analysed in the next section.

8.2 Results of Computer Simulation
The figures in Section 8.2.1 below graphically depict the U-factor values for all of the CS models and variations listed by condition designation (also see Appendix C ­ Condition Simulation Model Results, p. 62). The figures in Section 8.2.2 and 8.2.3 are representative selected examples from the completed conditions with the 30 variations which are all depicted in Appendix D ­THERM Simulation Models Summer (p. 64) and Appendix E ­ THERM Simulation Models - Winter (p. 74). THERM provides numerical simulation output of the condition models as a U-factor value and percentage (%) error energy norm (EEN), which will be displayed in the charts. U-factor values were described in Section 2.2 above (p. 5). How EEN is derived is described by Mitchell et al. (2013) as "Upon the completion of the numerical simulation, the error estimator portion of the program makes local error estimates, and based on the error levels, refines troublesome regions of the model and recalculates the entire model. This procedure is repeated until no local regions show error levels higher than what is prescribed." EEN values are included in the charts below primarily for completeness purposes. Further to the CS models

depicting isotherms and flux vectors below, additional CS models are created to depict interesting iterations of heat flux magnitude in condition variations.

8.2.1 Results and Comparative Analysis of Computer Simulation
The results of the simulation have shown that the models with the lowest and highest U-factor values are generally what was expected when simply considering the design of the detail and the continuity of the insulation layer. As depicted in Figure 8.2, Figure 8.3, and Figure 8.4 below the lowest U-factor simulated, therefore the best performing thermally, was cond_02-04 and cond_03-04 at 0.1288 W/m2·K for summer and 0.1316 W/m2·K for winter. The highest U-factor model, or the worst performing, was cond_01-09 at 0.4937 W/m2·K for summer and 0.5078 W/m2·K for winter. The mid-range U-factor value was simulated in model cond_03-01 at 0.1815 W/m2·K for summer and 0.1874 W/m2·K for winter. Note, that the models listed here as best and worst performers do not include cond_XX-02 (lighter colour bars), the reinforcing section simulations, in the interpretation. If the reinforcing sections are considered, the worst U-factor performer is cond_01-02 at 0.7116 W/m2·K for summer and 0.7310 W/m2·K for winter. This highlights the localized effects of doweled in steel reinforcing located in a structural wall, the model cond_01-01 which is the same section without reinforcing, has a U-factor value of 0.4464 W/m2·K for summer and 0.4596 W/m2·K for winter. What this implies is that, based on the standard condition model in this study (cond_XX-01), reinforcing can increase the localized heat flux by ±37.0%, which is quite substantial.

39

Figure 8.2 ­ Condition 1 Results for Summer and Winter Simulation

In Figure 8.2 above, it is evident that the range of variations did have a relatively significant impact on the U-factor values for this condition. All of the variations, excluding cond_01-02 at reinforcing (lighter colour bars), are in the range of ±0.4 W/m2·K and ±0.5 W/m2·K, amounting to an approximately 20.0% Ufactor difference between variations. Generally as expected, these values are of a magnitude that was anticipated. Meaning, the condition variations where there is more insulation (cond_01-03 and cond_01-04) have the lower U-factor values and the variations where the wall width is varied (cond_0107, cond_01-08, and cond_01-09) have lower or higher U-factor values in relation to the decreased or increased width of the wall, when compared to cond_01-01. An interesting result can be found in cond_01-05 and cond_01-06, the variations with 25 mm wall insulation and no wall insulation. It was found that in these two variations the U-factor value increased slightly, showing that the wall insulation can serve an additional purpose other than thermal protection of the vegetation.

40

Figure 8.3 ­ Condition 2 Results for Summer and Winter Simulation

In Figure 8.3 above, it is evident that the range of variations did not have a significant impact on the Ufactor values for this condition. Most of the variations (excluding cond_02-02 at reinforcing), are in the range of ±0.175 W/m2·K and ±0.185 W/m2·K, amounting to an approximately 5.0% U-factor difference between variations. Furthermore, cond_03-03 and cond_03-04 with thickened slab insulation show the lowest U-factor values for this condition in the range of ±0.13 W/m2·K and ±0.15 W/m2·K. These results are somewhat similar to the range of values simulated in Condition 1, but with lower overall U-factors due to the thermal break provided under the planter walls. The initial idea behind the 150 mm thick rigid insulation thermal break was to increase the material thickness above the 100 mm slab insulation to help offset the additional heat flux that would be distributed through the doweled in reinforcing penetrations. From the results in the figure above, the 150 mm rigid insulation under the wall has helped to offset the overall heat flux in Condition 2 including the variations cond_02-05 to cond_02-10.

Figure 8.4 ­ Condition 3 Results for Summer and Winter Simulation

In Figure 8.4 above, as with Condition 2, the range of variations did not have a significant impact on the U-factor values for this condition. Excluding cond_02-02 at reinforcing as well as cond_03-03 and cond_03-04 with thickened slab insulation, most of the variations are similar in this condition and are in the range of ±0.180 W/m2·K and ±0.1875 W/m2·K, amounting to an approximately 4.0% U-factor difference between variations. These results are also quite similar to the range of values simulated in Condition 2, but with even less variation due to the continuous 100 mm thick slab insulation layer. In fact, when comparing the average U-factor values of Condition 2 and Condition 3 an interesting output was realized, Condition 3 is actually slightly worse performing than Condition 2. What this indicates is that in Condition 2 the uniform 150 mm thick rigid insulation under the CIP concrete walls actually helped to minimize or offset the thermal impact in other condition variations, thereby offering slightly better overall performance. Also for Condition 3, it was thought at the start of this research that there would be additional heat flux seen through the narrowed or widened wall variations (cond_03-07 to cond_03-09) due to surface contact with the insulating layer, but the difference in U-factor values in these variations was minimal as well. What actually occurred, was that the greatest U-factor differences in Condition 3 were due to the increased thickness of the slab insulation layer only.

Figure 8.5 ­ Conditions 1, 2, and 3 Combined Results for Summer and Winter Simulation

In Figure 8.5 above, all of the results of the condition variations are compiled into one graph (also see enlarged version in Appendix F, p. 84). This compiled graph simply depicts how all the conditions and variations away from the standard Condition 1 are significant improvements in thermal performance. As Lawton & Roppel (2014) outline, they describe the performance of `efficient' details as "Fully insulated with only small conductive bypasses" with a U-value of 0.2 W/m2·K, `improved' details as "Thermally broken and intermittent structural connections" with a U-value of 0.35 W/m2·K, and `regular' details as "Under-insulated and continuous structural connections" with a U-value of 0.5 W/m2·K. The range of U-values seen in the modeled Condition 2 and 3 fits into the `efficient' category based on their analysis, while Condition 1 would fit into the `regular' category. The next Sections 8.2.2 and 8.2.3 will depict graphically and summarise analytically the results of the more interesting or unique findings outlined in this section.

8.2.2 THERM Models ­ Summer
The figures below depict some of the summer condition variation models as captioned. For the model cond_01-01 (see Figure 8.6 and Figure 8.7), it can be seen in the isotherms and flux vectors graphics that the heat flux path is from exterior to interior and the majority of the heat flux is directly through the CIP concrete wall. In cond_02-01 (see Figure 8.8 and Figure 8.9) and cond_03-01 (see Figure 8.10 and Figure 8.11), the heat flux is reduced and more evenly distributed along the extents of the CS model, showing that improvements have been introduced. These graphics depict how the thermally broken wall helps to control and minimize heat flux through the slab structure.

In cond_02-01 (see Figure 8.14 and Figure 8.15) and cond_03-01 (see Figure 8.16 and Figure 8.17), the heat flux is reduced and more evenly distributed along the extents of the CS model. As with the summer conditions, these graphics depict how the thermally broken wall helps to control and minimize heat flux through the slab structure.

8.2.4 THERM Models ­ Additional Depictions
The figures in this section contain additional graphical depictions of variation models as captioned. Figure 8.18 and Figure 8.19 below depicts heat flux magnitude for the model cond_01-01 in summer and winter, the heat flux magnitude is focused at the uninsulated portion and through the CIP concrete wall. Figure 8.20 below depicts heat flux magnitude for the model cond_01-02 in winter, the heat flux magnitude is focused on the reinforcing steel with the highest conductivity value. Figure 8.21 below is an infrared representation of the temperature variation for the model cond_01-01 in winter, it depicts how the greatest temperature variation occurs at the broken insulation layer at the CIP concrete wall. Further to this, the temperature visualized at the top of concrete slab under the concrete wall is approximately 10 °C, while the temperature at the top of concrete slab under the rigid insulation is approximately 20 °C. Greater temperature variations seen over time when localized at the slab and wall junction area will place increased thermal stress on building elements including the CIP concrete, waterproofing layers, and insulation layers (Straube, 2012). Continuous thermal protection layers (as seen in Figure 8.22 and Figure 8.23 below, p. 48) help to reduce temperature variation across a building assembly and thereby increase the longevity of the materials, with an added benefit of minimizing internal localized hot or cold spots, which can cause condensation problems and/or negative affects to occupant comfort (Straube, 2012).

The next section, Objective 2 will apply the results of Objective 1 to the example amenity space plan to assess a variety of thermal performance conditions.

9 Objective 2: Thermal Analysis of Example Amenity Space
When the results of the on-slab CIP wall thermal analysis are applied to the example amenity space plan (see Figure 5.1 above on p. 15 and Figure 9.1 below) it is possible to attain an estimation of the overall quantifiable effects of landscape design choices. For the purpose of the example plan thermal analysis the worst performing, best performing, and mid-range performing U-factor wall conditions will be assessed in that order, to provide a broad range of examples, while not requiring the need to assess and compare all of the simulated wall condition variations. Figure 9.1 below, indicates the example landscape plan showing the thermal zones for analysis to be used in Objective 2 (O2). These thermal zones are derived from the Objective 1 (O1) calculations and systems, they have been measured on the amenity space plan and are listed as such; paving field (222.3 m2), wall at paving (79.6 m2), wall at planter (55.6 m2), and planter field (29.4 m2).

9.1 Example Amenity Space Variables and Equations
In order for the results in this section to be duplicated or applied to a different amenity space plan by an external reader, the variables and equations implemented to attain the Objective 2 results are summarized below.

Example Amenity Space Calculation Variables; A = Area U = U-factor value (simulated in Objective 1) q = Heat Flux Q = Heat Flow % = Heat Flow Percentage

49

Example Amenity Space Calculation; The heat flow values for the example amenity space will be calculated using the equations below: Heat Flux -> q = U · 1 · (Ti - To) Heat Flow -> Q = A / q Percentage -> % = (Qx / Qtotal) · 100 [W/m2] [W] [%]

The variables and equations defined in this section are then input into a spreadsheet program to simulate the thermal performance of the example amenity space using values from Objective 1. The results of these calculations are shown in Section 9.2 below.

9.2 Objective 2 Results
The total heat flow for the O2 cond_01-09 amenity space (worst performing) is 510.60 W for summer and 4926.71 W for winter (see Table 9-1 below). The negative value shown for the summer conditions in these calculations is due to the formulation of the heat flux equation and indicates that the heat flow direction is from exterior to interior (see p. 64, Appendix D for additional graphical examples). The total heat flow for O2 cond_02-04 (tied with cond_03-04 as noted previously) amenity space is 200.98 W for summer and 1925.15 W for winter (see Table 9-2 below). These results indicate that there is an improvement of approximately 60.5% between the worst (cond_01-09) and best (cond_02-04 and cond_03-04) performing conditions.

The total heat flow for O2 cond_03-01 amenity space (mid-range performing) is 341.43 W for summer and 3277.98 W for winter (see Table 9-3 below). These values place O2 cond_03-01_s results almost directly mid-range between cond_01-09_s and cond_02-04_s (cond_03-04_s) in regards to thermal performance. The winter results of O2 cond_03-01_w results are again almost directly mid-range between cond_01-09_w and cond_02-04_w (cond_03-04_w) in regards to thermal performance values.

There is relatively little surprise in the results of the O2 example plan thermal performance calculations. The results are in line with what was seen in the condition model variations in O1 (see Section 8 above, p. 36). However, if the example amenity space layout was modified or redesigned, more planter walls were added and an insulation penetrating wall detail such as cond_01-09 was utilized, there would be increasingly worse heat transfer resistance shown in the O2 results. This again highlights the importance of selecting a cond_03-XX (or cond_02-XX) model variation for the landscape walls during the design phase, which provides more flexibility in increasing the linear length of planters in a given amenity space without drastically affecting thermal performance. In the section below, additional temperature variations will be explored for Objective 2.

9.3 Objective 2 ­ Additional Temperature Variations
As outlined in Section 6.1 above (p. 16), additional temperature variations will be tested on the example amenity space in this section to simply assess the effects of solar radiation in the summer, night time cooling, or more extreme weather conditions in the winter. These additional static weather conditions will be applied to the best performing O1 condition variation model (cond_02-04, tied with cond_03-04) to further quantify thermal performance.

The additional temperature variations are outlined below; Summer; o o Winter; o o Interior condition; Twi = 23 °C Exterior condition; Two = -25 °C Interior condition; Tsi = 23 °C Exterior condition; Tso = 45 °C

9.3.1 Objective 2 ­ Additional Temperature Variation Results
The total heat flow for the more extreme version of O2 cond_02-04 (cond_03-04) amenity space is 1105.40 W for summer and 2431.76 W for winter (see Table 9-4 below) compared to the previous results of 200.98 W for summer and 1925.15 W for winter (see Section 9.2, Table 9-2 above, p. 51). The

52

heat flow rate for this additional temperature variation is increased for the summer condition by 82.0% and is also increased for the winter condition by 20.8%.

These additional results are quite different from the initial cond_02-04 O2 results above, they certainly indicate the effects of temperature variations and suggest the potential limitations of a static simulation. The results of the additional temperature variations included in this section indicate the importance of dynamic simulation to further improve the accuracy of thermal simulations and to help locate anomalies or spikes in the thermal performance data. However, this additional O2 result does not negate the simulated data that has been quantified in this paper, as the data is still relevant for comparative analysis and empirical examination within the outlined framework described in this study. Object 3 (O3) below will provide recommendations on how to utilize landscape wall design details to improve thermal performance.

10 Objective 3: Recommendations, Details that `Work', and Future Work
The results of Objective 1 and 2 are to form the basis of the wall design proposals to be outlined in this section, Objective 3. This section is where landscape design details that should be implemented will be proposed, and comments and recommendations (compiled advantages and disadvantages) for each

53

type assessed. It is also where details that perform thermally with the least heat flux will be shown, postulation of alternative details and recommendations, and additional materials will be discussed.

10.1 Recommendations and Details that `Work'
In this section it is important to build on some of the simulated results of this study and to recommend detail(s) that `work' both thermally and functionally. One of the motives behind the creation of this report was to raise awareness of provisions towards building thermal issues in landscape design. Other than the thermal considerations outlined in this report, amenity space landscape architects and landscape designers have to also be aware of program, function, economics, moisture/drainage problems, vegetation selection, sunlight exposure, and of course, aesthetics. Based on the thermal and technical research in this study, it is not recommended to utilize detail Condition 1.0 in landscape wall amenity space design. However in certain instances, a structural engineer or architect may not be willing to explore alternative wall designs based on site requirements, or due to a variety of other potential factors. If this is the case, it is up to the landscape designer, structural engineer, and architect to use all available knowledge to create a solution that satisfies all parties involved.

Figure 10.1 ­ Detail Drawing of Condition 2.0

To the author's knowledge, the proposed detail for Condition 2.0 (see Figure 10.1 above), or an iteration thereof, has yet to be installed in a constructed landscape project. Therefore, the validity of this condition as a working solution to landscape wall design is untested. However, in Lawton & Roppel (2014) they outline the use of the Schöck Isokorb® product in CIP concrete parapet design (see Appendix

54

G, p. 85), the design of which is relatively similar in both function and approach to the landscape wall design in this proposal. It is believed that the parapet application similar to Condition 2.0, with the exclusion of some specific landscape design functions still to be resolved (see Table 10-1 below), helps to validate the constructability and use of Condition 2.0 in a real-world application.

Figure 10.2 ­ Detail Drawing of Condition 3.0

Condition 3.0 is the `ultimate' landscape wall detail to be recommended for use considering thermal performance, longevity, and continuity of insulation, waterproofing, and protection board layers (see Table 10-2 below). Essentially, Condition 3.0 keeps high conductivity elements separated by low conductivity elements and maintains the integrity of the waterproofing layer, thus as a simplified hypothesis, it meets the requirements of a thermally/functionally performing landscape amenity space wall. Though Condition 2.0 and 3.0 were some of the best performing thermally, there are a few other design aspects to be considered or resolved when selecting a specific wall detail. For example, in both Condition 2.0 and Condition 3.0 the granular `O' clear stone drainage layer could be replaced or accentuated with a drainage mat, or drainage plate, placed above the rigid insulation or at the slab level above the waterproofing (Sutton, 2015). Utilizing a drainage mat in lieu of a granular layer would also help to reduce the structural capacity requirements for the CIP concrete slab, thereby possibly reducing the overall cost of the roof design. A compiled list of comments and recommendations for each proposed wall detail are described in Table 10-1 and Table 10-2 below.

Table 10-1 ­ Condition 2.0 Design Detail Summary; Comments and Recommendations
Design Details Condition 2.0 - Summary Item Comments/Recommendations Thermal performance Overall increased thermal performance but doweled reinforcing will cause reductions Waterproofing Insulation Drainage Constructability Cost Structural capacity Flexibility Minimal waterproofing penetrations, additional waterproofing layer can be extended up wall, waterproofing layer is not fully continuous Insulation under the wall can be thickened to balance thermal losses from reinforcing, doweled reinforcing creates thermal bridging Slab drainage should be sloped away from walls Due to doweled connections and reinforcing layer at the base of the wall, constructability will be more difficult Non-standard wall construction will have increased cost implications Doweled reinforcing will allow for increased wall heights, insulation structural capacity will require engineering input Wall condition is suitable for most designs and plan layouts

Cond. 3.0;

Note, these comments and recommendations are to be considered as a guideline in landscape amenity space wall design only. Landscape wall details, when designed to be constructed in a MURB or apartment building generally require consultation with the client, landscape architect or landscape designer, coordination with other disciplines (architecture, structural, electrical, and mechanical typically), and specific product selection (ex. rigid insulation, filter fabric, root barrier, drainage mat,

56

lighting, etc.). These provisions are relatively standard requirements in any design project and interdisciplinary coordination should always be thought of as critical to their success. Also to reiterate, as it was already mentioned in Section 6 (p. 16), for Condition 3.0 the layout of the wall in plan would require a shape with at least 3 to 4 sides to create lateral support as there is no doweled connection to the slab. Another way that landscape designers accomplish a design result similar to Condition 3.0 is to specify precast concrete planters, often in square, rectangular, or round shapes either with a bottom or no bottom. These precast concrete planters could be placed on top of the paving layer, granular layer or drainage mat, or on top of the rigid insulation layer. Depending on the size of the precast planters they can produced as one-piece units or multi-piece units that are assembled on-site to provide larger sizes and variation. Essentially, precast concrete planter walls could perform most of the same functions as Condition 3.0 but their main limitation is often size (ex. planting area and soil depth or planting soil volume) and flexural strength (particularly in multi-piece units). Either selection, Condition 3.0 or precast walls, is a valid choice for landscape design that could perform thermally and functionally. However each has specific aspects to be deliberated by the designer, some of which have been covered in this report in order to assess as many options as are relevant to this study. The next section will outline ideas for potential studies to expand and/or continue what was produced in this report.

10.2 Future Work
Though this study does not focus on wall materials other than CIP concrete, it should be noted that incorporating other structural wall materials as well as cladded walls into the simulation conditions would be a value added interpretation of varied landscape amenity space conditions. As with most design professionals, landscape architects and landscape designers enjoy a diverse selection of materials to work with to enhance their design and realise their intended aesthetic. However, because of the relative simplicity to build, commonality of material to structure, modern aesthetic, and overall longevity of CIP concrete, it is a valid material of focus for this study. Further to this, and based on the results of O2 and O3, it would be a useful exercise to study the impact of reinforcing in all of the O2 wall conditions as additional variations. The simulation results as defined in this research have shown relatively little deviation between the thermal performance of the O2 and O3 condition variations due to the rigid insulation layer(s). By including reinforcing as in cond_XX-02 in new condition variations, an idea of the effects of reinforcing on thermal performance in Condition 2 could be more accurately

57

assessed. Based on this analysis and the simulation results, it is also realized that simulating reinforcing would be useful exercise for Condition 1 variations as well.

Other wall materials could be included in further thermal analysis such as various types of natural stone (ex. granite, limestone, marble, etc.) or wood (ex. cedar, pine, ipe, wood composite, etc.). Additional wall thicknesses and wall heights could be studied, they are common factors to vary depending on aesthetics, function of the wall, or structural requirements (ex. aesthetic height of wall or soil depth for planting required). Temperature variations affect thermal conditions, it would be proposed to study other seasons and/or averaged weather patterns (ex. 12 per year with average temperature per month), or possibly dynamic weather simulated based on yearly measured data. Though Objective 2 simulates what amounts to a `representative 3D' condition by applying the 2D wall details to what would amount to an extruded 3D model, it would be an interesting study to actually simulate the thermal conditions in a 3D software program. Additional research completed on this topic should include moisture and condensation analysis, as it is important to the function of a building and to the overall health of the occupants. Internal and external temperature variations have the potential to create moisture and condensation problems at certain points within a building envelope, particularly at thermal bridges (Straube, 2012). To confirm or validate the results in the study it would be useful to test some, or all of the models and variations, in another simulation software such as HEAT2 (for 2D simulation comparison) or HEAT3 (for 3D simulation).

11 Conclusion
The results of the three objectives (O1, O2, and O3) in this report have shown that landscape wall details can prove effective in improving thermal performance of amenity space areas with intensive green roofs. O1 modeled thirty (30) condition variations with two (2) weather variations for each condition providing simulated U-factor values which were quantified in table format (see Section 8 above, p. 36 and Appendix C ­ Condition Simulation Model Results, p. 62 below). The results of O1 indicated that thermal design of landscape walls could improve thermal performance by approximately 55% when comparing cond_01-XX to cond_02-XX and cond_03-XX, though the percentage gained would vary somewhat depending on the specific condition variation that was compared. O2 analysed a selected three (3) of the condition variations, with a range of U-factor performance values (worst, best, and midrange), and applied the numbers to the landscape amenity plan in Figure 9.1 (see Section 9 above, p.
58

48). As described above, the results of O2 indicated that there was an improvement of approximately 60.5% between the worst (cond_01-09) and best (cond_02-04 and cond_03-04) performing conditions. In the section containing O3, based on the results from O1 and O2, two (2) wall variations were selected and proposed as recommended details to be utilized in landscape design which also perform thermally and functionally (see Section 10 above, p. 53). By quantifying the results of the condition variations, a tool has been created which provides a relatively simple method which can be adapted to model the thermal performance of a landscape amenity space roof design.

The above sections highlight how landscape designers and architectural designers need to be cognisant of thermal bridges within landscape areas over habitable space, particularly in exterior amenity space, and to learn how to avoid designs that proliferate thermal heat gain or heat loss. The results of this study also indicate that there is need for an overall change in landscape wall designs to be thermally broken whenever it is possible. In the increasingly interdisciplinary and interconnected field of building design, it should no longer be solely the purview of architects and architectural designers to be aware of thermal issues related to building envelopes. This is not to say that landscape designers must be architects or take responsibility for their work, but that they should gain enough knowledge to at least be able to critically assess building interface details and to posit informed questions when required.

Architectural designers and architects must also be aware of these issues and educate or inform others if there is a particular area of concern. More attention placed towards landscape wall design also helps to protect the overall integrity of the insulation layer and waterproofing membrane. Increased thermal performance of building envelopes is an ongoing and ever improving field of study, it is hopeful that this report will add some valuable information, and provide a useful voice highlighting the significance of thermal design in a field where is it often overlooked.
