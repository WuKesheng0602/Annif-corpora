   360-DEGREE  VIDEO  JOURNALISM:      AN  ANALYSIS  OF  THE  DIFFERENT  ANGLES  OF  MODERN   TECHNOLOGY  AND  NEWS  REPORTING      Master  of  Digital  Media  2017   Nitish  Kelvin  Bissonauth   Master  of  Digital  Media,  Ryerson  University  

      ABSTRACT     
This  paper  will  analyse  and  consider  360-degree  videos  in  the  context  of   previous  new  technologies  and  how  they  changed  processes  for  journalism.   Referencing  previous  research  literature,  news  articles,  case  studies  and  my   personal  experience  using  360-degree  videos  as  a  videojournalist,  this  paper  will   serve  as  a  conceptual  review  in  order  to  better  understand  new  considerations   that  might  have  to  be  taken  when  considering  360-degree  videos  for  daily  news   production.  Moreover,  this  paper  will  review  the  introduction  of  liveblogs  and   Facebook  Live,  and  how  each  has  fundamentally  changed  journalism.  By  doing   so,  this  conceptual  review  will  hope  to  identify  unique  challenges  and  successes   that  360-degree  video  journalism  might  have  for  the  reporter  from  a  technical,   ethical  and  storytelling  point  of  view.             

  

  

  

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  
"Success  is  a  journey,  not  a  destination.  The  doing  is  often  more  important  than  the   outcome"  ­  Athur  Ashe      On  this  particular  journey,  I  would  like  to  express  my  sincerest  gratitude  to  several   people.  First,  I'd  like  to  thank  my  professor,  supervisor  and  mentor  Gavin  Adamson  for   his  belief,  guidance  and  support  throughout  my  classes  during  my  undergraduate   degree,  and  now  during  this  major  research  project.  His  input  pointed  me  in  the  right   direction  and  allowed  me  to  make  the  necessary  changes  to  focus  and  hone  in  on  my   research.    Through  Gavin,  I  was  able  to  seek  clarity  and  a  knowledgeable  opinion.  For   that,  I  am  truly  grateful.  I  would  also  like  to  thank  Paul  Moore  for  being  an  insightful   secondary  reader  and  for  never  being  afraid  to  challenge  and  ask  questions.  Through   his  approach,  I  was  able  to  get  a  different  perspective  on  my  research  and  address   issues  that  were  overlooked.      Of  course,  they  were  not  the  only  one  involved  in  this  journey.  I  would  also  like  to   thank  my  former  producer,  Derek  Snider  and  the  team  at  The  Weather  Network.  Derek   Snider  was  instrumental  during  the  initial  stages  of  my  research  with  his  suggestions  and   feedback.  I  would  like  to  thank  him  and  The  Weather  Network  for  given  me  the   opportunity  to  experiment  with  360-degree  videos  in-house  for  my  research.  I  would  also   like  to  thank  Francis  D'Souza  and  Rogers  Media  for  their  peaked  interest  in  360-degree   video  journalism  and  for  giving  me  the  opportunity  to  work  and  continue  apply  my   research  as  a  reporter  with  CityNews.      Finally,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  faculty  and  my  cohort  from  the  MDM  program.   Throughout  the  year,  their  input  and  feedback  has  always  been  welcomed  and  very   much  appreciated.  Last,  I  would  like  to  thank  my  good  friend  Winona  So.  Without  her   support,  this  journey  would  have  been  very  lonely  and  difficult.  Thank  you  for  being  by   my  side  when  I  needed  you  the  most.

INTRODUCTION  
Journalism  serves  many  purposes  and  is  not  defined  by  technology,  nor   by  journalists  or  the  techniques  they  deploy.  Instead  its  purpose  is  defined  by  the   function  news  plays  in  the  lives  of  people  (Kovach  and  Rosential,  2014).   Technology  and  the  techniques  used  for  reporting  and  circulating  the  news  plays   a  continuing  major  role  in  how  journalism  is  presented  to  the  public.  This  is   evident  when  you  consider  the  introduction  of  new  tools  and  resources  such  as   liveblogs  and  Facebook  Live.  Technology  is  drastically  changing  and  so  are  the   journalistic  norms.  Having  said  that,  360-degree  cameras  are  next  in  line  to  bring   these  changes  when  it  comes  to  the  practice  of  journalism.    

  
  

  

  

  

  

  

A  Shift  in  News  Consumption  
We  are  currently  witnessing  a  shift  the  in  the  way  in  which  people  get  their   news,  as  indicated  by  the  research  described  in  this  paper.  It  is  important  to   understand  this  change  in  news  consumption  because  liveblogs,  Facebook  Live,   and  even  360-degree  videos  are  best  supported  on  smartphones  and  powered   by  social  media.    In  a  digital  age  where  nearly  everyone  has  a  smart  phone  and   access  to  the  Internet,  news  can  be  consumed  from  virtually  anywhere.  Users   can  get  access  to  the  latest  developments  as  they  happen  and  right  at  their   fingertips.        According  to  a  new  survey  by  the  Pew  Research  Centre,  62%  of  Americans   adults  get  their  news  on  social  media  (2016).  Leading  the  forefront  of  news   consumption  is  Facebook,  with  almost  two-thirds,  (66%)  who  use  this  social   networking  site  as  a  source  of  news.  Not  too  far  behind  the  pecking  order  is   Twitter  with  nearly  six-in-ten  Twitter  users  (59%)  who  get  news  on  the  site   (Gottfried  &  Shearer,  2016).  In  Canada,  almost  58%  of  users  under  the  age  of  35   use  Facebook  as  a  source  for  weekly  news,  followed  by  YouTube  (24%),  and   Twitter  (19%).  (Newman,  2016)              

  

  

  

   Moreover,  the  emergence  of  the  Internet  as  a  prominent  medium  for  news   consumption  has  also  provided  increased  opportunity  for  participatory  journalism.      Against  that  background,  I  propose  three  research  questions:   1.   What  kind  of  impact  do  these  tools  and  resources  have  on  a  mass   audience  in  modern  day  journalism?     2.   What  does  the  adoption  of  previous  tools  and  resources  (liveblogs   and  Facebook  Live)  contribute  to  the  discussion.   3.   How  can  previous  tools  help  identify  a  strategy  or  a  methodology   when  it  comes  to  using  360-degree  video  for  journalism?        This  paper  will  summarize  scholarly  articles  and  will  make  reference  to   case  studies  in  order  to  answer  these  questions.       

  

  

  

  

  

  

RESEARCH  OBJECTIVES  
   This  research  project  consists  of  identifying  challenges  in  order  to  better   understanding  360-degree  video  journalism.  This  research  project  integrates  findings   from  previous  new  technologies  and  techniques  such  as  liveblog  and  Facebook  Live  as   well  as  observations  from  experimenting  with  360-degree  videos.      This  applied  research  project  attempts  to  achieve  the  following:     

·   Research  and  thoroughly  understand  effective  practice  using  new  technologies  
for  journalism.  

·   Research,  outline,  and  define  some  of  the  best  practices  for  360-degree  video.   ·   Understand  audience  motivation,  including  why  this  content  would  be  viewed,  
liked,  and  shared  on  social  media.  

                                                                 

  

  

  

              

RESEARCH  METHODOLOGY  
   The  research  will  be  analysed  qualitatively  through  content  analysis.  Various   sources  will  be  used  including  articles,  case  studies,  research  papers,  academic  journal   and  personal  experience.  Conceptual  reviews  were  conducted  in  understanding  how   new  technology  and  techniques  have  conceptually  changed  journalism  over  time.  This   research  was  then  applied  to  produce  four  short,  360-degree  videos  for  news.  The   analysis  from  these  videos  were  done  to  highlight  and  troubleshoot  the  challenges  with   360-degree-videos.  In  addition  to  the  research,  I  add  my  own  insight  as  a  videojournalist.  

  

                                                     
  

  

  

  

  

What  are  360-Degree  Videos?  
   Not  to  be  confused  with  virtual  reality,  360-degree  video  is  as  its  title  suggests;  it's  a   form  of  video  capture  that  allows  the  user  to  look  in  all  the  directions  of  the  scene  that  is   being  recorded.  Instead  of  simply  looking  at  a  flat,  two-dimensional  image,  the  audience   can  now  experience  spherical  filmmaking  by  moving  a  device  like  a  smartphone  or  a   tablet  around.  This  method  of  video  capture  involves  stitching,  which  combines  the   edges  of  the  video  to  create  one  continuous  image.    While  is  can  be  viewed  with  goggles   or  a  headset,  it  is  not  the  same  thing  as  virtual  reality.  Instead,  360-degree  video  is  the   simplest  form  of  immersive  video  (2015).  Virtual  reality  on  the  other  hand,  is  a   completely  immersive  experience  that  is  computer  generated.  The  user  can  interact  and   move  around  within  their  surrounding  with  a  headset.  The  images  are  three-dimensional,   and  although  they  might  look  real,  what  the  user  sees  is  a  fictional,  virtual  world.        While  both  360-degree  video  and  Virtual  Reality  have  similar  properties,  it  is   important  to  keep  in  mind  that  360-degree  videos  capture  real  spaces  in  real  time.  This   paper  will  therefore  solely  focus  on  360-degree  videos  and  the  possibilities  this  new   technology  can  present  when  it  comes  to  storytelling  and  immersive  journalism.    

  

  

  

  

Liveblogging:  The  Online  Answer  to  24/7   Television  News  
   Liveblogging  was  among  the  first  journalism  tools  to  provide  live  breaking   news  online  so  potential  challenges  for  360-degree  videos  are  anticipated  in  that   medium.  In  the  early  years  of  the  Internet,  it  would  have  been  inconceivable  to   break  news  online  before  print  or  broadcast  (Thorsen,  2011).  Today,  it  is  a  much   different  story  with  news  breaking  online  first  and  more  often  on  social  media.   Liveblogs  have  been  variously  described  as  both  the  death  of  journalism  and  an   important  journalistic  development  (Wells,  2011).  Combining  the  curation  of   social  media  and  conventional  news  reporting,  liveblogs  allow  journalists  to  go   through  and  prioritise  information  from  secondary  sources  and  present  it  to  the   audience  in  real  time  (Thurman  and  Walters,  2012).  With  liveblogs  the  latest   information  is  provided  at  the  top,  in  a  reversed-chronological  order  and  that  too   in  increments.  This,  coupled  with  the  use  of  multimedia  content  and  sources  from   a  wide  variety  of  platforms  such  as  Facebook  and  Twitter,  makes  for  a  much   more  layered  and  complete  coverage.    

Compared  to  traditional  online  news  articles,  liveblogs  offer  an  edge  when  it   comes  to  transparency  and  immediacy;  allowing  reporters  to  post  developments   as  they  happen  including  live  editing  functions,  the  liveblog  audience  can  also   share  in  this  information  gathering,  sharing  and  verification,  thus  making  it  an     

  

  

  

engaging  platform.  The  Guardian.co.uk,  the  UK's  second  most  popular   newspaper  website  started  experimenting  with  liveblogs  in  1999,  starting  with   soccer  and  cricket  coverage.  It  wasn't  until  the  London  bombings  of  2005  that  we   saw  one  of  the  first  news  stories  to  be  covered  by  the  Guardian.co.uk  using  the   live  blog  format  (Thurman  and  Walters,  2012).          Since  then,  the  site  has  seen  some  great  success.  Live  blogs  now  have   minute-by-minute  coverage  with  the  site  accounting  for  3.6  million  unique  users   (Wells,  2011).  Studies  from  the  2013  Digital  News  Report  from  the  Reuters   Institute  for  the  Study  of  Journalism  also  suggest  that  liveblogs  also  have  a  much   better  retention  period  as  more  visitors  are  staying  for  longer  periods  of  time  than   conventional  articles  or  picture  galleries  on  the  same  subject  (2012).    The  same   study  also  took  a  look  at  the  popularity  of  liveblogs  in  other  countries  and   consumers  attitude  towards  live  pages.       

  

  

  

  

  
Figure  A,  source:  Consumer  Attitude  to  Live  Pages  (Digital  News  Report,  2016)  

   As  indicated  in  Figure  A,  40%  of  consumers  find  liveblogs  more  balanced,   with  only  27%  worried  about  the  accuracy  of  the  content  presented.     This  speaks  to  the  objectivity  in  which  Live  Blogs  present.  Since  it  involves   attribution  as  well  as  verification,  not  to  mention  relatively  transparent  signposting   of  source  material,  this  may  help  the  audience  better  judge  source  credibility   (2012).  To  a  certain  extent,  the  same  applies  with  360-degree  videos.  Readers   can  appreciate  a  neutral  tone  with  the  information  being  corrected  quickly  and     

  

  

  

the  balance  that  the  mix  of  sources  provided  (Thorsen,  2011),  Liveblogs  provide   the  reader  with  raw  material  laid  out  instead  of  forcing  a  narrative.  Alternatively,   the  story  tells  itself  with  the  information  presented.        The  raw,  unscripted,  loose  editorial  displayed  in  360-degree  videos  was   anticipated  by  liveblogs,  which  also  provided  for  video  uploading.  Since  360- degree  cameras  record  their  surrounding  space,  the  audience  can  now  see   everything  without  having  to  worry  about  missing  any  details.  Contrary  to   traditional,  linear  news  editing,  the  shots  are  not  organized  in  a  certain  way  to  tell   a  story.  What  were  once  multiple  versions  of  the  same  story,  as  a  result  of   different  accounts  and  camera  angles  is  now  uniform  and  standard  for  everyone   when  it  comes  to  360-degree  videos  (Van  Der  Haak,  Parks  &  Castells,  2017).   This  new  form  of  immersive  journalism  gives  the  viewer  a  first-person  experience   of  the  events  and  the  situation  described  in  news  stories  (de  la  Peña,  2010).     

  

  

  

  

  

Editorial  Challenges  Presented  by  New  Media    
While  liveblogs  provide  a  plethora  of  information,  which  in  return,  allows  for   better  transparency  and  objectivity  when  it  comes  to  reporting,  the  following  can   also  prove  to  be  drawback  according  to  some  critics.  Robert  Mackey,  a  writer  for   The  New  York  Times,  criticized  liveblogs  for  more  or  less  providing  readers  with   raw  material,  rather  than  telling  a  story  (Wells,  2011).  Others  have  condemned   liveblogs  for  having  no  structure  and  therefore,  no  sense.  Journalist  and  blogger,   John  Symes,  describes  the  platform  like  "being  in  the  middle  of  a  room  full  of   loud  with  people  yelling  all  at  once,  almost  like  a  media  circus"  (Thorsen,  2011).   With  the  sheer  amount  of  information  and  the  speed  in  which  it  is  being  curated,   the  reader  might  find  themselves  with  stories  that  don't  have  a  defined  timescale.   This  begs  the  following  question;  when  and  how  do  we  know  when  to  end  the   coverage?  (Wells,  2011)  One  example  that  comes  to  mind  is  the  coverage  of  the   Arab  Spring.  When  the  uprising  began,  liveblogs  provided  situational  awareness,   where  social  media  gave  a  better  sense  of  what  was  happening  on  the  ground   (Kiss,  2011).        While  the  liveblog  coverage  provided  some  groundbreaking  journalism,  the   duration  of  the  events  unfolding  and  the  sheer  amount  of  information  being   collected  for  the  coverage  presented  challenges.  Moreover,  with  liveblogs  it  is   easy  to  get  caught  up  in  the  rush  of  the  event.    There  is  no  time  to  make     

  

  

  

connections  and  analysis  since  all  the  information  is  coming  in  at  once  and  being   funnelled  to  the  top.  liveblogs  can  also  be  confusing  if  not  properly  structured  or   without  a  proper  end  to  the  reporting.        The  same  can  be  said  about  360-degree  videos.  Despite  giving  access  to  the   full  scope  of  the  scene  with  a  360-degree  angled  view,  this  feature  can  be  more   distracting  than  helpful.  This  is  especially  true  if  the  story  does  not  require  the   visuals  to  be  displayed  all  at  once.  As  with  liveblogs,  the  reporter  can  find   themselves  becoming  repetitive  or  redundant  because  of  the  images  behind   them.  No  matter  how  much  you  scroll  or  move  around,  you  will  always  end  up   back  to  where  you  started.  Not  only  can  this  be  limiting  for  the  reporter's  narrative   and  storytelling,  it  can  also  be  distracting  for  the  audience.  Liveblogs  also  face  an   information  overload  with  important  parts  of  the  story  buried  underneath  due  to   its  strict  reverse  chronology  of  entries  (Belam,  2011).        Similarly,  360-degree  videos  can  also  go  through  an  overload,  in  this  case,   with  the  wide  scope  of  images  displayed.  The  reporter  might  lose  the  audience's   attention  if  they  decided  to  scroll  or  move  away  to  a  different  part  of  the  scene.   Consequently,  they  could  miss  out  on  important  information  presented  by  the   reporter  or  not  pay  attention  altogether.  This  ultimately  affects  the  decision   making  of  the  reporter's  storytelling;  the  reporter  really  has  to  think  of  their     

  

  

  

narrative  in  order  to  make  sure  the  scenes  around  them  are  relevant  to  their   story.     Nonetheless,  both  new  technologies  offer  some  advantages  for  journalism.  .   When  liveblogging,  our  power  of  observation  are  doubled  and  tripled  because  we   now  see  things  and  look  for  things  that  we  would  not  otherwise  look  for  in  a  story   (Tenore,  2008).  The  same  goes  for  360-degree  videos,  where  the  reporter  might   look  at  a  situation  in  a  different  way  because  the  entire  scene  is  laid  out  for  the   audience  to  see.  The  reporter  might  want  to  incorporate  movement  and   interaction  in  their  reporting  by  inviting  the  audience  to  walk  around  with  him,   bringing  them  to  where  what  they  want  them  to  see.  This  not  only  captures  their   attention  but  also  invites  them  to  participate  by  witnessing  the  story  with  them  as   it  unfolds.       

  

  

  

  

  

Facebook  Live:  Redefining  Broadcast   Journalism  
   The  exposure  to  new  technology  and  mobile  devices  translate  to  a  greater   outreach  when  it  comes  to  viewing  and  sharing  content.  This  has  been  the  case   with  Facebook,  which  has  become  one  of,  if  not,  the  most  important  source  of   news  for  the  modern  day  consumers.  In  2016,  the  social  networking  site   introduced  its  Live  feature,  which  allows  anyone  to  broadcast  a  video  directly   from  their  smartphone,  a  central  component  of  its  growth  strategy.  (Moon  and   Volz,  2016)  As  a  result,  Facebook's  video  consumption  has  increased  by  75%  in   the  past  year,  reaching  8  billion  daily  video  views  (Kalogeropoulos,  Cherubini  &   Newman,  2016).        With  this  exposure  also  comes  the  opportunity  for  reporting  breaking  news   much  faster  than  live  television.  This  was  especially  true  during  events  such  as   the  attacks  on  Paris  and  Brussels,  where  Facebook  Live  allowed  people  to  see   what  was  going  on  as  it  happened  (2016).  This  speaks  to  the  world  of  immediacy   in  which  we  live  in;  people  don't  necessarily  have  the  time  to  wait  for  the  news  to   air  on  television.        With  the  immediacy  of  Facebook  Live  video,  arrives  more  challenges;  The   medium  can  raise  an  ethical  questions  that  reporters  and  users  need  to  answer     

  

  

  

for  themselves.  .  Since  the  feature  has  been  made  available,  there  have  been  at   least  57  incidents  of  violence  broadcast  via  live  video  in  the  past  year  (Lewis  and   Dahmen,  2017).  These  incidents  vary  from  beatings  to  rapes,  to  even  murder,   broadcasted  in  real  time  for  the  world  to  see.  One  of  the  most  notorious  incidents   is  the  death  of  Philando  Castile,  who  was  pulled  over  during  a  traffic  stop  and   fatality  shot  by  a  police  officer  in  Minnesota.  His  fiancée,  who  was  in  the  car  with   him  at  the  time,  captured  the  whole  ordeal  on  Facebook  Live.  The  images  were   graphic  and  disturbing,  but  nonetheless  stayed  online  to  garner  4  million  views   (Moon  and  Volz,  2016).  The  video  has  since  been  taken  down,  but  Facebook   Live  still  presents  a  unique  challenge;  since  the  broadcast  is  live,  how  do  you   predict  of  anticipate  and  incident  before  it  starts?      Traditional  television  was  able  to  work  around  this  dilemma  with  short  delays   or  even  cutaways  to  prevent  the  audience  from  seeing  graphic  or  disturbing   images.  In  addition,  broadcasters  are  subject  to  decency  standards  overseen  by   the  Canadian  Radio-Television  and  Telecommunications  Commission  and  the   Canadian  Broadcast  Standards  Council  (CBCS).  They  adhere  to  the  Canadian   Association  of  Broadcaster's  Code  of  Ethics  in  which  Broadcasters  shall  refer  to   the  CAB  Violence  Code  provisions  relating  to  the  scheduling  of  programming   containing  depictions  of  violence.  In  that  code,  it  explicitly  states  that   broadcasters  shall  not  telecast  programming  that  sanctions,  promotes  or     

  

  

  

glamorizes  any  kind  of  violence  ("Canadian  Association  of  Broadcasters  Violence   Code,"  1993).     Facebook  Live,  as  well  as  any  Internet  streaming  service,  imposes  no   editorial  standards.  There  are  currently  no  rules  or  regulations  regarding  the   content  streamed  online.    Although  a  spokesperson  for  the  social  media  giant   has  said  in  the  past  that  they  do  not  allow  people  to  celebrate  or  glorify  crimes  on   the  social  media  site,  Facebook's  standards  do  not  ban  torture  or  violence   outright  (Byers,  2017).        Consequently,  360-degree  video  also  faces  the  questions  raised  about  ethics   and  responsibility  on  social  media.  This  new  form  of  video  capture  is  supported   on  Facebook,  where  it  is  primarily  viewed  and  it  too  has  live  capabilities.  The   biggest  issue  for  360-degree  video  is  unintentionally  showing  harmful  images.   For  instance,  if  the  reporter  wants  to  draw  attention  to  what  is  going  on  behind   him,  the  viewer  still  has  the  ability  to  scroll  or  move  somewhere  else.  Under   these  circumstances,  the  reporter  not  only  loses  their  focus,  but  also  their   attention,  especially  if  something  is  happening  on  the  other  side  of  the  camera   that  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  story.       

  

  

  

  

  

The  New  World  of  Live  Video  
   Despite  the  concerns  surrounding  Facebook  Live  and  360-degree  videos,   both  are  redefining  broadcast  journalism.  Before  a  live  broadcast  was  a   complicated  operation;  a  crew  would  be  required  to  set  up  a  satellite  box  or  truck,   which  was  needed,  along  with  access  to  a  cell  tower  signal.  Now  it's  as  easy  as   opening  an  application.  You  are  no  longer  required  carry  as  many  personnel  or   equipment  and  it  take  nearly  half  the  time  to  set  up.        It's  also  noteworthy  to  mention  that  Facebook  Live  and  in  turn,  360-degree   video  work  well  because  they  have  an  inherent  realism  (Lewis  and  Dahmen,   2017).  The  audience  can  associate  better  with  these  videos  because  they  have   greater  authenticity.  Since  they  are  both  are  broadcasted  in  real  time,  what  you   see  is  what  you  get.  This  "liveliness"  provides  means  of  collective  witnessing,   which  cannot  be  experience  through  any  other  format  of  journalism  (Peters,   2009).    For  instance,  a  reporter  acts  as  a  witness  at  the  scene  of  a  crime  and   reports  live  on  location.  The  audience  is  more  inclined  to  believing  his  live   coverage  because  this  format  adds  to  the  reporter's  credibility;  the  audience  is   also  bearing  witness  to  what  he  is  seeing.       

  

  

  

  

Subsequently,  this  collective  witnessing  can  shed  light  on  certain  issues  and   spark  public  discussions  over  social  injustices.  The  Facebook  Live  shooting  of   Philando  Castile,  for  instance,  showed  the  compelling  and  challenging  aspects  of   bearing  witness  to  live  event  (2017).  The  video  not  only  exposed  the   wrongdoings  of  the  police  officer  but  also  added  to  the  discussion  of  police   brutality  in  America.        Finally,  Facebook  live  and  360-degree  videos  both  work  well  because  they   are  visually  stimulating  content.  More  often  than  not,  we  are  visually  oriented.   The  inclusion  of  visuals  increase  our  attention  as  visuals  are  easier  to  retain  and   remember  compared  to  words  (2017).  In  the  case  of  360-degree  videos,  the   audience  can  gain  a  sense  of  presence.  In  other  words,  it  is  an  immersive   experience  where  the  viewer  can  interact  with  an  environment  that  provides   continuous  stimuli  and  has  a  vivid  sense  that  they  are  actually  there  (Fonseca,   2016).  And  while  a  sense  of  presence  doesn't  alter  one's  perception  of  what  is   going  on,  it  can  have  an  effect  on  their  behaviour.  In  fact,  some  studies  conclude   that  consumers  with  higher  sense  of  presence  are  more  likely  to  be  persuaded   after  watching  infomercials  on  television  than  those  who  felt  less  presence   because  the  vividness  offers  the  viewer  such  a  realistic  experience  (2016).    

  

  

  

  

OUTCOMES  
   The  ways  in  which  we  tell  our  stories  are  changing.  Along  with  new  technologies   come  many  considerations  for  news  reporting,  360-degree  videos  can  present   challenges  from  a  technical,  ethical  and  storytelling  perspective  for  the  reporter.      After  identifying  and  analysing  similar  challenges  with  Facebook  Live  and   liveblogs,  I  decided  to  use  my  expertise  as  a  videojournalist  as  well  as  the  arguments   from  existing  literature  to  see  how  I  would  encounter  these  takeaways  while  using  360- degree  videos  first  hand.  I  decided  to  experiment  with  360-degree  cameras  and  produce   four  short  pieces  of  360-degree  video  journalism  in  order  to  better  understand  and  learn   how  to  properly  use  this  tool  in  order  to  create  a  new,  immersive  style  of  storytelling,  and   in  the  process,  provide  a  more  enriching  experience  for  the  audience.      After  experimenting  on  four  different  occasions,  I  can  confirm  that  360-degree   video  does  present  similar  challenges  to  Facebook  Live  and  liveblog  from  a  technical,   ethical  and  storytelling  perspective.  Here  is  how  these  factors  come  into  play.     

  

  

  

  

  

  

Technical  Difficulties  Introduced  by  360-Degree   Cameras     
Unlike  traditional  broadcast  cameras,  360-degree  cameras  are  small  and   compact.  They  are  much  easier  to  carry  around.  Writing  as  a  videojournalist  who  often   travels  and  works  alone,  this  feature  is  very  practical.  The  size,  however,  is  also  one  of   its  downfalls.  Because  of  the  shape  and  because  it's  so  small,  360-degree  cameras  do   not  have  any  settings  you  can  adjust  on  the  camera  itself.  It  also  doesn't  have  any   playback  or  external  audio  hook-up  capabilities.  There  are  some  of  the  360-degree   cameras  that  allow  you  to  view  the  image  by  connecting  to  and  using  your  smartphone   as  a  monitor.  However,  the  make  and  model  I  was  using  didn't  have  any  of  those   features.  That  being  said,  I  would  often  shoot  without  being  able  to  check  the  image  or   audio  quality  beforehand.  This  had  a  major  impact  on  my  story  about  urban  agriculture,   a  story  I  shot  on  Ryerson  University's  rooftop  garden.  Here  are  some  of  the  technical   challenges  I  encountered  while  shooting  for  that  story.       

  

  

  

  

  

  

Lighting  challenges  
With  360-degree  cameras,  you  can't  adjust  the  aperture.  You  cannot  control  the   amount  of  lighting  you  let  into  the  camera.  In  light  of  this,  it  is  imperative  to  be  mindful  of   the  positioning  of  the  sun.  Since  I  was  recording  on  an  open  rooftop,  this  was  a   challenge.  Unfortunately,  I  stood  with  the  sun  behind  my  back.        As  a  result,  the  video   was  underexposed   and  I  appeared  as  a   shadow.  I  had  no  way   of  catching  this   beforehand,  nor  could   I  go  back  and  review   the  shot  and  make  the   proper  adjustments.  I  only  noticed  the  lighting  issue  when  I  reviewed  the  footage  in  post- production.  What  I  should  have  done  is  reposition  my  interview  guest  and  myself.   Ideally,  I  would  want  to  record  when  the  sun  is  not  as  strong  and  bright.  One   recommendation  I  would  have  for  the  technology  is  for  manufacturers  to  develop  a   detachable  filter  for  different  colour  temperatures.  I  noticed  that  the  camera  I  was  using   had  a  protective  case.  Perhaps  they  could  find  a  way  to  develop  a  filter  that  would  be   easy  to  put  on,  without  ruining  the  image  capture  or  quality.  

  

  

  

  

  

  

Audio  Capture  
As  mentioned  before,  360-degree  cameras  do  not  have  an  external  audio   connection  for  a  microphone.  The  reporter  therefore  has  to  be  mindful  of  the  distance   between  them  and  the  device.  This  is  something  that  didn't  occur  to  me.  During  my   shoot  on  the  rooftop,  I  made  the  mistake  of  placing  my  interview  guest  and  myself  a  little   further  away  from  the  camera.  I  was  still  quite  surprised  and  impressed  by  the  audio   pickup  and  only  the  audio  wasn't  clear  when  I  had  my  back  turned  away  from  the   camera.  One  way  to   troubleshoot  this  is  to   have  a  secondary  audio   source  recording   simultaneously  with  the   360-degree  camera.   You  could  then   synchronize  the  audio   with  the  footage  in  post- production.  Of  course,  this  requires  a  bit  more  time  and  work  to  set  up.  Not  to  mention   the  challenge  of  properly  matching  the  audio  with  the  image  afterwards.

  

  

  

  

Mind  the  Stitch  
With  360-degree  footage,  you're  not  just  looking  a  flat,  two-dimensional  image.   Instead,  the  audience  experiences  spherical  filmmaking.  An  experience  that  allows  you   to  view  the  image  by  swiping  through  or  moving  devices  like  smartphones  or  tablets   around.  This  method  of  video  capture  involves  stitching  which  essentially  combines  the   edges  of  the  video  to  create  one  continuous  image.  That  being  said,  it  is  important  to   know  where  the  stitching  on  the  camera  is  located,  essentially  on  in  the  extremities  of   the  camera.      Unfortunately  I  wasn't  aware  of  this  and  as  a  result  my  interview  guest  and  I   ended  up  directly  on  the  stitch  for  a  good  portion  of  the  video.  In  order  to  avoid  being  cut   in  half  or  look  distorted,  it's  important  to  set  up  a  marker  and  be  mindful  of  where  you   stand.  This  speaks  to  space   awareness;  I  found  that   navigating  through  the  garden   was  harder  that  I  initially   anticipated  and  that  the   movement  didn't  come  off  as   organic  or  natural.  Not  to   mention  the  whole  concept  of   360-degree  video  capture  was  

  

  

  

  

new  to  my  interview  guest.  Having  to  explain  to  her  how  it  works  and  then  try  it  for  the   first  time  definitely  had  an  impact  on  the  interview  and  storytelling.      While  the  issues  presented  above  are  simply  technical  and  don't  necessarily   change  the  journalism,  they  are  integral  when  it  comes  to  presentation  and  audience   retention.  As  a  videojournalist,  I  can  say  that  the  production  quality  of  content  is  very   important  for  news  organisations.  The  slightest  issue  with  audio  or  visual  can  be   distracting  and  in  some  cases  off-putting  for  the  audience.  It's  for  that  reason  that   videojournalist  are  always  asked  to  not  only  be  meticulous  with  their  reporting,  but  also   with  their  shooting  as  it  is  just  as  important.        You  can  see  how  these  technical  difficulties  first  hand  here:

      Ethical  Dilemmas  Posed  with  360-Degree  Videos  
      Although  I  didn't  face  any  major  ethical  dilemmas,  as  anticipated  based  on   the  case  study  done  with  Facebook  Live,  one  issue  that  did  arise  was  the  non- consensual  capture  of  someone  on  camera.  My  video  about  stories  inside  a  tipi   is  a  prime  example.  Since  I  was  recording  in  between  storytelling  sessions,   people  were  allowed  wait  inside  the  tipi,  where  I  had  set  up.  A  gentleman   approached  me  after  my  interview  in  regards  to  the  camera  I  was  using.  After   explaining  what  a  360-degree  camera  is,  he  asked  if  there  was  a  possibility  to   edit  people  out  of  the  shot.  I  then  realized  that  because  of  the  parameters  and   the  restrictions  in  post-production,  one  can  easily  find  themselves  in  a  situation   where  they  record  someone  without  their  permission.  This  is  an  ethical  concern   because  it  can  violate  one's  right  to  privacy,  especially  if  the  person  isn't  part  of   the  story  or  in  this  case,  involuntarily  in  the  background.  Again,  because  360-

  

  

  

  

degree  cameras  capture  the  entire  space,  we  run  into  the  issue  of  capturing   images  that  are  not  wanted  or  needed.        You  can  see  my  ethical  dilemma  posed  with  360-degree  video  here:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3McK-G-SM-c    

      How  360-degree  videos  affects  the  narrative  and   thought  process  of  the  reporter     
              One  of  the  few  videos  that  did  work  from  a  technical  and  ethical  point  of  view  was   my  coverage  of  the  flooding  in  the  town  of  Minto,  Ontario.  This  event  had  all  the   ingredients  for  a  successful  experiment.  For  starters,  it  was  visually  appealing;  with  a   flood  zone  there's  a  lot  to  see  and  show.  As  a  result,  this  event  helped  me  realize  how   360-degree  video  can  affect  the  narrative  of  the  reporter,  not  to  mention  the  interaction   with  the  viewer  and  the  environment.  When  I  started  recording,  I  immediately  noticed   that  I  had  to  change  my  talking  points.  In  order  to  keep  my  viewers  attention,  I  now  had   to  acknowledge  or  incorporate  every  moving  action  around  me.  If  I  didn't,  there  would  be   a  good  chance  that  action  would  become  a  distraction  and  I  would  then  lose  the  viewer's   attention.  The  best  example  is  the  truck  that  drove  past  me  in  the  video.  Not  only  did  I   have  to  talk  about  how  it's  struggling  to  navigate  through  the  high  water  levels,  I  now  had   to  walk  in  the  direction  it  was  heading  in  since  the  viewer  would  most  likely  be  inclined  to   follow  it.    

  

  

  

  

   On  the  other  hand,  this  experiment  also  helped  me  realize  that  with  360-degree   video,  while  my  voice  may  not  be  the  focal  point  at  all  times,  I  could  become  a  curator  of   this  experience  by  inviting  the  viewer  to  draw  their  attention  to  certain  things  in  certain   directions.  With  the  360-degree  camera,  I  was  able  to  invite  the  audience  to  follow  me  as   I  directed  them  to  different  visuals  such  as  the  submerged  sidewalk  and  the  local   business  in  the  water,  thus  changing  the  conventional  narration  of  a  reporter.   Furthermore,  I  was  able  to  give  the  audience  a  better  idea  of  the  extent  of  the  damage   and  a  feel  for  what  it's  like  being  on  the  ground  by  looking  down  and  seeing  the  depth  of   the  water.  Since  the  viewer  is  not  limited  to  a  linear  viewpoint  or  a  horizontal  plane,  this   gives  a  better  first  person  perspective  of  the  scene,  making  this  a  truly  immersive   experience.  The  only  downside  was  that  because  there  was  so  much  action  going  on,  I   found  it  hard  to  properly  organize  my  narrative  from  start  to  finish  and  properly  wrap  up,   a  similar  problem  I  anticipated  when  analysing  liveblogs.        You  can  experience  the  flooding  in  Minto,  Ontario  and  see  my  coverage  with  the   links  below:

Conclusion  
   There's  no  denying  that  journalism  and  storytelling  still  play  a  vital  role  in  our   society  and  I  believe  it  will  continue  to  do  so  for  years  to  come.  However,  the   ways  in  which  we  tell  our  stories  are  changing.  With  more  people  consuming   their  news  in  the  form  of  videos  on  their  smartphones  and  mobile  devices,  it   comes  with  no  surprise  that  new  technologies  are  bringing  different   considerations  when  it  comes  to  news  reporting.  The  likes  of  liveblogs  and   Facebook  Live,  for  instance,  have  conceptually  changed  journalism  from  a   technical,  ethical  and  the  storytelling  point  of  view.  So  much  so  that  the  same   takeaways  can  give  us  a  better  insight  as  to  how  360-degree  videos  might  be   considered  for  daily  news  production.  It  is  imperative  that  journalists  and  news   organizations  understand  and  learn  how  to  properly  use  this  tool  in  order  to   continue  create  a  new,  immersive  style  of  storytelling.
