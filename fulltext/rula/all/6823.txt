EXPERIMENTAL STUDY ON SLIP RESISTANCE PERFORMANCE OF ASTM A1010 STAINLESS STEEL BOLTED CONNECTIONS

ABSTRACT
The primary aim of this experimental research was to provide information on the slip coefficient performance of ASTM A1010 stainless steel material and to ascertain if its behaviour is comparable to that of 350W Structural Steel. In accomplishing this task, it was important to examine other parameters associated with slip resistance testing, such as (i) bolt relaxation and (ii) the effect of temperature variation and re-usability of high strength bolts. In the 2014 edition of the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code, the slip coefficient for clean mill scale and hot dip galvanized surface condition for the 350W structural steel is specified as 0.35, whereas for blastedclean surface condition is specified as 0.5. Although test results in this research showed lower values for tested structural steel plates, the slip coefficient of A1010 stainless steel material performed better than the 350W structural steel for each surface condition and at the same temperature range. Recommendations regarding the slip resistance test method and the methodology for achieving the required surface conditions in slip resistance connection were drawn.

Chapter 1: INTRODUCTION
Background

Since the late 1960s, unpainted weathered steel has been used extensively in Ontario to construct bridges (whether as the entire superstructure or as support members such as beams). This was primarily done to reduce the maintenance requirement associated with the coating of structural steel members of bridges. However, weathering steel has not performed well in bridges where chloride from de-icing salt sprays onto the steel and prevent the development of a proper protective patina on the surface of weathering steel.

Research Objectives
The objective of this thesis is to provide a database of information that would assist in qualifying ASTM A1010 stainless steel as well as stainless steel bolts to be used in bridges for sustainable construction and retrofitting works. To achieve this objective, laboratory testing on actual-size specimens was conducted to: 1. Investigate the re-usability of high-strength bolt, high-strength galvanized bolts and stainless steel bolts; 2. Investigate the effect of temperature variation on bolt pretension; 3. Investigate the coefficients of slip resistance for bolted connections made of ASTM A1010 stainless steel plates at room temperature; 4. Investigate the stress relaxation of the most suitable grade of high-strength bolts and its effect on the slip resistance of connections; and 5. Investigate the effect of temperature variation on the coefficients of slip resistance for bolted connections made of ASTM A1010 stainless steel plates.

Research Overview
This thesis is broken down into 10 Chapters (with most Chapters being further divided into different subdivisions). The first Chapter includes the introduction, research objectives, thesis overview and research methodology. The second Chapter presents relevant information on ASTM A1010 stainless steel, its properties and structural suitability. The third Chapter reviews previous research done in the field of slip resistance, bolt relaxation, re-usability of high-strength bolts and temperature effect on bolt pre-load. Chapter 4 presents the experimental program done in this research. The results, analysis and discussions are presented in Chapters 5 through 9, while Chapter 10 presents the conclusion and recommendations for future research.

Research Methodology
This research is intended to provide information on qualifying ASTM A1010 stainless steel as a material that can be used in bridge construction and retrofitting. However, there presently exist very limited information on the short- and long-term structural performance of ASTM A1010 stainless steel. In addition, there is virtual silence in various codes on the use of ASTM A1010 steel.

In light of the above-mentioned facts, this research employed the following methodologies in order to accomplish the research objectives: i. Because limited information exists on tests similar to those to be done in this research, a comprehensive literature review was conducted on each of the five experiments required to be conducted in this research. However, this information would be obtained from tests conducted on carbon steel to correlate results with existing data and consider them as basis of confidence to conduct tests on A1010 steel plates and bolts. As such, a sensitivity study was first conducted to: a) provide similar and standardized testing procedure for A1010 steel research; and b) provide correlation with existing research data for carbon steel to gain confidence on the developed test setup in the structures laboratory. ii. Five different experimental programs were carried out to provide information on (1) highstrength bolt re-usability, (2) effect of temperature on bolt pre-load, (3) slip resistance testing at room temperature, (4) bolt stress relaxation, and (5) temperature effect on slip resistance testing. iii. The results from tests let to draw conclusions and recommendations for further research.

For the purpose of this research, the clamping force was induced into the bolted connection through the use of 22 mm diameter (7/8") A325 high-strength bolt and galvanized A325 high-strength bolt. The specific clamping force value was determined by using a Wilhelm Skidmore bolt tensioning device and applied to the plates through the use of a constructed template of the degrees turn that corresponds to this clamping force. Two different clamping force were used in this research namely: (i) the minimum clamping of 173 kN corresponding to 70% of the tensile capacity of the bolt according to Table 7 in the Canadian Standard for Limit State Design for Buildings, CSAS16-14 (CISC, 2014) and (ii) the clamping force corresponding to one-third of a turn according to the Specification for Structural Joints using ASTM A325 or A490 Bolts (RCSC, 2000).

ASTM A1010 AS A STRUCTURAL MATERIAL

Stainless steel is a family of iron-based alloys that must contain at least 10.5% chromium amongst other alloy. The presence of chromium creates an invisible surface film that resists oxidation and makes the material "passive" or corrosion resistant. Other elements, such as nickel or molybdenum are added to increase corrosion resistance, strength or heat resistance. According to Armao and Kotecki (2003) there are 5 categories of stainless steel, namely: 1. Austenitic Stainless steel: This material contains between 16 to 20% chromium and 8 to 24% nickel plus manganese. 2. Ferritic Stainless Steel: This material contains approximately 10.5 to 30% chromium and up to 20% carbon. 3. Martensitic Stainless Steel: This material contains between 11to18% chromium and up to 1.2% carbon, with manganese and nickel in small quantities. 4. Duplex Stainless Steel: This material solidifies as 100% Ferritic, however approximately one half of the Ferritic is transformed to austenitic stainless steel during the cooling phase. 5. Precipitation Hardening Stainless Steel: This material has 3 classes of precipitation hardened stainless, namely: (i) exist austenitic, (ii) martensitic and (iii) semi-austenitic stainless steel.

According to Fletcher et al. (2005), a new class of stainless steel for bridge construction was developed by Arcelor Mittal of Chicago, USA in the 1990s. This steel, designated and codified as ASTM A1010 stainless steel (also known in the industry as Duracorr), contains approximately 12% chromium steel and is highly resistant to atmospheric corrosion as shown in Figure 2-1. When examined, ASTM A1010 stainless steel contains a micro-structure, that is fine-grained in nature, of tempered martensitic and ferrite which allows this material to possess it desirable fabrication characteristics. The complete chemical composition of ASTM A1010 stainless steel is shown in Table 2-1(Fletcher et al. 2005). Also codified by ASTM A240 as UN S41003, this steel meets the same AASHTO properties of strength and impact as do regular 350W and HPS 50W steels, up to 100 mm (4") thick (see Tables 2-2 and 2-3 as well as Figures 2-2 through 2-4).

It is important to note that though classified as a member of the stainless steel family, ASTM A1010 stainless steel does not possess the same bright shiny appearance as other stainless steel materials of a higher chromium content. In fact, ASTM A1010 material, as milled scale surface condition, possesses a dull grey colour similar to that of 350W or 350AT steel and can be machined and bent in the same way (Fletcher et al., 2005). However, the primary difference between ASTM A1010 stainless steel and other traditional bridge construction steel is the manner/way in which it is cut. Whereas, traditional bridge steel can be cut using any conventional cutting process including oxy-fuel cutting, ASTM A1010 is more difficult to cut using oxy-fuel cutting or laser cutting. The primary/preferred means of cutting is (i) saw cutting, (ii) water-jet cutting or (iii) plasma cutting (Fletcher et al., 2005). In light of finding, ASTM A1010 stainless steel is more limited to on site fabrication or modification. Any fabrication or modification would require the services of a machine shop or plant.

Summary

LITERATURE REVIEW

The primary focus of this Chapter is to provide an overview of relevant research publications published on slip-critical joints, and present their findings that relate directly to this research. Although there are limited research publications on the behaviour of slip-resistance of stainless steel bolted joints or on its testing procedure, relevant information was found in related research that gives repeatable procedure on slip-resistance testing of other material that can be applied to our research. Based on literature review, a slip-critical joint is a joint that under tension, shear or moment produced by specified load (under service load condition), slip of the assembly does not occur over the life of the structure. The Research Council on Structural Connection guide (RCSC, 2009) states that slip-critical joint that transmits shear loads or shear loads in combination with tensile loads, in which the bolts have been pre-tensioned in the installed assembly (applying a prespecified clamping force on the faying surfaces) and with faying surfaces that have been prepared to provide a calculable resistance against slip.

Review of Literature
3.2.1 Previous Slip Resistance and Bolt Relaxation studies There have being many test programs that have been conducted to investigate the slip resistance of bolts connections. In order for these test results to be of any useful benefit, there are two important test parameter that need to, or must, be observed or maintained, namely: (i) the accurate representation of the plates faying surfaces and (ii) the method of measurement of the bolt pretension force (clamping force) used in the test setup. One of the latest studies on the slip resistance of slip critical joints was conducted by Annan and Chiza (2014). They performed experimental and analytical studies of the slip resistance of metalized and galvanized faying surfaces in steel bridge construction. Annan and Chiza (2014) concluded that metalized and galvanized faying surfaces are two of the most effective surface protection methods. Metalizing method refers to the thermal spraying on of molten zinc or aluminium alloy onto the metal surface, whereas hot dip galvanizing method refers to the complete immersion of the steel part, first in a solution of pickling acid flux and then in a bath of molten zinc. Annan and Chiza suggested that the faying surface condition of the steel part plays an integral role in the slip resistance coefficient for the slip-critical joint. As such, they recommend that the faying surface be cleaned with a solvent

8

to remove any oil or lubricant left over on the metal from the fabrication process. Annan and Chiza tested 25 short-duration slip critical specimens in both compression and tension. They also analysed the effect of the phenomenon of relaxation of the faying surfaces that are in the slip critical joint. From the results, they found that there was a loss of clamping force form the bolt, which indicated that there was a relaxation of the faying surfaces. This relaxation however varied for different surface conditions when compared to the pre-tensioned clamping force. The slip testing program conducted by Annan and Chiza (2014) included testing at two different clamping force, namely: (i) a clamping force that was equal to 70% of the bolt preload for a 7/8" diameter ASTM A325 bolt (that is approximately 174 kN) and (ii) a clamping force that was equal to 90% of the bolt preload for a 7/8" diameter ASTM A325 bolt (that is approximately 224 kN). From the results of these tests, they found that the average slip coefficient for faying surfaces, that were blast-cleaned with a surface profile of 2.6 and 4.5 mils and used a clamping force of 174 kN in the compression test, was 0.38 and 0.53, respectively. Whereas in the tension test under the same angular surface profile of 2.6 mils, the average slip coefficient was 0.36 for both clamp forces of 174 kN and 224 kN. They also found that tests conducted with the faying surface being metalized galvanized (that is two of mating surfaces were metalized and the other was hot dip galvanized) produced much larger slip resistance coefficient when compared to those found elsewhere (RCSC, 2009). Hechtman et al. (1955) conducted a research study on the slip resistance of joints under static loading. They tested joints that were double-lapped in nature and was subjected to compression, tension and torsional loads. They also seek to determine if (i) the difference in faying surface condition, (ii) the number of faying surface, (iii) the number of bolts in a joint and (iv) the tensioning of the bolts (bolt tension) had a direct impact on the slip behaviour of the joint. From their research, it was noticed that the primary test specimen used was of Class A surface condition (unpainted clean mill scale steel) as currently stated in the Canadian Highway Bridge Design code (CSA, 2014). In order to calculate the slip coefficient, they choose to use the slip load as that load at which major slip was first observed. They concluded that (i) the faying surface area, (ii) the plate-lap thickness and (iii) the bolt pattern had no direct impact on the slip behaviour of the joint.

Despite the limited number of previous experimental work and studies done on the slip resistance of slip critical joints, Nah and Kim (2011) conducted slip resistance testing on 5 different kinds of

9

faying surface treatment. The 5 kinds of faying surface conditions used were (i) clean mill, (ii) red lead painted surface, (iii) rusted surface, (iv) zinc rich painted surface, and (v) shot blast surface finish. They conducted their testing considering two main parameters, namely: (i) the faying surface treatment and its effect and (ii) the number of lap plates. As for the various surface treatments, Nah and Kim considered (i) clean mill surface condition left the same way it was delivered, (ii) exposing the steel elements outdoor for one month after the shot blast process was done to the metal to achieve a rusted condition and (iii) applying to the metal red lead paint with thickness of the application controlled at 65 µm as well as 125 µm, (iv) galvanizing plate surface in the form of painting. The metal surface was sprayed with a zinc primer and the thickness was controlled to 128 µm as well as 226 µm respectively, and (v) shot blasting with angular profile in the range of 0.5 mm to 1.4 mm. The clamping force used in this study was 178 kN. Research findings revealed that the slip coefficient for the specimen with clean mill scale faying surface condition was between the ranges of 0.23 to 0.29. For specimens with red lead painted surface condition, the average slip coefficient was 0.21 for the thickness of 65 µm. However, for the thickness of 125 µm the slip coefficient fell to 0.09. For zinc primer specimen, the average slip coefficient was in the order of 0.42. Nah and Kim also indicated that for the shot-blasted surface finish, the average surface finish was 0.5 mm with a standard deviation of 0.08.

Corbett and McGee (2014) conducted extensive experimentation and analysis to determine the slip efficiency and tension creep of different faying surface coating. They tested 5 replicated slip assembly and 9 tension creep assembly (a total of 15 plates and 9 plates, respectively). The clamping force for their procedure was obtained by a load cell, installed horizontally to the test plates. Corbett and McGee calculated the slip coefficients, and determined that the mean slip coefficient was very close to the value stated in the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code.

Nah et al. (2009) conducted experimental research to determine the clamping force of high strength bolts when subjected to different temperature range. Their objective of research was to develop from laboratory data and regression analysis an equation to estimate the clamping force of a specimen subjected to temperature variation between -10 0C to 50 0C using a hexagonal bolt. In addition, they tested two different method of clamping force application using hexagonal bolts subjected to (i) torque and (ii) tension. The bolt pre-load was considered to be satisfactory when a

10

standard force of 178 kN was achieved. To apply this clamping force to the specimen Nah et al. proposed using the turn-of-the-nut method, with the angle that corresponds to 178 kN varying from 1550 to 1710. This was higher than the standard turn-of-the-nut of 120º + 30º. They recommended that the turn-of-the-nut angle be revised to 120º + 30º which should meet a more accurate clamping force for bolts with high strength bolt of a diameter of 20 mm. Two types of bolts were used during testing, namely: (i) hexagonal bolt KS B1010 and (ii) torque shear bolt KS B2819. They were subjected to temperature variation of -10, 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 ºC. A total of 120 bolts were tested, half of which were KS B1010 bolt and the remaining half were KS B2819. Results showed that for high strength bolts subjected to temperature variation, the clamping force was vulnerable to temperature fluctuation.

Vasarhelyi and Chiang (1967) examined the coefficient of friction in joints of various steel. They investigated whether the number of faying surface has an effect on the jointed assembly. In their study, they made a deliberate attempt to differentiate between the true coefficient of friction (which was determined by testing the friction directly, through the application of a compression force to the test specimens) and nominal friction coefficient (which was determined by using a tension test joint). The difference existed between the interpretation/calculation of the two terms (i.e. coefficient of friction and coefficient of slip) was defined as the coefficient of friction was calculated as the load at which any one of the elements in the joint assembly moved (which is most often at the end of the joint assembly) while the coefficient of slip was calculated as the load at which large slip between the elements of the joint assembly occurs. From the results and discussion of this study, it was concluded that the friction coefficient was not affected by the number of faying surface. It was also concluded that even though with some joints the coefficient of slip was significantly higher than the coefficient of friction, there were many joint assemblies where the two coefficients were basically identical.

Grondin et al. (2007) conducted experimentations to measure the slip coefficient for Grade ASTM A588 steel. A total of 99 tension double-lap splice joint specimen were tested. The main test parameters that was examined were (i) the faying surface condition and its effect, (ii) the bolt pretension level, (iii) bolt hole diameter, (iv) the effect of the heating of the steel and (v) the fabrication of the bolt hole. The turn-of-the-nut method of pre-tensioning was used to clamp the

11

specimen by means of high strength bolt. They indicated that according to Kulak et al. (1987), a higher than average pre-tension force is achieved when using the turn-of-the-nut method and the pre-tension of the bolts reaches almost the tensile strength of the bolt. The Drilling holes in the specimens was done using two different processes, namely: drilled and punched, with the bolt size being 3/4" diameter A325 bolt. Similarly, the plate thicknesses were of two sizes, namely: 1/2" and 5/8" thick. They concluded that almost the entire test specimen showed a significant change (or increase) in the average slip coefficient when comparing the degreased plates and the as received plates. With the degreased plate specimens showing a much higher average slip coefficient. Surface preparation also had a very strong effect on the slip resistance value. Grondin et al. stated that when a comparison of the fabrication process used to drill the bolt hole, the result showed no significant difference in the average slip coefficient value when using the drilling or punching process.

Reuther et al. (2014) set out to evaluate the load loss behaviour of bolted steel assemblies using ASTM A325 high strength bolts under the influence of multiple variables as that experience under field condition. This experimental program looked at measuring the tension loads over a period of 42 days in bolted steel joint assemblies, made from 22 mm thick plates and 20 mm diameter ASTM A325 high strength bolts of lengths between 76 to 89 mm. In addition, two different bolted steel joint assemblies were considered in this study in order to determine the degree or level of relaxation within the bolt of the joint assemblies. Those are (i) assemblies employing direct tension indicators and (ii) assemblies that did not have any kind of load-indicating device. In order to determine the change in bolt length within the bolted assemblies, ultrasonic techniques were used. This ultrasonic measurement was then converted to load or stress through the manipulation of Hooke's law which states:
 

=

(3-1)

And after manipulation, it becomes

PA =

 

(3-2)

where: PA = applied load; E = modulus of elasticity; As = stressed area; and Le = effective length. Further to this equation they stated that the effective length includes the grip length of the bolt, Tg, plus a section of the bolt head and nut as follows. 12

Le = Tp + nTw + Td + 1/3 Dn +1/2 Dt = Tg +1/3 Dn + 1/2 Dt

(3-3)

where Tp = plate thickness; n = number of washers; Tw = washer thickness; Td = direct tension indicator (DTI) thickness; Dn = nominal bolt diameter; and Dt = threaded bolt diameter.

Reuther et al. also indicated that stressed area can be calculated as follows.

As =

( )+(  ) 

(3-4)

Where Lt = length of the threaded section in the effective length plus the provisional length for the nut; At = area of the threaded section; Lu = length of the unthreaded section in the effective length plus the provisional length for the bolt head; An = nominal area.

Fifty-four sample assemblies were tested using varying tensioning methods, bolt length and bolt diameter. From these testing it was observed that the loss or reduction in the bolt pretension occurred mainly within the first 72 hrs after tensioning and that stabilization was achieved thereafter.

Dewolf and Yang (2000) conducted research to investigate the relaxation of high-strength bolted connected using galvanized steel. Their testing program was developed to examine 3 key parameters, namely (i) the shear capacity of the bolt subjected to short-term duration testing, (ii) the level of bolt relaxation as a function of time as well as how this relaxation impact the shear capacity of the bolt and (iii) the slip resistance subjected to long-term loading. The variables for this research were as follows: (i) the plates faying surface condition (galvanized or un-galvanized), (ii) the nominal galvanized coating thickness (0, 5, 10, 15, 20 mils), (iii) bolt size (7/8"), (iv) bolt hole type and size (standard hole 15/16" diameter and over size hole of 1 1/8" diameter) , (v) clamping force (173.5 kN or 39 kips) and (vi) plate Thickness (25.4 mm thick). For each galvanized faying surface coating thickness and un-galvanized surface for the slip resistance testing, 3 samples were tested. Also, for the relaxation testing for each coating thickness, 3 samples were tested. Overall a total of 30 tests were conducted, of which half was of the standard bolt hole type and the reminder was of the oversize bolt hole type. Based on experimental findings, Dewolf and Yang concluded that for galvanized coatings with a maximum thickness of 5 mils both the

13

allowable stresses and the slip coefficient were within the acceptable range as stated in the AASHTO bridge specification. Also the size of the bolt hole showed no significant impact on the slip coefficient. However, they discovered that there was a loss in the clamping force over time, and this loss was due in part to the creep phenomenon in the faying surface with a thicker coating. As a result, this creep phenomenon created a significant reduction in the slip resistance of the bolted joint. As for the relaxation testing, a graph of clamping stress versus time was plotted as shown in Figure 3-1. In addition, Table 3-1 shows the relationship between the three tested specimens and the amount of relaxations.

Li and Yamada (1972) conducted stress relaxation experimentation on two types of austenitic stainless steel materials at room temperature, namely: Type 304 stainless steel and Type 316 stainless steel. Both stainless steel materials were subjected to heat treatment, with Type 304 stainless steel undergoing heat treatment at a temperature of 1100 ºC as well as 850 ºC for 30 minutes and then left to air cool. Type 316 stainless steel underwent heat treatment at a temperature of 1100 ºC for 30 minutes and then left in air to cool. The shape of the specimens used in this research was rod shape with a gage length of 50.8 mm and a section diameter of 2.54 mm. The research included the determination of the strain effect within these stainless steel materials. Therefore, both types of stainless steel were tested at 4 different strain levels. Li and Yamada found that the typical shape of the log stress vs log strain rate curve for type 304 stainless steel, that was heat treated to 1100 ºC, concaved upwards and was similar to metals that had a body centred cubic (bcc) crystalline structure. They also reported that this was quite a contrast to similar natured materials such as TD nickel that is basically a straight line. And those for a material with a face centred cubic (fcc) crystalline structure had a downward shaping log stress vs log strain rate curve. They further discovered that the shape of the log stress vs log strain rate curve for type 304 stainless steel that was heat treated to 850 ºC and type 316 stainless steel show similar results as that of type 304 that was heat treated to 1100 ºC.

Borello et al. (2010) performed research to examine the performance of bolted steel slip critical connections with filler plates. In structural steel design, filler plates are typically used with longspan truss connection systems, splicing of girders or columns. In orders for filler plates to be considered as fully-developed components, adequate amount of bolts or equivalent welds must be present to enable a uniform distribution of stress between the filler plate and the member being connected. Borello et al. tested 16 filler plated specimens consisting of a top wide flange column and a bottom wide flange column. ASTM F2280 "Twist -off" structural bolts were used to assembly two of the bolted specimens, with the rest of the bolted specimens being bolted with ASTM A490 High Strength Bolt, utilizing the turn-of-nut method to pretension them. In order to achieve maximum slip of the joint assembly (between the splice plate, filler plates and the columns), the condition of negative bearing was applied to the top column. A total of 24 bolts, 229 mm long, were used to connect the top column to the splice plate and a total of 64 bolts were used

15

to connect the bottom column. Test results showed that the slip resistance of the filler plate bolted connection was not affected by the oversize nature of the bolt hole.

Jhang et al. (2006) conducted experimentation where they investigated the effect of non-linear elasticity and the induced stress within a high strength bolt analysed using ultrasonic velocity. They stated that there are 4 methods of applying the initial clamping force and thus determining the bolt preload. Each of which has its own advantages and disadvantages as follows. Method 1 ­ Torque Wrench Method: It seeks to determine the clamping force by estimating torque applied to high-strength bolt. This method however contains significant errors, due mainly in part to the loss of friction during the conversion of torque energy to pre-load process. Method 2 ­ Angle Control Method: It considers the analysis of the linear relationship between the nut rotation and axial force. This region may be very difficult to determine during an experiment or on-site. Method 3 ­ Strain Gauges Method: This method examines induced stress within the bolt by measuring change in shear. However, the primary difficult with this method is that the attachment of strain gauges in on-site to the bolt head may be impractical. Method 4 ­ Ultrasonic Velocity Method: It is a more reliable method of directly determining the clamping force within the bolt through the use of ultrasonic velocity.

Jhang et al. (2006) conducted two different experiments to verify the accuracy of the clamping force by using the ultrasonic velocity method. The primary difference between the two experiments were the method of applying the bolt clamping force and the effect it had on the ultrasonic velocity passing through the bolt. The first experiment one used two M16/10.9T samples and using a tension tester to apply the clamping force. Whereas the second experiment used three M16/10.9T samples with a torque wrench being used to apply the clamping force. Results showed that for the stress-strain relationship in the first experiment, there was a very stable linear relation. As for the second experiment, results showed a decrease in the ultrasonic velocity with an increase in the torque value, up to an approximately value of 220 N.m. Jhang et al. further concluded that both sets of results were expected based on the theoretical tendencies and equations used in analysis, which seems to validate the effectiveness of using this technique.

Yura et al. (1981) performed both compression slip and tension slip tests in two parts. One part was done by the University of Texas where they tested two different surface conditions utilizing two different methods of clamping force application, namely: (i) clamping with 7/8" A325 high strength bolts and (ii) clamping with a hydraulic bolts and rod. Part two was done by the Federal Highway Administration where they used only hydraulic bolt and rod, with two surface conditions. Part one of their research testing contained both tension and compressive slip testing, whereas part two only contained compressive slip testing. They concluded that for the clean mill scale specimens that were clamped with 7/8" A325 high strength bolt , the slip coefficient ranged in values between 0.18 and 0.19. Whereas for the sand-blasted specimens of clamped with the 7/8" A325 high strength bolt, the slip coefficient ranged between 0.70 and 0.77.

3.2.2 Current Design Standards and Specifications The design and evaluation of slip-critical connections is governed by various codes and clauses. However, the CSA-S16-14 (CISC, 2014) and CSA-S6-14 (CSA, 2014) state that the design criteria of the slip-resistant joint should be such that under the forces and moments produced by specified loads, slip of the assembly shall not occur. In addition, the effect of factored loads shall not exceed the resistance of a bearing-type connection. The slip resistance, Vs, of bolts in a bolted joint is calculated as follows with constants shown in Table 3-2.:

Vs = 0.53.cs.ks.m.n.Ab. Fu

(3-5)

where: cs = value relates to the assigned specified initial tension (70% of Fu); ks = slip resistance coefficient (as obtained from experimental testing done in compliance with the Research Council on Structural Connection's testing method for the determination of Slip Coefficient for Coating used in Bolted Joints); m = number of shear planes (1 for single shear or 2 for double-shear); n = number of bolts; Ab = cross-sectional area of a bolt; and Fu = ultimate strength of the bolt material.

CSA-S16-13 also specifies that in case when long slotted holes are used in slip-critical connections, the value of Vs shall be taken as 0.75 of the values obtained from equation 3-5.

3.2.3 Bolts Pretension According to Specification for Structural Joint using ASTM A325 or A490 Bolts (RCSC, 2000), there are 4 different methods of determining the pretension of bolted connections using the bolt calibration method, namely: (I) Turn-of-the-nut pre-tensioning method; (ii) Calibrated wrench pretensioning method; (iii) Twist off type tension control bolt pre-tensioning method; and (iv) Direct tension indicator pre-tensioning method. This section presents a review of the turn-of-nut pretensioning method which was used in this research experimental program.

3.2.4 Snug Tightening of High Strength Bolts CISC (2014) states that the snug-tightening of high-strength bolted connection involves the alignment of the joint holes, followed by inserting of the high-strength bolt into the joint holes and tightening the assembly until all of the joint connection mating surfaces are in full contact with each other. In other words, the snug-tightened condition is the tightness that is attained with a few impacts of an impact wrench or the full effort of an ironworker using an ordinary spud wrench to bring the connected plies into firm contact. Once this has been done, the pre-tensioning procedural method can be applied.

3.2.5 Turn-of-the-Nut Pre-tensioning Method The Specification for Structural Joint using ASTM A325 or A490 Bolts indicates that the turn-ofthe-nut pre-tensioning method is a method that is both reliable and simple to conduct. It establishes

18

the relationship between the turn-of-the-nut relative to the bolt from the snug-tightened position to the amount of pre-tension in the bolt. The amount of turn-of-the-nut relative to the bolt is given in Table 3-3 , which represents a relationship between the bolt length and the diameter of the bolt.

EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM

Rationale of the Experimental Research Program
Based on the fact that there currently exist no literature or experimental data on the use of ASTM A1010 stainless steel, it was prudent to begin experimental investigation at the low end of testing specification. As such, all the testing parameters considered in this research were of the minimum specification, when compared to similar research such (Yang et al., 2000). In particular, these test parameters are (i) method of clamping force determination, (ii) level of surface roughness, (iii) method of surface treatment and (vi) method of application of clamping and the minimization of clamping force variation. Comparatively, based on review of similar research done in the literature, all conducted testing used parameters that were significantly higher than those used in this research. This approach was not adopted by this research, as it sought to determine the minimum benchmark specification that would produce acceptable design results of slip coefficient, utilizing common constructional practices in the steel industry today. In addition, another rationale behind the selected approach used in this research is that upon careful review of associated literature, many critical information or parameters were not reported on, which makes it difficult to ascertain (i) the true nature of their test results for fair comparison or evaluation, and (ii) completely duplicating their testing methods. Finally, the test results presented in this research are by no means the standards by which to assess or design ASTM A1010 stainless steel, instead it provides benchmark for future researchers to start further testing and experimentation on this material.

Experimental Program 1: Bolt reusability
Based on the research parameters used within this phase of experimental testing, it was divided into two major categories, namely: (i) bolt reusability testing with unlubricated bolt threading; and (ii) bolt reusability testing with lubricated bolt threading. In this research, an ultrasonic bolt elongation monitoring device, called Mini-Max, was used in this research to measure bolt tension through measuring change in bolt length before and after applying the pre-load.

4.2.1 Test Specimen Preparation In order to accommodate the attachment of the magnetic transducer of the Mini-Max ultrasonic bolt elongation monitoring device, all raised embossment on the head of the bolt, shown in Figure

20

4-1, had to be removed by grinding and the head of the bolt made flat and true as shown in Figure 4-2.

4.2.2 Verification of High Strength Bolt and Stainless Steel Bolt Reusability According to Kulak et al. (2001), the turn-of-the-nut method of pre-tensioning a bolt produces excess tension within the threaded portion of the bolt, causing the stress in this region to exceed its elastic limit. As such an examination of how many times a high-strength bolt can be subjected to repeated tightening and loosening before it becomes unusable needs to be conducted. In this

21

phase of the research program, tests were conducted to examine the behaviour of B8 class 1 stainless steel bolts, A325 high strength bolt and A325 high strength galvanized bolts. One bolt from each bolt group was used to determine the reusability characteristic of each bolt. Each bolt was placed in the Wilhelm Skidmore bolt tensioning machine as shown in Figure 4-3a and torqued to one-third of a turn, loosened and then re-torqued as shown in Figure 4-3b.

(a)

(b)

Figure 4-3: (a) View of Wilhelm Skidmore Bolt Tensioning machine and (b) view of degrees turn calibrated on front brushing of Skidmore Wilhelm Machine The torqueing was done at 10º increments up to 120º or one-third of a turn. They were then loosened at 40º increments back to 0º. The corresponding load and bolt elongation was record for each bolt type and analysed, Figure 4-4 show incremental torqueing and loosening data collection. The bolt incremental elongation was obtained by attaching a Mini-Max bolt elongation monitoring devise to the head of the bolt and the reading taken at each increment, as shown in Figure 4-5. Kulak et al. (2001) stated that galvanized high-strength bolts may differ in behaviour from A325 highstrength bolts. This behavioural difference is owed to the phenomenon of "galling". This phenomenon occurs when the zinc layer that surround the threads of the bolt becomes loose upon repeated torqueing and loosening action and causes the nut to seize. They recommended that lubrication could be applied to the threading of the galvanized bolts to reduce the effect of galling. Because the batch of A325 galvanized bolt test and the B8 class 1 bolt test used in this research did not contain any lubrication from the manufacturer, multi-purpose grease, as shown in Figure 4-6, was applied to the thread of these test bolt samples (see also Figure 4-7 and 4.8). The process

22

of incremental torqueing and loosening was then repeated on the bolts to compare the behaviour with that of bolt before lubrication.

Experimental Program 3: Bolt Pre Load Subjected to Temperature Variation Testing
The effect of temperature variation on the performance of high-strength bolt pre-load was investigated to examine whether there is an impact on the bolt pre-load for slip-critical joint. The research program in this phase included the testing of bolt, washer and nut assembly for the primary type of bolts being used in the research, namely: regular A325 high-strength bolt and galvanized A325 high strength bolts. Each bolt, washer and nut assembly was subjected to temperature level varying as follows: 20ºC, - 5ºC, - 10ºC, - 20ºC and - 30ºC, with each temperature range having five bolts tested. The varying temperature was achieved through the use of a Burnsco Environmental Chamber shown in Figure 4-9. The test procedure was executed as laid out in Table 4-1. Firstly, any raised indentation or markings on the head of the bolts were removed by grinding. After the indentation removal process, each bolt head was cleaned using acetone as shown in Figure 4-10 to assist in removing any residual metal filings left over from the grinding process. Next, a conditioner was used to clean any residual acetone from the surface of the bolt heads (see Figure 4-11a). Finally, before the attachment of the thermocouples to measure bolt actual temperature, a neutralizer was used to remove any traces of the conditioner from the bolt head (see Figure 4-11b). Type K-thermocouple wire was then attached to the head of each bolt as shown in Figure 4-12 using M-Bond glue, shown in Figure 4-13, before they were placed inside of the environmental chamber.

All 5 high-strength bolt, washer and nut assemblies from the A325 and galvanized A325 bolts were placed inside of the environmental chamber (a total of 10 assemblies were placed inside of the environmental chamber at the same time, as shown in Figure 4-14. The B8 class 1 stainless steel bolt was discontinued from use within this research from this point onward due to the failure of this bolt type during bolt reusability testing (i.e. not been able to develop the required minimum bolt tension using turn-of-the-nut method). The temperature in the environmental chamber was then set 3ºC below the prescribed temperature (with the exception of the 20ºC temperature range), so as to ensure that once a bolt assembly was taken out of the chamber, enough time was available to conduct the testing before the assembly's temperature raised above the designated temperature. All the bolt assembly for each bolt type was left inside the environmental chamber for a period of 24 hrs so as to acclimatize the assembly properly to the required temperature. Before the bolt, washer and nut assemblies were removed from the environmental chamber, their temperature were read using Extech TM300 Dual Type K/J Input Thermometer device. The bolt, washer and nut assembly was then removed one set at a time from the chamber and placed inside of the Skidmore

27

tensioning device, the transducer of the Mini-Max ultrasonic bolt elongation monitoring device was then attached to the head of the bolt as shown in Figure 4-15a. Next, the free end of the thermocouple wire was connected to a digital thermometer device to monitor the temperature. The initial bolt length was taken and recorded for future reference. The nut was then used to tension the bolt to 203 kN using an electric torque wrench as shown in Figure 4-15b. The elongation after tensioning was then recorded and analysed. This was done for all the bolts within each bolt group, at each varying temperature. The average result for each 5 bolt assemblies within each bolt type at each temperature range was determined and recorded.

Experimental Program 2: Slip Critical Testing at Room Temperature
Based on the objectives of this research, short-duration compression slip resistance tests were developed to analyse the slip coefficient of ASTM A1010 stainless steel and 350W structural steel. The faying surface condition of ASTM A1010 stainless steel was prepared in accordance to the Specification for Structural Joints for Class A (unpainted clean mill scale steel surface) and Class B (unpainted blasted clean steel surface) surface conditions. Whereas the faying surface condition for the 350W structural steel was prepared to Classes A and B as above in addition to Class C (hotdip galvanized and roughened surface). A total of 4 specimens were assembled for each set of surface condition for A1010 stainless steel, shown in Table 4-2, were tested for each surface treatment condition within the ASTM A1010 stainless steel group. They were tested at two different clamping force as shown in Table 4-2, namely (i) 173 kN, representing the 70% tensile capacity of the bold, and (ii) 203 kN representing the force resulting from the application of the Turn-of-the-Nut method. Similarly, for 350W structural steel, a total of 30 sets of assembled test specimens were tested, again using two different clamping forces shown in Table 4-2. The procedure laid out by the Specifications for Structural Joints using ASTM A325 and A490 bolts, similar slip-critical testing procedure found in literature, was adopted in this phase of research. However, some modification and additional operational techniques/procedures had to be developed and implemented to address the application of the clamping force, using the turn-ofthe-nut procedure for the pre-tensioning of the bolts.

4.4.1 Test specimen design The short duration compressive test of ASTM A1010 stainless steel specimen consisted of 3 identical plates of size 101.6 x 101.6 x 15.875 mm as shown in Figure 4-16. A 25.4 mm diameter hole was cut 38 mm from the top of the plate and 50.8 mm from the edge of the plate. Figure 4-17 shows the assembled slip coefficient test specimen. Based on the experimental restriction on the type of plate fabrication method (i.e. A1010 stainless steel plates cannot be flame- or heat-cut) and the difficulty with saw-cutting of this metal, the process of water jet cutting was used to fabricate the ASTM A1010 stainless steel parts as shown in Figure 4-18 and 4.19.

As for the 350W structural steel short-duration compressive slip-resistance test specimen, they were developed using the same geometry outlined in Figure 4-16. However, individual plates were saw-cut and the bolt hole was mechanically drilled. Specific attention was paid to the condition of the top and bottom surfaces of the plates (ensuring that they were flat, square and levelled) to reduce the effect of eccentric loading during the test phase. All burrs that was probably left and the plates from the fabrication process was removed by filing before surface treatment was done to them.

4.4.2 Surface treatment Once fabrication of test specimens was completed, the specimens were grouped and prepared for surface treatment. Class A surface condition for both ASTM A1010 stainless steel and 350W structural steel specimens were cleaned with a cleaning solvent (acetone). However, this was done immediately before application of the clamping force. The Specification from the Society for Protective Coating for White Metal Finish, SSPC SP5, (2014) was used to prepare the Class B surface finish shown in Table 4-3. The surface cleaning method utilized in this research was sandblasting process. This sandblasting procedure was done by Kings Mill Sandblasting Company. Once completed, all the blast-cleaned plates were cleaned with a solvent (acetone) before testing operation was conducted. The Brown and Sharpe Surfcom 112 stylus machine was used to determine the mean angular surface profile of the specimens, see Figure 4-20. As there was no set standard to which specimen surface roughness is required, this research used the maximum allowable surface roughness that could be obtained using the process of sand-blasting. This maximum value was also verified through sensitivity study conducted at two sand-blasting companies (namely: Vibra Ltd and King Mills Sandblasting company).

Before hot dip galvanization of the plates in Class C surface finish was done, the plates were grouped in set of threes and numbers were then stamped on the edges, as shown in Figure 4-21, for the purpose of identification and uniformity. The steel plates for Class C surface finish that was to be hot-dip galvanized was first submersed in a caustic cleaning solution (this is an alkaline solution used to remove dirt and other contaminants). They were then placed in a bath of pickling acid and then fluxed. They were then submersed into a hot dip kettle of molten zinc and allow to heat up to the temperature of the molten zinc to ensure that adequate chemical bonding occurs between the parts and the molten zinc. Once the plates have cooled, no further roughening of the metal surface was done. Quality assurance checks was done to ensure that the angular profile for each plate met the standard specification. The galvanized angular profile was found to be approximately 1.0 mils.

4.4.3 Snug-tightening condition determination Based on the nature of this research, with the modification in the testing method (relating specifically to how the initial clamping force is applied to the specimen), it is of vital importance to ensure that an efficient, accurate and repeatable method of verifying the clamping force applied to the plates by turn-of-the-nut method is developed and used. And that these turn-of-the-nut angles meet current specification. In order to determine the clamping force to be used, the snug-tightened position must be developed first. Based on the definition of snug-tightened condition stated in previous chapter, it is a condition that is achieved by making sure that all the faying surfaces are in full contact with each other, using a hand wrench to tighten the bolt and nut assembly to the point where it cannot be unwound by hand. Through careful review of literature and past work done, this point or position is very vague and there exist very little information (if any at all) as to the specific value (whether as degree turn or kN) of snug-tight condition. In addition, deciphering through literature it was discovered that using the hand wrench to tighten the bolt and nut assembly to the point where all the faying surface are in full contact with each other and the nut cannot be unwound, is dependent on two critical factors, namely: (i) the strength of the person applying the tightening force (which is very subjective), and (ii) the hardness of the material been clamped (which varies from material to material). In light of this finding and application in this research, in order to correlate the two clamping methods, the point of snug-tightened condition (in terms of degree turn) was established and verified for use as a datum point for these two clamping forces.

4.4.4 Verification testing of snug -tightening condition The determination of the snug-tightened position was done firstly through the use of the Wilhelm Skidmore bolt tensioning device. Five A325 high-strength bolts were tested using a hand wrench to tighten each bolt and nut assembly to the point where the nut cannot be unwound and taking the corresponding degree turn that correlates to that point. Also the Mini-Max ultrasonic bolt elongation monitoring device was used to measure the original bolt length before tightening and the elongation after tightening. Once this step was completed, the average degree turn value was determined and used as the snug-tightening position value for the purpose of this research.

34

4.4.5 Verification testing of clamping force According to the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code, the initial clamping force within the bolted slip critical joint should be 70% of the specified minimum tensile strength of the bolt. This value is 173 kN for A325 high strength bolt of 7/8" diameter. The Research Council on Structural Connections provides a detailed description of various minimum initial clamping force for ASTM A325 and ASTM 490 high strength bolts and the corresponding bolt diameters as shown in Table 4-4.

Table 4-4: Minimum bolt pretension (RCSC, 2000)

In this research, two clamping forces were used namely: (i) 173 kN (39 kips) and (ii) 1/3 of a turn (120º). However, in order to correlate this clamping force to degrees turn to correspond with the turn-of-the-nut method, 5 bolt and nut assemblies of each bolt type were tested using the Wilhelm Skidmore bolt tensioning device as shown in Table 4-5. For the clamping force at 173kN, five A325 high-strength bolt and nut specimens were inserted into the Wilhelm Skidmore bolt tensioning device and brought to the snug-tight position (based on the snug-tightened degree turn developed above), an electric torque wrench was then connected to the nut section of the assembly

35

and a mark placed on the socket of the wrench to coincide with the zero mark of the front plate of the Skidmore device as shown in Figure 4-22.

The assembly was then tensioned using the electric wrench until the Skidmore dial read the prescribed value of 173 kN (39 kips). The degree turns at which this was achieved was then recorded and reflected in within the results chapter of this research. The average of all 5 bolt and nut assemblies tested was then determined and the value used was the degree turn that correlates to the clamping force of 173 kN (39 kips). In order to determine the second of the two clamping 36

values which was used in this research, 5 A325 high-strength bolt and nut assemblies were tested with the Skidmore device as laid out in Table 4-6 below. However, with the turn-of-the-nut method (applying one third of a turn or 120º), the clamping force value that coincide with this degree turn was determined. The bolt and nut assembly was first brought to the pre-determined snug-tight position or degree turn inside of the Skidmore using a hand wrench. Once achieved, the electric torque wrench was connected to the nut portion of the bolted assembly and a mark made on the socket of the wrench to coincide with the zero mark on the front plate of the Skidmore (see Figure 4-23). The nut was then turned until 1/3 of a turn or 120º was achieved. The tension reading from the Skidmore for all 5 bolt and nut assemblies tested was then averaged and used as the corresponding clamping force for the one third of a turn.

The above two clamping methods described were then repeated for galvanized high-strength bolts to determine the degree turn for the galvanized bolt that correlates to 173 kN as well as the clamping force for the galvanized bolt that correlates to one third of a turn or 120º after snugtightening. Five galvanized A325 high-strength bolt was used for each clamping force determination. Once completed, these two clamping force values were used throughout this research and were applied to the various plate assemblies for slip-resistance testing.

4.4.6 Test specimen preparation and assembly From the clamping force verification process outlined above, 3 specially-fabricated turn angle templates were designed and cut out from hard plastic sheeting as shown in Figure 4-24 and Figure 4-25 and used to scribe the required pre-tensioned turn-of-the-nut angle onto the test specimen's outer plate.

4.4.7 Test specimen surface preparation The surface condition of various test plate assemblies per Table 4-7 was verified and completed before assembling of the specimens. Plates were arranged in groups based on the surface condition, then the final stage before testing surface treatment was applied to the relevant plates. Figure 4-26 Figure 4-27 depict the plates arranged for final surface treatment.

4.4.8 Test specimen assembly The degree turn stencil was used to scribe the degree turn on the respective front plate of the selected specimen assembly as shown in Figure 4-28. During the process of assembling, the three plates to form a specimen assembly, a 22 mm diameter A325 high strength bolt was inserted into the bolt hole of three plates as shown Figure 4-29. The centre plate was then rotated 180º and all the side check for alignment and the two outer plates checked to ensure that they were levelled as shown in Figure 4-30 and Figure 4-31. It is important to note that for the application of the 173 kN clamping force, two different degree turns was used to apply this force, depending on the bolt being used (see Figure 4-32 and Table 4-8 for more details). For the 1/3 turn or 120º clamping force, only one value of the degree turns (which was 170º) was used as shown in Table 4-9, (i.e. both types of high-strength bolts were tested at this degree turn).

Once the respective degree turn was scribed onto the various outer plate of each test specimen assembly for the 173 kN clamping force for the slip resistance testing, the completed assembly was then placed into a specially designed and fabricated gig as shown in Figure 4-33. The middle plate was then properly adjusted to ensure that the bottom of the centre hole was bearing or touching the bottom of the bolt within the assembly before hand-tightening was completed. Upon completing the hand-tightening process and electric toque wrench was placed over the nut of the bolt assembly and a mark scribed on the socket of the wrench to coincide with the zero position on the front plate, see Figure 4-34. The nut has then turned until the scribed mark on the wrench

socket matched up with the required degree turn on the front of the plate. Once completed, the tensioned assembly was then moved to the bolt relaxation process phase (see bolt relaxation testing phase) before conducting the slip test on the universal MTS machine.

44

machine shown in Figure 4-35(a) with the use of a portable load cell of 500 kN capacity shown in Figure 4-35(b). This was done in order to apply the initial settling load of 4.45 kN as stated by Yura and Frank (1985) to the specimen assembly. Special care and attention was paid to the mounting of the specimen assembly onto the MTS machine load plates so as to mitigate against eccentric loading of the plates. The general testing procedure used in this research was adopted from the Research Council on Structural Connections Specifications for Structural Joints using ASTM A325 and A490 bolts as well as from Yura and Frank (1985) for specimen clamping force detail. The compressive force was applied to the centre plate of the specimen assembly as shown in Figure 4-36, at a loading rate of 0.07 mm per minute until slip occurred. The force-displacement history for each test was monitored on an X-Y plotter as shown in Figure 4-37. Once a slip of 1.35 mm was achieved, the test was terminated and a new specimen assembly was placed in the MTS machine for testing.

Experimental Program 3: Bolt Relaxation Testing
The testing for bolt relaxation began by removing all the raised indentations/marking on the head of the bolts by grinding. Figure 4-38 shows views of the bolt head before and after grinding. A total of 24 high-strength bolts were tested in this research. These bolts were used in conjunction with the slip-critical testing plates used in experimental procedure in section 4.2. After the removal of the indentation from the head of the bolt, they were placed into the specimen assembly as 46

highlighted in experimental procedure 4.2. The pretension length of each bolt was then taken and recorded through the use on the Mini-Max ultrasonic bolt tension monitoring device. The completed assembly was then tensioned to the required degree turn. The immediate post-tensioned length of the bolt assembly was then taken and recorded again by using the Min-Max device. The tensioned specimen assembly was then put aside for a total period of 72 hrs. However, the lengths of the bolted assembly were checked and re-measured after 36 hrs and then after 72 hrs before slip-resistance testing was performed on the specimen assembly. The complete procedure outlined in this section was performed twice for this research, one time at a clamping force of 173 kN and a second time at a clamping force of 203 kN (see Table 4-10 for more details).

Experimental Program 5: Slip Coefficient for Specimens Subjected to Temperature Variation
Testing procedure used in this phase of research was based on the adopted from the RCSC Specifications for Structural Joints using ASTM A325 and A490 bolts for short-duration compressive slip-critical testing. However, some modifications and additions were considered to accommodate the effect of temperature variations as laid out in Table 4-11. Firstly, for the test temperature of each surface condition, the plates were prepared as mentioned in Section 4.2.6. The plates, bolts, washers and nuts for all 3 specimens were dry-fitted and placed inside of the Burnsco environmental chamber as shown in Figure 4-39 and the temperature gauge on the environmental chamber was set to 2ºC below the designated temperature. This was done so as to ensure that once each dry-fitted assembly was taken out of the chamber, enough time was available to perform bolt pre-tensioning to 203 kN the electric torque wrench before the specimen temperature increased to the extent it passes the designated temperature. The dry-fitted specimen assembly for each temperature range and for each surface condition was left inside the environmental chamber for a minimum period of 36 hours so as to allow the specimens to properly acclimatize to the required temperature. Once acclimatization was achieved, the pre-tensioning of the specimens was done. K-thermocouple wires along with an insulating foam pad covering the outer portion of the exposed thermocouple wire were then clamped to the side of the middle plate as shown in Figure 4-40.

The specimen was then placed back inside the environmental chamber to re-acclimatize the specimen back to the required temperature. They were left in environmental chamber for an additional 36 hours before testing. Upon re-acclimatization of the specimens, they were then taken out of the environmental chamber, one at a time, placed inside of an insulated cooler bag (containing frozen gel packs) and transported to the MTS Universal Testing machine, see Figure 4-41. This was done so as to mitigate against any significant loss/gain in temperature prior to commencement of slip testing. The specimen temperature was taken and recorded at the start slipresistance testing and every 2-minute interval throughout the duration of the test. Table 4-12 shows the test matrix for this phase of testing.

5 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION ON HIGH-STRENGTH BOLT RE-USABILITY
High Strength Bolt Reusability with Unlubricated Threading Results
Loading and unloading of the bolt samples to simulate the reuse of a bolt (i.e. tightening the nut and untightening the nut repeatedly) was done to ascertain the total number of times that the bolts could be reused before its strength or structural capacity is affected. According to previous studies done by Kulak et al. (2001), the turn-of-nut method of bolt tensioning will likely induce within the bolt a tension that will tend to exceeds the elastic limit of the bolt (threaded portion). Hence for high-strength bolts, repeated tightening of the nut is not recommended. In other words, the highstrength bolt should preferably be used only once. The following subsections examined this finding for the 3 bolt types considered in this research.

5.1.1 A325 High strength bolt with unlubricated threading Figure 5-1 depicts the change in bolt elongation with increase of bolt tension when the test is repeated more than 5 times for unlubricated A325 high strength bolt. It was observed that the bolt could be reused for a total of 4 times before the bolt strength is affected or the bolt-to-nut interaction becomes a problem for the bolted connection see.

5.1.2 Galvanized A325 high-strength bolt with unlubricated threading Figure 5-2 depicts the change in bolt elongation with increase of bolt tension when the test is repeated for the galvanized A325 high-strength bolt. It can be observed that when the threads are unlubricated, it can only be reused one time. This may be attributed to the galling effect of the galvanized material between the threads of the bolts and the nut. As a result, it causes the nut to jam or seize up on the threaded portion of the bolt upon reuse of the same bolt and nut configuration. Hence, it is recommended that the unlubricated galvanized bolts be used once in bolted joint connection.

5.1.3 B8 Class 1 Stainless steel bolt with unlubricated threading Figure 5-3 depicts the change in bolt elongation with increase of bolt tension when the test is repeated more than 5 times for the A193 B8 class 1 stainless steel bolt. Results show that the bolt can be re-used up to 4 times. However, it was noticeable that when using the turn-of-nut method of tensioning the bolt to one-third of a turn (i.e. 120º beyond the snug-tight condition), the load remained fairly constant while the elongation of the bolt continued. Galling action as reported by Kulak et al. (2001) was noticed after the fourth set of loading and unloading of the bolt and nut. Hence, further investigation was needed to ascertain if lubricating the threads of the galvanized A325 and A193 B8 class 1 stainless steel bolt would eliminate this problem and whether this lubrication would affect the strength of the bolt. In any case, results showed that the bolt could not continue carrying tensile load to 70% of its capacity. Rather, the maximum load carried by the bolt in each loading stage was in the range of 50 to 60 kN which gives an indication that this type of bolting can be used only for sung-tight conditions.

High Strength Bolt Reusability with Lubricated Threading Results
5.2.1 Galvanized A325 high strength bolt lubricated threading Figure 5-4 depicts the change in bolt elongation with increase of bolt tension when the test is repeated more than 5 times for lubricated A325 high-strength galvanized bolt. Upon application of lubricant to the bolt threads, one may notice an increase in the number of reusability cycles as well as an increase in the level of bolt tension value. The reusability capacity of the galvanized high strength bolt moved from 1 ½ cycles shown in Figure 5-2 to 5 cycles shown in Figure 5-4. However, though galvanized A325 high-strength bolts are usually delivered with some amount of lubrication on the threading (placed by manufacturer), it is recommended to conduct rotational capacity test (as per ASTM F3125/F3125M Standard) before installation of galvanized high strength bolt in slip-critical jointed connection.

5.2.2 B8 Class 1 Stainless steel bolt with lubricated threading Figure 5-5 depicts the change in bolt elongation with increase of bolt tension when the test is repeated more than 5 times for the lubricated B8 class 1 stainless steel bolt. Similar results were observed for lubricated bolt and those for the unlubricated bolt shown in Figure 5-3 (i.e. the total number of reuse increased from four times to five times without any galling effect occurring). Also there was a noticeably increase in the bolt tension value compared to the unlubricated bolt but not to the same magnitude as that for galvanized A325 high-strength bolt. It is important to note that the tensile force developed in the B8 class 1 stainless steel bolt (for both unlubricated and lubricate thread condition) was significantly smaller than that developed one in either the regular A325 or galvanized A325 high strength bolt. It is interesting to observe that t he manufacturer's tensile specification is developed from pulling tests, not from torqueing test.

6 Chapter 6: EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION ON BOLT PRE-LOAD SUBJECT TO TEMPERATURE VARIATION
A total of 5 bolt specimens were tested for each temperature range. Experimental data were recorded as the mean Wilhelm Skidmore reading, mean change in length and the mean initial length as shown in Table 6-1 and Figure 6-3 and 6-2 for A325 bolts. The mean calculated bolt preload was calculated using the bolt initial length and the change in length using equation 3-2. From the performance of simple linear regression analysis in Microsoft Excel, the link between the temperature and the bolt pre-load was established. It can be seen that for the A325 bolts, the change in Wilhelm Skidmore measured pre-load is very small (i.e. -0.015 as shown in Table 6-2), with a high p-value of 0.954, showing that the effect of pretension temperature is highly insignificant. This shows a negligible effect of adverse low temperatures on the measured bolt pre-load from the Wilhelm Skidmore bolt tensioning device. This can also be seen visually from Figure 6-1, where the trend-line between the data points does not seem to show a positive or a negative change, rather it stays pretty much straight throughout. On the other hand, using the calculated bolt pre-load based on the elongation of the bolts under adversely low temperature conditions alone, it can be seen from Figure 6-2 that there is a clear link between the temperature and the calculated bolt preload values. However, since the calculated bolt pre-load is based solely on the elongation of the bolt and it may not truly represent the bolt strength which also depends on other bolt characteristics such as bolt manufacturing defect, rate of cooling between bolt of the same production batch, etc.

As for galvanized A325 bolts, a total of 5 bolt specimens were tested for each temperature range. From performing the simple excel regression analysis in Microsoft Excel, the link between the temperature and the bolts pre-load was established. Tables 6-3 and 6-4 as well as Figures 6-3 and 6-3. It can be observed that for the galvanized A325 bolts, the change in bolt tension measured using Wilhelm Skidmore device with change in pre-load temperature is adversely linear, (i.e.1.01745 with a p-value of 0.13969 as shown in Table 6-4). This can be visually observed in Figure 6-3, where the trend line between the data points seems to show a negative change with the decrease in temperature. Using the calculated bolt preload based on the elongation of the bolts under adversely low temperature, it also can be observed from Figure 6-4 that there is a clear and more pronounced link between the adverse temperature and the calculated bolt pre-load values.

One sample of each set of slip-resistance test results is presented herein. However, complete set of data in graphical and tabulated forms are presented in Appendices A through D for each bolt group and surface condition.

Surface Roughness Results
For a surface, the roughness is most often measured by using a form/type of Brown and Sharpe Surfcom 112B stylus instrument, with the measured results generally quoted as the mathematical average value, in other words the average roughness value (Ra), which is generally stated/expressed in micrometres (m). In this research, the process of sand-blasting was employed to obtain the desired surface condition of blasted clean. The maximum sand grit size that was used to produce this surface roughness was black shot 12 (grit size 12). Table 7-1 shows a breakdown of the mean values of roughness obtained from the sandblasting process.

Determination of Clamping Force Results for A325 Bolts
Based on the nature of this research and the changes made in the testing procedure when compared to those found in similar research such as Fisher et al. (1974), the degree turn corresponding to the minimum clamping force of 173 kN had to be determined as presented in in Table 7-2 Table 7-3.

61

A total of ten A325 high-strength bolts were tension inside the Wilhelm Skidmore bolt tensioning device from two different positions, namely: (i) hand-tightened position and (ii) snug-tightened position. From the hand-tightened position, the degree turns required to obtain a clamping force/bolt tension of 173 kN ranged from 130º to 170º with an average value of 152º turns as depicted in Table 7-2. From the snug-tightened position of 50º turns, the degree turns required to acquire a bolt tension of 173 kN ranged from 90º to 110ºwith an average value of 101º. Thus, for the A325 high-strength bolt, a degree turn of 152º from the hand-tightened position was used to apply pretension to the plates in each specimen. Five A325 bolts were used to determine the clamping force that correlates to the third of a turn or 120 º turn from the snug-tightened position. A breakdown of the 5 tests is provided in Table 7-4, as it shows the clamping force for 120º turn ranging in value from 197 kN to 206 kN with an average clamping force of 203 kN.

For the A325 Galvanized high-strength bolt, another degrees turn was determined due to the fact that this bolt had a galvanized coating on the threading which tends to offer resistance to the application of a clamping force. Table 7-5 presents the results of the 5 bolt samples tested to determine the degrees turn for A325 galvanized bolt. An average degrees turn of 110 º from the snug-tightened position was observed. Results from 5 galvanized bolt samples tested at 120º turn were presented in Table 7-6and show an average clamping force of 187 kN when using this galvanized bolt. This showed that when using regular A325 high-strength bolt and galvanized A325 high-strength bolt, two different clamping forces have to be used to determine the slipcoefficient, both at the minimum clamping force of 173 kN and at one third of a turn (120º).

Slip Resistance Coefficient at 173 kN Clamping Force
For this phase of the testing program, 3 identical specimens were tested for each surface condition, and in some cases, 4 identical specimens were used, bringing the total number of specimens tested to 26 for each of the two clamping forces used. Each tested specimen was allowed to relax after the application of the clamping force for a period of 72 hours. During this time, bolt relaxation was monitored through recording the change in length over time (discussed further in Chapter 6). According to Yang et al. (2000), the design of slip-critical high-strength bolted connections to transfer service shear loads through the process of friction is developed between the contact surfaces of the joint plate material through the action of the clamping bolts. In similar research conducted by Yura et al. (1981), the slip resistance coefficient for an individual test specimen is calculated from the equation below: Slip Resistance Coefficient (Ks )

(7- 1)

Yura et al. (1981) used 3 different types of curves as shown in Figure 7-1 to evaluate the slip load behaviour of a high strength friction-type bolted connection subjected to slip. Three types of curves are usually observed and the slip load associated with each type is defined as follows: Curve (a): slip load is the maximum load, provided it occurs before a slip of 0.5 mm (0.02 inch) is recorded; Curve (b): slip load is the load at which the slip rate increases suddenly; and Curve (c): slip load is the load corresponding to a deformation of 0.5 mm (0.02 inch).

Figure 7-1: Slip-load definition curves (Yura et al. 1981)

By referencing these curves throughout this research, the slip load was determined at a displacement of 0.5 mm (0.02 inch) irrespective of the graph shape. The primary objective of this research was to assess the behaviour of A1010 stainless steel under slip-critical testing and to determine the slip coefficient for the material at room temperature, with different surface treatments and then compare the results with similar testing done on 350W structural steel material of similar surface treatment. The primary technique of applying the clamping force to the test specimens was the turn-of-the-nut method. As such two different clamping forces were used throughout this research (173 kN and 203 kN). With the 173 kN being the minimum clamping force as recommended elsewhere (RCSC, 2000; Yura et al., 1981). The clamping force of 203 kN related to the derived clamping force was determined by this research using the turn-of-the-nut method for A325 high-strength bolt and the Wilhelm Skidmore bolt tensioning device.

A sample graph of the results for the various material and surface treatment for the two clamping forces are shown below in Figure 7-2 through Figure 7-7 (with the rest of the test result graphs shown in appendix C) for the 173 kN clamping force and Figure 7-8 through Figure 7-13 (with

65

rest of the test result graphs shown in appendix D) for 203 kN clamping force. A summary of the mean slip load and slip coefficient (as calculated from equation 7-1) is presented in the accompanying tables, Table 7-7 through Table 7-12 for the 173 kN clamping force and Table 7-13 through Table 7-18 for the 203 kN, for the various material surface treatment. From analysis of the slip critical testing at 173 kN clamping force, the mean slip load and slip coefficient for the 350W structural steel with (a) clean mill scale, (b) blasted clean, and (c) hot-dip galvanized show a mean slip load ranging from 53.44 kN for clean mill scale surface condition to 79.8 kN for blasted-clean surface condition and mean slip coefficient ranging between 0.152 for clean mill scale surface condition to 0.196 for blast-cleaned surface condition. For A1010 stainless steel slip critical testing, results show that A1010 steel has a similar slip resistance performance at the clamping force of 173 kN when compared to the 350W structural steel material, with mean slip loads ranging from 58.8 kN for clean mill scale surface condition to 78.2 kN for blasted clean surface condition. In the present research, these results are close in value to similar research findings found in the literature (Fisher et al. 2000; Yura et al., 1981 and Yang et al., 2000). Yang et al. reported mean slip coefficient for standard size hole ranging from 0.34 to 0.53 at a clamping from of 173.5 kN. By mere surface examination, the results of slip coefficient reached in the current research would seem to be low, however, it was not clear whether Yang et al. tested the specimens immediately after the application of the clamping force or after relaxation of the specimens occurred. Also they utilize the most accurate method of obtaining and minimizing variation in the clamping force, which is strain gauge bolts. Other research conducted by Yura et al. (1981) reported mean slip coefficient (for similar specimen set up and test method), ranging from 0.18 to 0.19 for clean mill scale surface condition and from 0.75 mm to 0.77 mm for blast-clean surface condition. In light of their results, the result obtained in the current research for 350W structural steel and A1010 stainless steel clean mill scale surface condition in on par with their study. However, for the blastcleaned surface condition for both 350W structural steel and A1010 stainless steel, the slip coefficient was lower than those obtained in their study. This research concludes that the low values for slip coefficient could be due in part to the slight variation in the testing approaches utilized between the two researches. In that, the research conducted by Yura et al. in 1981 did not report measurement values for their surface roughness condition as well as the fact that their specimens where left exposed to the environment. However the specimens in the current research

66

were tested shortly after blast-cleaning was done. This could be a contributing factor for the difference in mean slip coefficient. Also, Yura et al. did not indicate the time period between application of the clamping force and start of testing of the specimen. According to research by others (Fisher et al., 2000; Yang et al. 2000), this will have a direct impact on the level of slip load recorded and in turn the slip coefficient calculated. When the turn-of-nut bolt pre-tensioning method was used to apply the clamping force in this research, it showed that the mean slip load for different surface conditions ranged from 63.276 kN for a clean mill scale surface to 82.1 kN for blast-cleaned surface condition. Once again these results were on the lower side of slip coefficient when compared to those in similar research. However, this research conclude that the various factors outlined above also had an impact on the values received. Similarly, when A1010 stainless steel results were compared to 350W structural steel results, they showed slightly improved slip resistance performance, with values for mean slip load ranging from 77.5 kN for blast-cleaned surface to 60.5 kN for clean mill scale. It was noticed that in this research for the A1010 stainless steel material for both clamping force used, the mean slip load and slip coefficient for the clean mill scale surface condition was lower than those of blast-clean surface condition, which is a similar result pattern obtained for the 350W structural steel (for both clamping force).

Observations of slip test result and comparison with similar research
Results showed that slip coefficients obtained in this research were always lower than those in the Canadian codes and Standards (CISC, 2014; CSA, 2014) as well as in other literature. Upon careful examination of this comparison, the following observations were drawn: 1- Testing for the determination of slip coefficient in this research was done using actual conditions practiced within the steel industry. The bolt was first pre-tensioned to the target value, then the bolt-plate assembly was left 72 hrs before conducting the slip-resistance test. Then, the test was conducted with the actual clamping force in the bolt during the test that included effect of bolt relaxation. However, the ASTM test method and the research conducted to reach the slip coefficient values specified in the CHBDC mandated maintaining the clamping force through testing with a hydraulic jack and a load cell. This condition of maintaining clamping force during the test with an accuracy of ±1% as stated in the test method may not represent the actual condition in bolted connections. As, such further research may be conducted to determine the actual clamping force during the slip resistance test when (i) a hydraulic jack is used to maintain the clamping force within ±1% accuracy and (ii) the bolt pretension simulates the actual condition in the joint by applying the clamping force before the test with no further adjustment during the test. In addition, previous research that led to code values for slip-resistance appears not to consider whether bolt relaxation will affect the intended pretension force and thus the associated slip-resistance coefficient. 2- The achieved level of surface roughness in this research was less than that specified by MTO (2 mils). However, due to the fact that there is no set surface roughness standard mentioned in the CHBDC or in any other literature, hence surface roughness level is left to the discretion of the researcher. This difference in surface roughness value would have a direct impact on the slip coefficient. As such, it is recommended that CSA-S6-14 and CSA-S16-14 specify the required surface roughness required to achieve the specified slip resistance factor specified in the code. 3- The method of blast-cleaning the surface was not mentioned in the code and thus research may be conducted by using different blasting process, which would give different surface roughness value. These methods are (i) sand-blasting with a specified sand particle size to reach the target surface roughness without smoothing the surface, (ii) shot-blasting with steel balls with specified diameters and (iii) grit blasting with irregular-shape aluminum oxide particles.

8 Chapter 8: EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION FOR BOLT RELAXATION AT ROOM TEMPERATURE
This chapter presents the results of bolt relaxation testing and the impact it may have on the initial clamping force at the time of slip-resistance testing. The results are presented in a Table 8-1 and Table 8-2 below, where a number of parameters are examined, namely: (i) the change in length over time; (ii) the percentage loss over time; (iii) the mean losses and (iv) the standard deviation of those losses. Yang et al. (2000) conducted bolt relaxation and the impact on (i) bolt tension force and (ii) shear capacity. They monitored relaxation for a period of 42 days. The parameter that was evaluated based on their research was the change in force. However, for this research, bolt relaxation was monitored for a period of 72 hours. Fisher et al. (1974) indicated that 90% of the loss in clamping force due to relaxation occurred within the first week after assembling. They, however, did not indicate at what particular time within this first week that this 90% loss was achieved. Also, the parameter been monitored in this research was the change in length of the bolt from the untensioned stage to the 72-hour period.

Bolt Relaxation at 173 kN and 203 kN Clamping Force
A mean percentage loss of 6% was observed for the 350W structural steel clean mill scale surface condition, after 36 hours and a mean percentage loss of 12% was observed after 72 hours, which had an initial clamping force of 173 kN. When a clamping force of 203 kN was applied to a plate of the same surface condition, a mean percentage loss of 17% was observed after 36 hours and a mean percentage loss of 26% was observed after 72 hours. For the hot dip galvanized plates with galvanized high strength bolts and clamped with an initial force of 173 kN, a mean percentage loss of 6% was observed after 36 hours and a mean percentage loss of 24% observed after 72 hours. However, for hot-dip galvanized plates with regular A325 high-strength bolt and clamped with the same initial clamping force, a mean percentage loss of 22% and 37% was observed after 36 hours and 72 hours, respectively. On the other hand, smaller mean percentage loss was observed for both hot-dip galvanized plates with high strength galvanized bolt when an initial clamping force of 203 kN was applied to the plates.

80

According to Fisher et al (1974), a minimum clamping force of 173 kN, applied using the normal bolt installation and tightening techniques, can produce a 13 % higher initial bolt force. However, when analysing the mean percentage losses after 72 hours (at which the slip test was conducted in this research), one can observe a high loss in clamping force due to bolt relaxation. This may have a negative impact on the slip-critical joint developing the required clamping force and thus affecting the slip load value for the determination of slip coefficient. It was also observed that the amount of relaxation for all surface treatment at the two clamping forces increase significantly at 72 hours from the time of applying it to the bolt. This would justify the lower slip load and hence the lower slip resistance coefficient in this research compared to those specified in the code.

9 Chapter 9: EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION ON THE TEMPERATURE EFFECTS ON SLIP COEFFICIENT
This chapter presents the results of the effect of temperature on slip coefficients. In this part of research, the steel plates, bolts, washers and nuts were placed in the environmental chamber at the target temperature for 36 hrs. Then, they were taken out of the chamber to apply the pretension force, then they the bolt-plate assembly was placed back in the chamber within 5 minutes after the loose parts were taken out. The assembly was left in the chamber for other 36 hrs and then each brought to the MTS machine to perform the slip test. For each temperature, 3 bolt-plate assemblies were considered for each plate surface condition.

Slip Resistance at a Target Temperature of -5ºC
Figure 9-1 through Figure 9-5 show sample graphs of the applied compressive load-displacement history for each surface condition within the -5ºC target temperature (with the rest of result graph presented in Appendix E). Table 9-1 through Table 9-5 show the mean slip load and slip coefficient of the various surface conditions at target temperature. With no set way in maintaining the assembly temperature throughout the slip test process, monitoring of the temperature change of each specimen was conducted. Figure 9-6 shows the change in temperature of the bolt-plate assembly, as measured by the thermocouples, during the slip test for one test specimen while Table 9-6 show the mean increase in temperature throughout the test for all the tested samples. Table F1 in Appendix F shows the actual temperature of the bolt-plate assembly at the time the slip coefficient was calculated (i.e. at 0.5 mm displacement). It can be observed that the actual temperature at the time of 0.5 mm displacement was greater that the target temperature of -5ºC. Thus, the results here may be considered as preliminary with which the hypnosis of the change in the slip resistance coefficient changes with changes in temperature at the time of the slip test can be examined. However, further tests can be conducted while the bolt-plate assembly is fully isolated to maintain the temperature during the slip test. Results showed that by maintaining the assembly target temperature at -5 ºC and changing the surface condition, there was a difference of 30,000 N between the highest mean slip load (stainless steel clean mill scale surface condition) and the lowest mean slip load (hot dip galvanized 350W structural steel) as shown in Table 9-3.

84

Similarly, the mean slip coefficient for the surface conditions at -5 ºC increased from 0.159 at ambient temperature to 0.239 at the target temperature.

Analysis of Temperature Effect on Slip Coefficient for Different Surface Condition
9.5.1 350W Structural steel material With the aim of testing in this phase of research been the analysis of temperature effect on slip coefficient performance, it was important to ascertain whether the degree of impact by temperature on the slip coefficient changes with different material and with different surface condition within the same material group. Based on testing results shown in Figure 9-24, for the clean mills scale surface condition of 350W structural steel, there is a decrease in the slip coefficient as the target temperature decreases from -5ºC to -20ºC. This decrease was in the order of approximately 12.8%. However, with a further decrease in temperature from -20ºC to -30ºC, there was an increase in the slip coefficient performance of approximately 12.8 %. Figure 9-25 for the 350W structural steel with blast-cleaned surface condition shows a more consistent performance of the slip coefficient when varying the target temperature, with slip coefficient remaining virtually the same throughout. This indicates that for the 350W structural steel with blast-cleaned surface condition, the effect of adverse temperature has no pronounce impact on the slip coefficient performance of the bolted joint connection.

It shows no definitive statistical pattern to say whether or not target temperature has a significant impact on the slip coefficient of this material with this surface condition. However, it is important to note that by comparing the slip

112

coefficient performance for the A1010 stainless steel with clean mill scale surface condition at adverse temperatures was slightly higher than that at room temperature. For the ASTM A1010 stainless steel with blast-cleaned surface condition, results followed a similar trend as the A1010 stainless steel with clean mill scale surface condition, showing insignificant effect of target temperature during the test on the value of slip coefficient, see Figure 9-27.

10: CONCLUSIONS AND

RECOMMENDATIONS

FOR

FUTURE WORK
Conclusions
The primary aim of this experimental research was to provide information on the slip coefficient performance of ASTM A1010 stainless steel material and to ascertain if its behaviour is comparable to that of 350W Structural Steel. In accomplishing this task, it was important to examine other parameters associated with slip resistance testing, such as (i) bolt relaxation and (ii) the effect of temperature variation and re-usability of high strength bolts. In the 2014 edition of the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code, the slip coefficient for clean mill scale and hot dip galvanized surface condition for the 350W structural steel is specified as 0.35, whereas for blastedclean surface condition is specified as 0.5. Based on test results, the following conclusions were drawn. a) The mean coefficient of slip resistance of ASTM A1010 stainless steel was greater than that of 350W structural steel for the clean mill scale surface conditions. Whereas, the mean coefficient of slip for the blast-cleaned surface condition for ASTM A1010 stainless steel did not outperformed the 350W structural steel. Though the slip coefficient values for both type of steel at various surface conditions were lower than those found in the CSA-S16-14 and CSA-S6-14, upon comparison with other research literature, such as Yura et al. (1981), the results obtained in this research were acceptable. b) Testing for the determination of slip coefficient in this research was done using actual conditions practiced within the steel industry. The bolt was first pretensioned to the target value, then the bolt-plate assembly was left 72 hrs before conducting the slip-resistance test. Then, the test was conducted with the actual clamping force in the bolt during the test that included effect of bolt relaxation. However, the ASTM test method and the research conducted to reach the slip coefficient values specified in the CHBDC mandated maintaining the clamping force through testing with a hydraulic jack and a load cell. This condition of maintaining clamping force during the test with an accuracy of ±1% as stated in the test method may not represent the actual condition in bolted connections. As, such further research may be conducted to determine the actual clamping force during the slip resistance test when (i) a hydraulic jack is used to maintain the clamping force within ±1% accuracy and (ii) the bolt pretension simulates the actual condition in the joint by applying

114

the clamping force before the test with no further adjustment during the test. In addition, previous research that led to code values for slip-resistance appears not to consider whether bolt relaxation will affect the intended pretension force and thus the associated slipresistance coefficient. c) The achieved level of surface roughness in this research was less than that specified by MTO (2 mils). However, due to the fact that there is no set surface roughness standard mentioned in the CHBDC or in any other literature, hence surface roughness level is left to the discretion of users (i.e. researchers and steel fabricators). This difference in the limiting value for surface roughness would have a direct impact on the slip coefficient value. As such, it is recommended that CSA-S6-14 and CSA-S16-14 specify the surface roughness required to achieve the specified slip resistance factor specified in the code. d) The method of blast-cleaning the surface, considered in this research, was not mentioned in the code and thus research may be conducted by using different blasting process, which would give different surface roughness values. These methods are (i) sand-blasting with a specified sand particle size to reach the target surface roughness without smoothing the surface, (ii) shot-blasting with steel balls with specified diameters and (iii) grit blasting with irregular-shape aluminium oxide particles. e) Within each surface condition, varying the temperature does not appear to have an impact on the slip coefficient performance. However, further research is research to support this finding by increasing number of tested samples and maintaining the plate-bolt assembly during slip test. f) Results on the bolt re-usability on A325 and Galvanized A325 high strength bolts showed that the bolt can be reused up to 5 times without lubrication. On the other hand, the maximum clamping force applied to B8 Class 1 stainless steel bolts did not reach 70% of the capacity of the bolt. As such, it is recommended to use such bolt type in bearing-type connection with snug-tight condition till further research is conducted to examine its applicability to slip-resistance connection. g) A standardized method of clamping force verification and application needs to be developed in order to eliminate ambiguity within future slip coefficient testing procedure.

115

Recommendations for Future Studies
This research is by no means a final conclusion on design of ASTM A1010 stainless steel slipresistance joint. Based on the experiments performed within this research, there exist a number of other research opportunities which can be explored within this field of study. The following are recommendations for future research: 1) Examining the impact of different bolt tensioning methods on the behaviour of slip-critical joint. 2) Enlarging the present testing pool to ascertain better statistical analysis of the data to obtain a more precise trend. 3) Increasing the temperature intervals when conducting the effect of temperature variation on slip coefficient testing while maintaining such temperature during the test to obtain a better statistical data. 4) The effect of bolt relaxation on slip critical joints can be further investigated considering relaxation over longer period of time. 5) Determination of the slip resistance coefficient when (i) a hydraulic jack is used to maintain the clamping force within ±1% accuracy and (ii) the bolt pretension simulates the actual condition in the joint by applying the clamping force before the test with no further adjustment during the test. 6) Examining the impact of the different method of obtaining blast-cleaned surface condition and determining the most appropriate method needed to obtain code results. These methods are (i) sand-blasting with a specified sand particle size to reach the target surface roughness without smoothing the surface, (ii) shot-blasting with steel balls with specified diameters and (iii) grit blasting with irregular-shape aluminium oxide particles. 7) Additional tests to be conducted on B8 Class 1 stainless steel bolt to (i) examine its capacity based on pull-out tension test as well as torque test and (ii) its applicability to use in slipcritical connections.
