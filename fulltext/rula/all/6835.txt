EMPOWER WOMEN: EXAMINING THE FEASIBILITY OF USING A 360° DIGITAL-FIRST MAGAZINE AS A HEALTH TEACHING AND KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION TOOL FOR MILLENNIAL WOMEN.

Master of Digital Media, 2017 Julene R. Chung Master of Digital Media, Ryerson University

ABSTRACT
Worldwide, women experience inequities in health due to unfair relations of power and control over their lives (Women and Gender Equity Knowledge Network, 2007). This is especially true in the area of women's health (Husoy-Onarheim, Iversen, & Bloom, 2016; Perry, 2012). As healthcare shifts to a health promotion model, women are being empowered through the facilitation of health literacy and informed decision-making (Wuest, Merritt-Gray, Berman, & Ford-Gilboe, 2002; Leaffer & Mickelberg, 2006). In recent years, digital media has become one of the primary ways millennial women access health information (Allison, et al., 2012). Yet there are limited resources that are accurate, engaging and easy to understand (Allison, et al., 2012; Calvillo, Roman, & Roa, 2013). This project examined the feasibility of using a digital magazine as a health teaching and knowledge translation tool for millennial Canadian women. The result of this project was a pilot 360° magazine experience designed to engage millennial women in discussions about taboo health topics. Keywords: digital media, health teaching, knowledge translation, magazine, millennials, sexual health, women.

INTRODUCTION
Digital technology is transforming healthcare and the way patients obtain health information (Women's College Hospital Institute for Health Systems and Virtual Care, 2016; Mackert, Champlin, Holton, Munoz, & Damasio, 2014). As a result, it is being increasingly important to seek health system solutions beyond the healthcare sector. One solution is the use of digital media to empower patients with accurate health information and self-care tools (Ministry of Health of Long-Term Care, 2015; Women's College Hospital Institute for Health Systems and Virtual Care, 2016). In recent years, the internet has become one of the primary ways that millennial women access health information (Allison, et al., 2012). There are a limited number of digital resources that contain accurate, engaging and easy to understand information (Allison, et al., 2012; Calvillo, Roman, & Roa, 2013). When seeking health information online, patients tend to visit blogs and digital magazines (Sanchez & Jones, 2016; Calvillo, Roman, & Roa, 2013). Magazines are especially powerful tools for sharing health information as magazines have unique influence over attitudes, behaviours and social constructs about health (Magazines Canada, 2016; Sanchez & Jones, 2016). This project examined the feasibility of using a digital magazine as a health teaching and knowledge translation tool for millennial women. The aim was to determine to create a 360° magazine experience that would engage young women in discussions about taboo health topics like sexually-transmitted HPV.. Hopefully, the information gathered from this MRP may provide initial insight to healthcare professionals looking to design similar projects.

BACKGROUND As the connections between social determinants, policy and health were revealed, a new definition of health emerged (Wuest, Merritt-Gray, Berman, & Ford-Gilboe, 2002). This definition of health incorporates physical, mental and social well-being (World Health Organization, 2016). In response, healthcare systems have shifted focus from bio-medical, curative healthcare models, in which healthcare providers hold the power, to a health promotion model, which empowers patients through the facilitation of informed decision-making (Wuest, Merritt-Gray, Berman, & Ford-Gilboe, 2002; Leaffer & Mickelberg, 2006). This is especially true in the area of women's health, where advances are intimately connected to advances in women's rights and status in society (Husoy-Onarheim, Iversen, & Bloom, 2016; Perry, 2012). Worldwide, women experience inequities in health due to unfair relations of power and control over their lives (Women and Gender Equity Knowledge Network, 2007). Women's health is intrinsically tied to social and economic status. Although women live longer than men, women experience poorer health outcomes such as higher incidence of chronic illness, lesser incomes and lower self-esteem (Wuest, Merritt-Gray, Berman, & Ford-Gilboe, 2002). Yet, research shows that "healthier women contribute to more productive and better educated societies" (Husoy-Onarheim, Iversen, & Bloom, 2016). Therefore, making improvements to women's health provides benefits to all (Husoy-Onarheim, Iversen, & Bloom, 2016; Women and Gender Equity Knowledge Network, 2007; Wilkinson & Pickett, 2010). Today, such improvements require interventions within and beyond the healthcare sector (Women and Gender Equity Knowledge Network, 2007).

How Digital Technology is Transforming Healthcare.

2

One solution is the use of information communication technology (ICT) within the healthcare sector, as known as digital health (Calvillo, Roman, & Roa, 2013). Digital health can be used to promote health literacy, provide remote access to care and create self-care tools (Calvillo, Roman, & Roa, 2013). These are all methods that facilitate patient empowerment; allowing patients to take control of the management of their health (Calvillo, Roman, & Roa, 2013). These new ways of connecting patients to health information and services may also increase the quality of healthcare delivery while reducing healthcare costs (Calvillo, Roman, & Roa, 2013). In 2015, the Ministry has developed an action plan to strengthen patient-centered healthcare in Ontario called Patient's First. In this plan, digital health is identified as a key tool for health system transformation (Ministry of Health of Long-Term Care, 2015). This is especially important for young women who experience unique barriers to receiving sexual health information and screening (Gray, Klien, Noyce, Sesselberg, & Cantrill, 2005; Eve Medical, 2016). These barriers include insufficient knowledge about STIs, concerns about confidently, difficulty accessing services and the discomfort associated with pelvic exams (Arias, et al., 2016; Gray et al,, 2005). In addition, it has been noted that "of all digital media, the internet has probably made the most significant impact on shaping a consumer revolution in healthcare communication" (Leaffer & Mickelberg, 2006). In fact, studies show that 80% of internet-users seek health information online and women of reproductive age tend to be the most frequent consumers of digital health information (Wallwiener, et al., 2016). Since digital media is a key way in which millennial women access health information, it is important for healthcare providers learn how to use its methods effectively. Improving health literacy through knowledge translation activities can help bridge the gap between new clinical
3

research insights and improved health outcomes (Boydell, Gladstone, Volpe, Allemang, & Stasiulis, 2012). Knowledge translation is defined as "a dynamic and iterative process that includes synthesis, dissemination, exchange and ethically-sound application of knowledge to improve the health of Canadians, provide more effective health services and products and strengthen the health care system" (Canadian Institutes of Health Research, 2016). Dissemination is an element of knowledge translation that "involves identifying the appropriate audience and tailoring the message and medium to the audience" (Canadian Institutes of Health Research, 2016). Thus, in order to be effective in disseminating knowledge to millennials, the health sector must engage in multifaceted approaches that involve digital media (World Health Organization, 2014; Allison, et al., 2012). Knowledge translation strategies that incorporate digital media and art have been identified as promising means to provide relevant and accessible health information to youth (Boydell, Gladstone, Volpe, Allemang, & Stasiulis, 2012; Sule & Inkster, 2015). For example, arts-based health research by Katherine Boydell and colleagues has found that health information conceptualized using art is more accessible, generates interest and mobilizes millennials as agents of change (Boydell, Gladstone, Volpe, Allemang, & Stasiulis, 2012). These strategies may be especially effective for reaching marginalized youth (Patton, et al., 2012; Sule & Inkster, 2015).

The Metamorphosis of the Modern Magazine Industry.
In Canada, millennials spend nearly 35 hours per week on digital media (Magazines Canada, 2014). Millennials use digital media to access entertainment (e.g. music, movies), read articles and to communicate with friends through social media or email (Magazines Canada,

4

2016). This form of communication has dramatically altered the way millennials gather and share information (Guse, et al., 2012). Digital and social media have the potential to provide innovative health promotion and risk reduction strategies designed specifically for millennials (Guse et al, 2012) (Bull, et al., 2012). However, it is still unclear what elements of digital and social media are most effective in generating change in health behaviours (Bull, Levine, Black, Schmiege, & Santelli, 2012) (Allison, et al., 2012). When seeking health information online, millennial women tend visit blogs, social media channels and digital magazines (Sanchez & Jones, 2016). Millennial women tend to seek out information on substance use, diet, exercise and sexual/reproductive health (Gray et al., 2005). Magazines are especially powerful tools for sharing such information as magazines have unique influence over attitudes, behaviours and social constructs about health (Magazines Canada, 2016; Sanchez & Jones, 2016; Friedman, Laditka, Laditka, & Matthews, 2010). This influence impacts the way the readers manage their health and engage in dialogue with healthcare providers (Sanchez & Jones, 2016). This can be helpful as motivation for self-care, but harmful if the information presented is incorrect or distorted (Sanchez & Jones, 2016). Because magazines publish health information alongside content like beauty and fashion, health information is often presented to readers in the form of "edutainment" - educational content presented in an entertaining way (Sanchez & Jones, 2016). Often, this negatively influences the accuracy, depth or relevance of the health information presented to the reader (Sanchez & Jones, 2016). This is why it is important for health experts to create, contribute to or review the information published in consumer magazines (Barwick & Lockett, 2012). A recent study of women's magazines found that publishers use health information to motivate readers to take responsibility for their health or to advocate for cause by sharing

5

someone's personal experience (Sanchez & Jones, 2016). Magazines also have the ability to generate discussion between the reader, her peers and her healthcare providers (Magazines Canada, 2016; Sanchez & Jones, 2016). Therefore, if properly utilized, a magazine can be an ideal tool for educating millennial women about complex or taboo health topics (Friedman, Laditka, Laditka, & Matthews, 2010). The rapid growth of digital media has caused major disruption to the magazine industry worldwide (Craig, 2016; Ontario Media Development Corporation, 2008; Tomas, 2013). Once thought to be dead, print magazines seem to be experiencing a metamorphosis as the medium takes on a new form of life and function for publishers (Chung, 2017). Print magazines have distinguishing features that better involve senses like touch and neurological pathways associated with memory (Latreille, 2016; Perbal, 2017). Some research also suggests more complex material is better understood when it is presented in printed text (Perbal, 2017). Thus, for now, the experience of reading a print magazine is more immersive than a digital magazine (Latreille, 2016; Perälä, 2014). The advantage of digital magazines is the ability to offer greater reach and engagement while benefiting from lower production costs (Sanchez & Jones, 2016; Ontario Media Development Corporation, 2008). Readers also turn to digital magazine content in order to gain easy access to content while they are on-the-go (Magazines Canada, 2016). In fact, Canadian magazine readers are strong users of social media and engage with their favourite magazine brands online between print issues (Magazines Canada, 2016). As time passes, it is clear to see that the choice between digital and print publishing is not a dichotomy but a spectrum of options for publishers. A growing number of magazine publishers' are now adopting a digital-first model (Craig, 2016) (Ontario Media Development Corporation, 2008). This means decreasing or discontinuing print-runs and increasing content
6

that drives readers to digital platforms (Craig, 2016). This is especially advantageous to publishers who create content for "digital natives," who are defined as "internet users born after 1980 [and] live much of their lives online without distinguishing between online and offline" (Palfrey & Gasser, 2008). This generation of media consumers are constantly connected to a digital device and spend more time online than any other generation (Magazines Canada, 2016; Palfrey & Gasser, 2008). Digital media is the digital native's primary method of day-to-day communication, knowledge exchange and creative expression (Palfrey & Gasser, 2008). Digital natives are also adept at multitasking and switching from one platform to the next (Magazines Canada, 2016; Palfrey & Gasser, 2008). Thus, it is essential that publishers use digital media in a way that is relevant and authentic in order to engage with and retain these readers (Magazines Canada, 2016). Thus, it is essential for magazine editors to think beyond static text, ensuring that there is a call to action, audio and/or visual experience for all editorial content (Talarico, 2016). This has pushed publishers to find creative ways to enhance the readers' experience with magazine brands (Tomas, 2013). This has given rise the 360° magazine experience. A 360° magazine experience is a way of modernizing magazines, so that publishers can reach readers through multiple methods and/or platforms (Magazines Canada, 2014). A 360° magazine experience can incorporate elements like print, digital, merchandise and in-real-life (IRL) events (Magazines Canada, 2014). The use of IRL events is especially popular as it also serves as a means to create additional editorial or social media content (Magazines Canada, 2015). Magazines like Spacing, Toronto Life, and Collective Hub have seen on-going success with hosting events that have attracted both readers and advertisers (Magazines Canada, 2015; Toronto Life, 2016; Collective Hub, 2017). The possibilities with IRL events are just as diverse as each magazine's audience.

7

Hence, it is essential that the publisher knows its readership well and accurately anticipate the readers' needs (Tomas, 2013; Magazines Canada, 2016). Equipped with this knowledge, this project aimed to create a 360° digital-first magazine experience designed to engage millennial women in discussions about taboo health topics. The pilot issue of the magazine included a digital edition with video enhancements, prompts for social media discussion and an IRL event. Throughout the project particular attention was paid to design aesthetic, tone, and format in order to make the pilot attractive to the target audience. This pilot is the first phase of an entrepreneurial endeavor. A magazine format was chosen because when examining media engagement academically or commercially, particular attention is paid to women's magazines (Perälä, 2014). The women's magazine industry is also successfully adapting new digital technology, such as augmented reality, to engage with readers on multiple platforms (Perälä, 2014; Milnes, 2016; Ontario Media Development Corporation, 2008).

OBJECTIVES
This project aims to examine if it is feasible to use a digital magazine as a health teaching and knowledge translation tool to reach millennial women. Through this project, my goals were to: (1) investigate various methods for modernizing the magazine experience through digital enhancements and to (2) create a health magazine experience that successfully engages with millennial women (18-30 years old) living in the Toronto-area. As mentioned in my Statement of Interest, I hoped that my studies in the Masters of Digital Media would provide me with the tools examine how digital media can be used to effect

8

change on adolescent health outcomes. With this project my learning goal was to create a knowledge translation product of my own from concept to completion. Doing so required the combination of my skills as a Registered Nurse and an entrepreneur. Altogether, this project helped to solidify my ability to bridge the gap between the digital media industry and healthcare industry. With additional resources, my goal is to continue the project by expanding its circulation and conducting an evaluation of the magazine's impact. To meet this goal, I will be applying for additional grants and business incubator programs. It is also my hope that information gathered from this project can provide initial insight to healthcare professionals or knowledge translation specialists looking to design similar digital products in the future. This report will discuss the methods used to create content, design the magazine, the social media strategy and conclude with a reflection on new knowledge gained from the project.

METHODS
As a whole, the vision for this project consists of five main phases: industry analysis, content creation, evaluation, dissemination and exchange . The industry analysis and content creation portions have been completed for the purpose of this MRP. Through the industry analysis, I examine the ways in which magazine publishers are utilizing digital technology to engage with readers. The analysis was conducted through a literature review, gathering of industry reports and by attending magazine industry events. Industry events attended included Making Digital-First Magazines (Canadian Society of Magazine Editors ­ March 2, 2017), Magazines in a Digital World (Interactive Ontario and Magazines Canada ­ March 28, 2017), MagNet (Canada's Magazine Conference April 25-28, 2017). Attending these events allowed me
9

to learn from the top magazine experts in Canada. A synopsis of my analysis was provided within the background section of this report. The full analysis can be found in my previous essay "Modernizing Print with Digital: Examining New Business Models in the Serial Publishing Industry" prepared for DG8111.

Content Curation and Creation.
When curating the content for the magazine editorial, I completed a scan of women's health organizations webpages and social media feeds to see which women's health topics experts were discussing among themselves. For example, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) was a topic I came across frequently. HPV as a sexual transmitted infection that is strongly associated with cervical cancer (Smith, et al., 2016). The Pap test is the established screening protocol for cervical cancer and focuses on detecting abnormal cells on the cervix. Women are accustomed to undergoing a Pap test as part of an annual physician exam. However, with the rise of new technology, public health organizations are looking to shift towards using HPV tests that detect the virus DNA even before changes to cervical cells can occur (Smith, et al., 2016). Prior to this shift in protocol, Canadian cancer and women's health organizations are designing campaigns to educate healthcare providers and the general public (Smith, et al., 2016; Federation of Medical Women of Canada, 2017). Throughout this report, I will be describing my process using the HPV article as the primary example. When researching this topic, I came across Eve Medical, a company that produces at-home HPV tests based in Toronto, Canada. The company is founded by a female entrepreneur who aims to empower women to take control of their own sexual health by providing a way for self-screening (Eve Medical, 2016). For the purpose of this project, I was

10

able to collaborate with Eve Medical to create a written article, on-site video and social media graphics addressing frequently asked questions about HPV* (see Appendix C). Collaborating with companies to co-develop content in this way is becoming standard practice in the magazine industry (Magazines Canada, 2016; deCarufel, 2017). Other important health topics discussed throughout the editorial include:  Dementia prevention through healthy lifestyle in earlier adult years* (The Lancet , 2017)  Vaginal health and vulvar skin integrity* (Dubé, 2017; Women's Health Queensland Wide Inc, 2015)  Connection between dental and overall health (article provided by dental expert, Dr. Andrea Gelinas)   How to build confidence (article provided by psychologist Dr. Stacy Thomas) Toxic chemical exposure at nail salons and a healthier beauty options* (National Networks on Environments and Women's Health, 2014)  Potential benefits of syncing skincare regiments with menstrual cycle (provided by skincare expert, Ms. Melissa Nkomo)  Personal narrative regarding experience with endometriosis (provided by Ms. Christina Paruag) Articles marked with a * were written by the author of this MRP. A sample article is included herein (see Appendix C). In order to be effective it was important to include information that was interesting, relevant and able to improve the wellbeing of the reader (Hoffman & Worrall, 2004). The
11

majority of women's health magazine focus on topics like aging, dieting and menopause (Friedman, Laditka, Laditka, & Matthews, 2010; Sanchez & Jones, 2016). Since the target audience for this project is between the ages of 18-30, I wanted to ensure that the information contained in the magazine was pertinent to the health concerns of younger women. Especially for those who may not have a designated healthcare provider. Following recommendations for effective health teaching materials by Hoffman and Worrall (2004), the magazine featured "how-to" information and content that focused on health behaviours. Thus, empowering the reader to make positive lifestyle changes and/or have informed conversations with a healthcare provider. As to not overwhelm the reader, the articles were clear and succinct; containing only information pertinent that would be pertinent to the reader. Effort was also made to ensure that the content was relatable to the personal circumstances of the reader, such as the experience of going to a nail salon. Each article also provided understandable examples, bringing the content closer to the reader's everyday life. The tone throughout is conversational and medical jargon was avoided. When medical terms were used, definitions were provided in lay terms. To further engage the reader, active voice and second person pronouns were used. It was also essential to build reader's trust with honest information about risks and benefits. To do so, I ensured that the information provided came from credible academic or clinical sources. Short biographies of the health experts who contributed articles were also provided to establish credibility (Hoffman & Worrall, 2004). In the HPV article, for example, the frequently asked questions addressed were based on the findings of Smith and Colleagues in Recommendations for Implementing Human Papillomavirus-based Cervical Cancer Screening: Lessons Learned from the HPV FOCAL Trial (Smith, et al., 2016). In their commentary Smith and colleagues recommend providing basic
12

information about HPV, its connection to cervical cancer, destigmatizing HPV infection and explaining how HPV tests differ from Pap tests (Smith, et al., 2016). The researchers also provided a list of frequently asked questions. I used this information to create both content for both the magazine article and HPV-related videos. In addition to featuring relevant health topics, it was also important to carry on the theme of women's empowerment by including writers who identify as women and products made by women-owned companies. Product placement was clearly indicated to ensure transparency with the reader. Each article was also reviewed for accuracy, neutrality and adherence to best health practice guidelines. Submissions to the magazine were voluntary. There was no advertising space sold or monetary exchange for inclusion in this project.

Application of Cognitive Psychology and Design Principles.
The digital magazine in this project was given the title Myrrh. This name is a reference to a plant resin used in medicines, beauty regimens and prayer rituals since ancient times (Walsh, Reis, & Jones, 2010). Hence, myrrh is a symbol of healing; encompassing both physical and spiritual health. Using Myrrh as the title of this publication reflects its mission to promote a holistic definition health, in keeping with the World Health Organization's principles (World Health Organization, 2016). As this is a knowledge translation and health teaching tool, it was also essential to examine how cognitive psychology and design elements can used to enhance health education materials ( Whittingham, Ruiter, Castermans, Huiberts, & Kok, 2008; Flicker, et al., 2008). In the field of cognitive psychology there are several well-established principles that can be used to increase the comprehension of health messages ( Whittingham, Ruiter, Castermans, Huiberts, &

13

Kok, 2008). These principles are derived from the area of cognitive ergonomics, which is defined as a domain of ergonomics "concerns with mental processes such as perception, memory, reasoning and motor response...as they may relate to human system design" ( (International Ergonomics Association, 2017). By using these principles throughout the project, I hope to optimize the amount of information the reader uptakes and understands ( Whittingham, Ruiter, Castermans, Huiberts, & Kok, 2008). Doing so, allows the reader to make successful connections between new and prior knowledge; increasing the probability that newly learned information will be stored in the reader's long term memory ( Whittingham, Ruiter, Castermans, Huiberts, & Kok, 2008). According to the dual code theory, for example, information that is presented to both the verbal and visual cognitive systems at the same time helps to establish better connections within the reader's memory. These connections can aide with the reader's comprehension and recollection of the learning materials ( Whittingham, Ruiter, Castermans, Huiberts, & Kok, 2008). Thus, in the project, each article in the magazine was paired with an attractive main image that represents the information in the text. When designing the cover for the publication, I wanted to ensure it was able to attract attention while clearly communicating the purpose of the magazine (Hoffman & Worrall, 2004). I also wanted to ensure that if the magazine was to be on the newsstand, it would fit in with other wellness publications but stand out with the subtle use of vibrant colours. The image on the cover of the magazine was photographed on a lavender farm in rural Ontario. The colour of the lavender portrayed wisdom, royal value and spirituality (Singh & Srivastava, 2011). And the yellow in the clothing represents optimism, joy and femininity (Singh & Srivastava, 2011). The layout of the magazine was created using Adobe Creative Cloud ­ InDesign. I choose a minimalist style that would allow for the magazine text to be framed in sufficient white
14

space and a serif type font in black as this pairing is easiest to read (Hoffman & Worrall, 2004). Navigation from one section to the next is simple and intuitive. There is a table of contents that uses the article's main images as a guide. The reader can simply click through each page or select the thumbnails to jump to the article she desires. As mentioned previously, the final version of this magazine will also be available in print and paired with a smartphone app, thus it was important that the design suited both print and digital distribution. See Future Directions for more details.

Knowledge Translation and Social Media Strategy.
Since this project aims to reach millennial women, a key part of the knowledge translation strategy involves social media use. The primary social media channel utilized in this strategy is Instagram. This channel was chosen as it is my start-up's strongest social media channel with 710 followers. Demographics for this group are: 87% women, 14% 18-24 years old, 57% 25-34 years old and 71% from Toronto or surrounding cities. Throughout the month of September, Myrrh will release bi-weekly video content that directly relates to the magazine editorial. This will lead up to women's health awareness days that will be occurring in September and October. For example, there are a series of "Nurse Jules" videos in which I answer frequently asked questions about HPV. Each video encourages viewer to access additional resources linked below the video and to join the online discussion using #discussmyrrh hashtag discussion. Segments of the videos, 30-60 seconds in length, will also be distributed through Instagram and Twitter to drive the audience to the full video on YouTube. Production of these videos was funded by the Social Enterprise Demonstration Fund. Special attention will be paid to the titles of the videos and keywords used titling for the purpose

15

of search engine optimization. Content for this video will be distributed ahead of Canada's inaugural HPV awareness week, October 1-7, 2017 (Federation of Medical Women of Canada, 2017). Distribution on Twitter is more likely to attract the attention of professionals and thought leaders in healthcare. Whereas, social media posts on Instagram will reach our target audience. The designated hashtag for the project is #discussmyrrh. It is a unique hashtag that is not associated with any previous or competing content on Instagram. This hashtag was used as a part of the Instagram stories that were run as teasers to help build up anticipation for the project (see appendix D). This hashtag will also be used to facilitate online discussion when the corresponding videos are released. The end of the HPV Myth or Fact video, for example, has a prompt for viewers to discuss their reactions to the video using the hashtag. As both the editor and a Registered Nurse, I will be able to follow this hashtag to engage with readers, answer their inquiries and/or refer them to local service providers if needed. In keeping with the principles of a 360° magazine experience, I marked the launch of Myrrh with a pop-up event in August. The event was coordinated in partnership with PhotoEd Magazine as part of their two-week Plant Life gallery/showroom which featured the sale of botanical prints and succulents. During the Myrrh pop-up I arranged complimentary hand massages from a local, natural beauty brand and complimentary nail polish changes using products from a New York-based company. These products were styled using a marble slab and miniature greenhouse display to reflect the botanical theme of the event. Cupcakes, popcorn and a pink elderberry cordial were also refreshments. This purpose of this event was to provide an inviting introduction to the Myrrh brand. As an after-work event, I utilized the trending hashtag #motivationmonday during the event to invite guests to indulge in the self-care activities being offered. Once attendees were at the event, they were also able to meet with a representative of
16

Eve Medical who was on hand to answer questions about their HPV test device, the eve kit. Attendees were also able to engage with the physical device in order to have a better understanding of how the device functioned. Boomerang and standard video coverage from the event were distributed through Instagram stories to provided extended audience reach. The best content from the day was then posted on the Instagram grid as permanent content. Incorporating an IRL event into the project launch was important for establishing the brand's authenticity as attendees were able to meet representatives of the companies involved, face to face. It also provided opportunities to partner with complimentary brands and gain an extended audience. In the future, Myrrh events will also be an important tool for generating income, brand visibility and reader loyalty (Magazines Canada, 2015).

OUTCOMES
Unfortunately I was unable to present this project to a focus group for formal evaluation of this project as originally planned. Instead, I have reviewed the social media metrics. The initial reactions to the Myrrh project have been positive thus far. The Instagram posts pertaining to the project have generated 413 likes and 265 video views. Comments received include, "so pretty," "wow," "we're so excited" and "excited for the first issue." I hope to maintain this momentum as more content released throughout September and October. As per my Statement of Interest, one of my main objectives for applying to the Master of Digital Media program was to position myself as a healthcare professional who can utilize digital media as a knowledge translation tool. As a self-directed learner, I have kept this goal intact by pursuing external learning opportunities. While completing this MRP, I took a health informatics course and participated in a summer student research program at a local women's hospital.

Doing so, enriched my knowledge of health systems, policy, and the health gap experience by women across Ontario. It also allowed me to refine the magazine content and social media strategy for this MRP. Through this work I was able to gain a greater understanding of ways to disseminate complex medical information using well-established health teaching techniques. This is my first trial at examining how these techniques can be digitalized. I was also able to examine how a powerful lifestyle marketing tool (a magazine) can be transformed into an effective health teaching tool. The knowledge I gathered allowed be to create a pilot magazine that can be used to build a hybrid print/digital magazine experience.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The work presented in this MRP will be continued as an entrepreneurial endeavor. After the evaluation of this project, my goal is to establish strong magazine circulation by building its own digital platform and an accompanying smartphone app. The smartphone app with utilize augmented reality (AR) technique to link the print magazine to digital content like video or sound. I am currently seeking the support of local business incubator programs to assist with this.

A. How Digital Technology is Transforming Healthcare

Digital technology is transforming the healthcare sector. It allows for improvements in the way healthcare professionals provide care (remotely or at the bedside), access patient health records, educate patients and improves access to self-care tools (Ministry of Health of Long-Term Care, 2015; Women's College Hospital Institute for Health Systems and Virtual Care, 2016).

B. The 360° Magazine Experience

A 360° magazine experience is a way of modernizing magazines, so that publishers can reach readers through multiple methods and/or platforms. A 360° magazine experience can incorporate elements like print, digital, merchandise and in-real-life (IRL) events (Magazines Canada, 2014). Image created by Julene Chung.
