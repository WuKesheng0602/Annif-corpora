ABSTRACT
Repair and rehahilitation of existing structures is becoming a major part of the present construction activities. Corrosion of rcinf()rcemcnt is a major contributing factor to the detcrioration of reinforced concrete steel structure. COITosion of reint()J"cing steel severely intluenccs thc bond at the steel-concrete interface.

The aim of this research is to study the effect of cOlTosjon on bond strength using pullout specimens and t()Ur different types of concrete having three ditferent types of steel embcdded. The study is conducted for tour levels of con'osion ranging t1'om uncorroded to severely corroded specimens. The four concretc types used were tly ash concrete mixture. silica fume concretc mixturc. normal P0I11and ccment (NPC) concretc mixturc with a water/cement ratio (w/c) of 0.32. and a 0.52 wlc ratio concrete mixture. Each type of these concretes has three different types of steel embedded in them: regular carbon. stainless. and cpoxy coated steel bars. The relationship between the bond strength, weight loss and the rib profile loss is studied. The results showed preference for using regular carbon steel bars than stainless steel bars. stainless steel bars exhibited badly damaged shape with lots of voids compared to the rcgular carbon steel bars. Also. the bond strength tor corroded and un-corroded stainless steel bars was lower than that of the regular carbon steel bars. Low levels of corrosion (ahout 0.5 to 1 % of mass loss) were notcd to improve thc bond strength slightly when using either regular carbon stcel bars or stainless steel bars

embedded in any type of the concrete mixtures. However. bond strength decreases rapidly with an increase in the cOl1'osion level for both regular carbon and stainless steel bars in any type of the concrete mixtures used. The use of supplementary cementing materials (SCM) such as tly ash and silica fume was very etfective in delaying the corrosion process compared to that of NPC concrete with no SCM. Also, the bond perfonnance of any steel bars embedded in NPC concrete with low w/c (0.32) was found to be superior to that of a concrete mixture with high w/e (0.52). However. the bond strength for F.A and S.F concrete was slightly lower than that of the NPC concrete with 0.32 w/c ratio.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 General
Recently the aspects of concrete durability and perfonnance have become a major subject of discussion especially when the concrete is subjected to a severe environment. Con"osion of steel bars is the main factor influencing both the concrete durability and strength. The corrosion products of the steel reinforcement expand up to seven times the original size, developing high pressures within the concrete, which cause cracking and spalling of the concrete cover and expose the rebar to further corrosion activity.

"In the United States. there are more than 581,000 bridges in the national highway infrastructure system. Nearly 32% of these bridges are listed as structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. The cost of repairing and replacing these bridges is estimated at $100 billion. and approximately 20 percent of the total estimated cost is due to the cOlTosion deterioration of concrete bridges. Based on the infomlation provided by the Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP). it is estimated that the cost of the con"osion damage in the United States transportation system now stands at over $20 billion. and it is increasing at the rate of $500 million per year. From a survey of collapsed buildings in England from 1974 to 1978, eight concrete building stmctures collapsed because of the cOITosion of the steel reinforcement. In 1975. the U.S. Interstate Highway Systcm alone reported the need for US $6 billion fi)r rcpair and replacement of reinforced concrete bridge decks. In addition, it was reported that at least 4800 of the 25000 bridges in the State of Pennsylvania were found to be in dire need of repair" (Amleh 2000).

Bond stress is the shear stress over the surface of the bar, and is defined as the change in the force within the reinforcing bar divided by the area of that bar surface over which the change in the force takes place. Bond stress initially comes from weak chemical bonds between steel and hardened hydrated cement paste in the concrete. but

this resistance is broken at a very low stress. Once slip occurs, friction contributes to the hond, hut with increasing slip between bar and concrete, bond comes to depend principally on the bearing of the lugs on the concrete, or mechanical interlock of the ribs rolled on the surface of the bar with the concrete. In this stage, the reinforcing bar generates hursting force tends to split the surrounding concrete. However the resistance provided by the concrete cover and the confining reinforcement may limit the failure load. Many researchers have investigated the effect of reinforcement corrosion on the bond strength and noted a significant decrease in the bond strength with the increase in the level of corrosion. They attribute the degradation of the bond strength to the formation of weak and friable material between the bar and the concrete. They also found that the increases in the diameter of the corroded bar develops a longitudinal cracks which reduce the resistance to the bursting forces generated by bond action and cause a great bond degradation.

Con·osion could be expected to affect bond strength between the steel reinforcement and concrete. the expansion due to the corrosion products at first increases radial stresses between bar and concrete and hence increase the frictional component of hondo However, further corrosion develops longitudinal cracking and reduction in the resistance to the bursting forces generated around the steel bar. Some researchers suggest that a firmly adherent layer of rust may contribute to an enhancement in bond strength at early stages of corrosion (AI- Sulaimani et al 1990), but at more advanced stages of corrosion, weak and friable material between bar and concrete will certainly be at least partially responsible for the reduction in bond strength (Cabrera and Ghodussi 1991).

Corrosion reduces the ribs height of the defonned bar which causes reduction in the contact area between the ribs and the concrete leading to reduction in the hond strength. This is usually happened at advanced stages of corrosion. Corrosion also may affect the rib face angle in the advanced stages; moreover ribs of defol111ed bars will eventually be lost at high level of corrosion. Corrosion of reinforced bar is usually associated with the increase of the crack width. The increase of the con·osion products around the bar leads to increase of bursting force and tension cracking of the

surrounding concrete, as the con'osion increase, the cracks width becomes wider and the bond strength decreases.

1.2 Scope and objectives

The main objective of this research is to study the effect of cOITosion on bond strength lIsing four differellt types of concrete with three different types of steel embedded. The study is conducted for four levels of corrosion, from uncorroded bars to extreamly corroded bars. The four concrete types used were fly ash concrete mixture, silica fume concrete mixture, nomlal Portland concrete mixture with a water to cement ratio (w/c) of 0.32. and a high water to cement concrete mixture (0.52). Each type of these concretes has three different types of steel embedded in them: regular carbon, stainless, and epoxy-coated steel bars. The surface of the cross-sectional area of the embedded end of the epoxy-coated bars was left uncoated after cutting the bars to the required lengths. The cross-sectional area was left uncoated to study the effect of corrosion concentration in a small area on the concrete cracking.

CHAPTER 2

THE BOND MECHANISM
2.1 Introduction
Bond between reinforcement and concrete is necessary to ensure composite action of the two materials. The nomlal assumptions of plain section behavior used in section analysis _ and design rely on composite interaction being achieved. Bond stress is the shear stress over the surface of the bar. which is a considerably simplified representation of the "actual" conditions. Bond stress is defined as the change in the force within the reinforcing bar divided by the area of that bar surface over which the change in the force takes place. In other words, bond stress is the shear stress transferred from the concrete to the reinforcing bar to change the bar stress from point to point which depends on the development length and the change in the bending moment along the member. Bond stress initially comes from the weak chemical bonds between the steel and the hardened hydrated cement paste of that concrete, but with a little increase of the applied load on the steel bar this resistance is lost. Once slip occurs, friction contributes to the bond. but with increasing slip between the bar and the concrete, bond resistance is derived principally from the beming, or mechanical interlock, of the ribs on the surface of the bar with the concrete. At this stage. the reinforcing bar generates bursting forces results from the horizontal component of the force acting between the concrete and the lib face angle. This force tends to split the surrounding concrete, and the resistance provided by the concrete cover and the confining reinforcement to these bursting forces may limit the failure load.

2.2 Bar-concrete interaction
Based on a prevIous study by Leroy et al (1967). the force in the steel bar that is transmitted to the sUITounding concrete by bond can be classified into three components:

(a) Chemical adhesion, (b) Friction, (c) Mechanical interaction between the concrete and the steel. Bond of plain bars depend primarily on the first two elements in addition to the effect of the end anchorage, although there is some mechanical interlocking due to the roughness of the bar surface. Defollned bars, however, depend primarily on mechanical interlocking for superior bond properties. This does not mean that friction and chemical adhesion are negligible in the case of defollned bars. but that they are secondary. However. the scientists. who have contributed,to the knowledge of the many aspects of bond (Task group bond model 2000), agree that the interaction between the concrete and the bar subjected to a tensile force is characterized by four different stages (Fig.2.I), these stages are: · · · · · · Stage 1 (Uncracked stage) Stage 11 (Microcracks) Stage III (splitting cracking) Stage IVa (Bond failure of plain bars) Stage IVb (Bond failure of deformed bars surrounded by light confinement) Stage IYc (Bond failure of deformed bars surrounded by heavy confinement)

Stage I (lJncracked stage)
The maximum bond stress that the plain bar can resist without slipping is defined as (Fig. 2.1), At this stage, the bond stress
(t) tIPS

is less than the maximum bond stress

tIP',

and

chemical adhesion is responsible for the bond et1iciency, and no bar slip occurs, however localized stress occurs close to the lug tips. Choi and Lee (2002) found that adhesion ranges from 1.0 to 2.0 MPa, is appropriate for the analysis of the bond of defonned bars and concrete.

ACI Committee 40S (1991) suggested that the bond strength due to adhesion is between 0.4S-1.03 MPa. Cairns and Abdulla (1994) studied the adhesion between the concrete and steel plates; they compared the bond characteristics at the interface of a steel plate with mill-scale. and the concrete with that of a fusion-bonded epoxy-concrete interface. Specimens were cast in which the concrete was sandwiched between two plates of steel and two plates of steel with epoxy coating. A normal stress of 9 MPa was applied to the specimen prior to loading it in shear until a slipping failure occurred. They observed minimal adhesion in the case of the coated plates, and the coated plates were noted to be clean after failure, while the uncoated plates were covered with a layer of crushed mOliar.

Stage II (Microcracks)
The maximum bond stress that the defonned bar can resist without occurring a transverse microcracks is defined as tl DS (Fig. 2.1). At this sta~e, the bond stress (t) is higher than
tIDS. the

chemical adhesion breaks down at this stage, the lugs induce large bearing stresses

in the concrete p* (defined as the reaction of the bar lugs bearing against the concrete) (Fig. 2.2.a) and transverse microcracks originate at the tips of the lugs as well as compressing of the porous concrete in front of the lug (in some cases due to lack of compaction) allowing the bar to slip, but the wedging action of the lugs remain limited and there is no concrete splitting. (Fig. 2.2.b)

Stage III (splitting cracks)

At this stage. when continuous increase of bond stress takes place, the longitudinal cracks (splitting cracks) spread radially, owing to the wedging action, which is enhanced by the concrete crushing in front of the lugs (Fig. 2.2.c).
It was observed by Rehm (1968) that the slip resistance upon reloading is considerably

higher than the slip resistance found initially, which was attributed to the ribs that are bearing against the compacted· nonporous crushed concrete at the second loading compared with the porous intact concrete during the initial loading. Fig. 2.3 shows a decrease of the slip resistance for the defon11ed bars after reloading when the rib face angle is greater than 40 ".

Stage IVa (Bond failure of plain bars) As explained earlier, in the case of plain bars, the bond resistance is assumed to be chemical adhesion between the mortar paste and the bar surface, however, low stresses will cause sufficient slip to break the adhesion between the concrete and the steel. Once slip occurs, further bond resistance is developed only by friction and by the wedging action of small dislodged sand particles between the bar and the surrounding concrete. This stage immediately follows the depletion of adhesive bond, and failure occurs when the adhesion and friction resistance is overcome, and the bars usually pull out from the encasing concrete.

Stage (Vb (Bond failure of deformed bars surrounded by light confinement) The bond in this stage tends to fail abruptly in the case of defonned bars sUITounded by light continement; the longitudinal cracks accompanied by slip on the rib face break out through the entire cover thickness (Fig. 2Ac).

Chapter 2

In the case of sufficient amount of transverse reinforcement (medium confinement) is provided. a longitudinal cracks accompanied by crushing or shearing-off in the concrete below the ribs will occur through the entire cover thickness (Fig. 2.4b). The bond stress values as h5gh as (1/3 -1 /2)
f~

can be developed during this stage, with the unavoidable and

often unacceptable side-effect represented by very high slip values.

Stage IVc (Bond failure of deformed bars surrounded by heavv confinement) In the case of det'{mlled bars suiTounded by heavy confinement, splitting does not occur and bond failure is caused by bar pullout. The force transfer mechanism changes from rib bearing to friction along the vertical line between the tops of the ribs as seen in Figure 2.4a. Under continued loading, the interface is smoothed due to wear and compaction. leading to a further decrease of bond resistance.

As far as Stage III is concerned, due to the build-up of the wedging action exel1ed by the bars and to the propagation of the splitting cra.cks, all possible contribution to the confinement are mobilized: in fact, the confinement efficiency depends on the concrete cover thickness, bar spacing (Ferguson 1966; Edwards and Jannopoulos, 1978; Ferguson et a\., 1954; Morita and Kaku, 1979), reinforcement, and transverse pressure.

2.3 Effect of bar profile on bond strength

As it is we11 known, the theory of reinforced concrete is based on stress transfer between the reinforcing steel bars and the surrounding concrete. This transfer of load or stress is made possible hy the resistance to relative motion or slippage hetween the concrete and the surface of the embedded steel bar. The resistance to slippage occurs due to the bond at the steel-concrete interface.

Previous hond research (Rehm, 1961; Lutz, Gergely, and Winter 1966; Soretz, and Holzenhein. 1979: Kimura, Hideka and Jirsa,1992: Darwin and Eheneze, 1993) involving

pullout and beam-end tests of regular and specially machined bars, indicates that the geometry and shape of bar defonnations affect the bond strength of anchored bars. It was concluded from their studies that bond perfonnance of defonned bars would improve with an increase in the rib height or decrease in rib spacing, an increase in rib bearing area-torib shearing area ratio (or approximately rib height-to-rib spacing ratio), or an increase in the rib face angle above 45 deg. Today, the ratio of rib bearing area-to-rib shearing area is alternately known as the relative rib area Rr that is the ratio of the projected rib area (nonnal to bar axis) to the product of the nominal bar perimeter by the center-to-center rib spac1l1g.

Choi and Lee (2002) found that the effective rib face angel (as a result from the cnlshing of the concrete in front of the rib) ranges between 25 and 35 degrees which is lower than the actual rib face angel. and the relative rib area has a little effect on the bond strength of deformed bars when the bars are not confined by transverse reinforcement. Lutz, Gergely, and Winter (1966) predicted that bars with a large rib face angle would be less affected by grease or other friction-reducing agents than bars with a flatter rib face angle. Tfthe face of the rib fonned an angle of 90 degree with the axis of the bar, all of the bond strength would be produced by the direct bearing of the rib against the concrete key. In this case, friction between the concrete and steel would be unnecessary, on the other hand bars with 90 degree angle could have insufficient compaction of the concrete in front of the rib which oppositely affect the bond strength. However, for a plain bar (a rib face angle of 0 degree), tj'iction caused by adhesion between the concrete and steel would be the only bond component, and loss of this adhesion would destroy the bond. As the rib face angle becomes larger, the contribution of the friction component parallel to the face of the rib to the bond strength becomes snialler. Therefore, the loss of adhesion becomes less significant.

2.3.1 Effect of the geometry and shape

David (1941), investigated the effect of different bar geometry on bond stress. He found that the stress transmission from the loaded end to the free end was higher in case of plain hars than in the case of ribbed bars. Also, it was observed that the stress in the ribbed steel har was higher near the loaded end than in case of plain bars, and this may attributed to thc increase of bond resistance due to the ribs action, which is not available.

Another study by Maslehuddin et al (1990) evaluated the effect of the steel surface condition on the bond with the concrete; one of their objectives was to evaluate the effect of several rust degrees on the steel surface and the corresponding bond with the concrete. The study was conducted for several bar diameters subjected to different degrees of atmosphere exposure. The results of this experimental work indicated that there was no change in the bond between concrete and 16 mm diameter samples due to atmospheric corrosion. In the case of 32 mm diameter bars, there was a slight increase in the bond resistance with increasing periods of atmospheric exposure. He attributed the results due to the filling of shallow gaps between the lugs in small size bars by the rust fonned during atmospheric exposure, thus producing a plain surface effect in the case of rusted bars compared to a ribbed surface in the fi-esh samples. However, in larger bars, with the large size ribs. the slight increase of bond stress with the time of exposure is probably due to the increased roughness developed due to atmospheric exposure.

2.3.2 Effect of rib angle, rib spacing, and rib height Several researches have evaluated the effect of the rib geometry on the bond performance of the steel bar. Cairns and Abdullah (1994) studied the effect of the reduction of bond stress in fusion-bonded epoxy-coating reinforcement (FBECR); they also evaluated the variation in bond stress with rib face angle for machined bars. Figure 2.5 shows the variation in rib face angle fi'om 30 to 75. with the bond stress and the con'esponding slips. At slips 0.0 1 and 0.1 mm, the bond stress slightly increases with the increase in the rih

face angle. At the failure load (slip 1 mm), the bond stress increases with the increase of rib angle from 30 to about 55 or 60. This may be attributed to the increase of bearing force due to the increase of bearing area. It should be mentioned that the large increase in the rib face angle can result in an insufficient concrete compaction below the rib and this factor should be taken in to consideration to design the rib face angle.

2.4 Effect of casting position and concrete confinement on the bond strength
According to Park andPaulay (1975), the load-bond slip relationship for defonned bars is primarily affected by the quality of the concrete in front of the bar ribs. The quality of the concrete in this region depends on its relative position of casting. Figure 2.6 shows the effect of different casting position on the bond slip relationship. Soft and spongy layer of concrete can fonn under the ribs in case of casting perpendicular to the bar length (number 3 Fi!:,rure 2.6). This results in a higher slip (compared to the other casting positions) due to the crushing of the weak concrete under the ribs. The effect of casting position on bond is even more severe for plain bars. Figure 2.7 shows the efTect of casting position for 16 mm plain bars. The upper curves of each pair in the figure were obtained for heavily rusted and pitted bars. The lower curves of each pair is for smooth surface bars. The ultimate bond strength is drastically reduced in the case of

Chapter 2 horizontal bars as compared with vet1ical bars. It is to be expected that the top bars in a beam will have poorer bond characteristics than the bottom bars, since the water and air gain will be greater under top bars. In addition, the relative downward movement of the sUITounding concrete caused by settlement of the fresh mixture, can he large. The amount of settlement that can occur depends on the extent of bleeding of the fresh concrete and the rate of the water is pennitted to escape from the fonnwork (Park and Paulay 1975).

Welch and Patten (1967) studied this effect and compared the bond perfOnl1anCe of bars sun·ounded by concrete in leaky timber molds and in well-sealed steel moulds. ]n the latter they also delayed the placing of the concrete by 40 minutes. Fig. 2.8 demonstrates their results, the upper two curves indicate to the delayed placing for top and bottom bars and the lower part indicates to the leaky timber mold placing for the same bars. This shows the efl'ect of concrete settlement on bond, particularly for top bars. The ACI code recognizes this phenomenon by requiring 40% excess development length for top-cast defonlled bars.

The widening of splitting cracks can be restricted if the concrete that sun·ounds a bar is confined in certain areas, such as at the simply supported ends of beams. transverse compression is nonllally available from the reaction force. Transverse compression is beneficial to the anchorage of reinforcement.

Increased concrete cover has been found to produce some increase in the resistance against splitting however, the improved bond perfonnance is not proportional to the additional cover thickness. For large size bars. the beneficial effect is not very significant. For these bars. as a rule. the etlect on the fonnation and widths of cracks under service load condition is the governing criterion in selecting an appropriate value for allowable average bond stress. Extra cover does not provide protection against excessive surface crack width: medium sized top bars appear to benefit more from added cover.

Sti,Tups. pat1icularly when closely spaced. prevent the opening of cracks that f0l111 along

the embedded bars and enable greater bond forces to be transmitted. In many situations. this is only possible if the shearing stresses are transmitted across splitting cracks by means of ag!,'Tegate interlock.

CHAPTER 3 BOND PERFORMANCE
3.1 Overview of high performance concrete

Many researchers reported that the mam microstructure characteristics for high perfonnance concrete (HPC) are its dense microstructure even at the interfacial region and the strong bond between the aggregate and the matrix. Manufacture of HPC entails the use of low ratios of water to cementitious materials (w/cm) and supplementary cementing material (SCM). To understand the influence of using supplementary cementing materials like silica fume, tly ash, etc. as a partial replacement of cement, a quick overview for the propel1ies of these materials and the effect of using them in concrete should be demonstrated.

3.1.1 Overview of supplementary cementing materials

The use of SCM's such as ground bTfanulated blast furnace slag, fly ash, and silica fume, has become common with the production of concrete because of their economic value and other benetits.

In the case of high performance concrete (HPC), the incorporation of one or more types of the SCM, together with a low water/cement ratio (u·sually a supeqJlasticizer is used in these mixes and sometimes with very high dosage to maintain adequate workability), has proved to improve greatly the microstructure over that of concrete with ordinary w/c (Mehta 1981). The SCM particles have very high surface area, which consume pat1 of the mixing water to get their surface wet, results in a very little free water left in the mix for bleeding. Also, the SCM improves the concrete microstructure by either filler effect and/or chemical effect (pozzolanic reaction). At early ages, the tiller etreet of SCM is responsible for the improvement in densitication of the microstructure. The SCM improves packing of the hydration products especially around the aggregate pat1icles.

Chapter 3

At later ages. the chemical effect (pozzolanic reaction) adds to the improvement of the microstructure. The pozzolanic reaction of SCM is mainly by reaction with the calcium hydroxide crystals (the main By-Product from the hydration of n0n11al cement) that nucleated earlier around the SCM pat1icles. The pozzolanic reaction produces more calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) gel, which is the main cementitious product ti'om the hydration of nonnal cement. C-S-H will effectively tie together the hydration products and the unhydrated cement particles leading to more homogeneous and denser matrix.

The chemical efrect of SCM is consumption calcium hydroxide (CH) crystals with time and replacing them by C-S-H gel, leading to a reduction in the concentration of CH and porosity in the transition zone as well as an increase in the bond between the aggregate and the matrix (Larhi J 993). Goldman and Bentur (1993) concluded that improving the aggregate Imatrix bond will induce the "true" composite behavior of the concrete in which the aggregate acts as an active reinforcing inclusion.

Mehta (1986) refetTed to the process of transfonning the large grains of a system into a series of smaller grains as "grain size refinement". The high perfonnance concrete is characterized by its low content of CH crystals, which if present are not well crystallized (Sarkar and Aitcin 1987). The addition of SCM '[etines the pore distribution and produces a discontinuous pore structure with less pcnneability. This is attributed to the development of a denser structure and the replacement of CH by C-S-H gel. Figure 3.1 shows the change in the pore size distribution of cement paste with varying pozzolan content. The figure bars indicate to the size of the pore for ditferent percentage of pozzolan (0, 10, 20 and 30% as partial replacement of cement) and after 28, 90 and 360 days of casting. The tigure also shows the refinement of the pore distribution with high, percentage of pozzolan

(30% as a pat1ial replacement of cement), and after longer time of casting.

3.1.2 Properties of concrete containing silica fume as supplementary cementing material

The addition of very fine particles to a concrete mixture tends to reduce segregation and bleeding tendencies. When very fine patiicles of silica fume (SF) are added to the concrete. the size of flow channels is greatly reduced because these particles are able to find their way into the empty spaces between two cement grains, causing high reduction in bleed-water flow channels and high reduction of the concrete penneability. Also. due to increase in the number of solid to solid contact point, the cohesiveness of the concrete mixture is greatly improved when SF is added (Mehta 1981). This makes the material highly attractive for use in shotcrete, and pumping.

Chapter 3

Several reports confimling the sensitivity of the concrete containing silica fume to plasticshrinkage cracking when exposed to drying conditions at an early age. Since concrete containing silica fume shows little or no bleeding, the rate of water evaporation from the surface of concrete is low and hence, a small amount of surface cracking occurs (Mehta 1981). This phenomenon generally occurs in hot weather (high ambient temperature, low humidity of the environment and windy conditions).

Creep of concrete can be defined 'as the increase in strain under a sustained stress. Creep of concrete is inversely proportional to its strength. Since the concrete containing S.F (as a supplementary cementing materials) is characterized by high strength. the creep for concrete containing S.F will be lower than that of the corresponding Portland cement concrete (Neville 1981).

If SF is used as a partial replacement of cement (10-15 %), there will be no deleterious effect on early strengths (i.e. I-day and 3-day strengths), and a noticeable strength increase is recorded during, the 3 to 28-days moist-curing period when most of the pozzolanic reaction takes place.

Many researchers investigated the penneability of concrete containing

~F

and concluded

that there is a significant effect on pemleability. For example, a concrete mixture containing 100 kg/m' portland cement. 20% SF, and a superplasticizer showed approximately the same pemleability as a concrete containing 250 kg/m~ pOIiland cement but no SF or plasticizer. The average value of the penneability coefficient of a plasticized concrete mixture containing 250 kg/m' cement but without SF was 615x I 0 5 m/sec, compared with 17.5x 105 m/sec when 10% SF was added to the concrete mixture (Cao and Sirivivatnanon, 1991). In addition to the large decrease in the penneability as a result of SF incorporation into concrete, a major reason for the improved resistance of concrete to acidic and sulfate waters is the reduction in the calcium hydroxide content of the cement paste. which decrease linearly with the amount of SF added.

Chapter :1

The alkali aggregate reaction is a reaction between the active silica constituents of the aggregate and the alkalis in cement, this reaction causes expansion and visible surface cracking (Neville 1981). The cracks resulted from the alkali aggregate reaction will cause fUliher deterioration of the concrete structure and will subject the reinforcing bars to con-osion activity. The SF concrete proved to reduce alkali-aggregate expansion. Since the amount of pozzolans needed for reducing the alkali-aggregate expansion depends on the reactivity of the pozzolans. many researchers have reported that 10% SF was found adequate to control the alkali aggregate expansion.

The ability of the concrete to protect embedded steel from cOITosion also depends on its electrical resistivity (Cao and Sirivivatnanon, 1991). As shown in Figure 3.2, increasing the addition of silica fume has increased the ohmic resistance of concrete substantially. For saturated concrete without SF, the resistivity is in the 5 to 10k-ohm cm range. With concrete containing 100 kglm cement, the resistivity was found to increase by 58% at 10% SF addition, and 190% with 20% addition. For concrete with 250-kglm~ cement, the increase in resistivity was 210 and 615% for 10% and 20% silica fume. respectively. For a rich concrete mixture (400 kg/m~ POliland cement content) that is typically recommended when a serious consideration has to be given to the steel cOITosion problem, the electrical resistivity was increased by 550% and 1600% for 10% and 20% SF addition to concrete. respectively. This increase in electrical resistivity was probably due to the pore refinement process caused by the pozzolanic reaction because the ionic mobility is expected to be low in a matrix. which has a fine structure.

Several researchers have studied the effect of silica fume on the steel-concrete bond strength (Gjorv et aLJ990, Khedr, and Abu-Zeid 1994. Aziz 1994). Gjorv et al (1990) studied the eflect of silica fume on the mechanical behavior of the bond between steel and concrete by using a pullout test (ASTM C 234 1991) on concrete of varying compressive strengths and varying contents of silica fume (0% to 16% by mass of cement). They concluded an improving effect on the pullout strength with the increasing additions of silica fume up to 16% by the weight of cement especially in the high compressive strength range of the concrete. They also concluded that the presence of silica fume affected the morphology and microstructure of the steel-cement paste transition zone, thereby reducing

both porosity and thickness of this zone. Similar results showing the superiority of the concrete-steel bond in silica fume concrete over that in ordinary Portlarid cement (OPC) concrete were obtained by Khedr and Abuzeid (1994).

Abadjiev et al (1993) studied the influence of silica fume on the bond between concrete and plain and defonned reinforcing bars by using pullout tests, using cubes made of concrete of similar compressive strengths both with and without the use of silica fume. They found that the use of silica fume resulted in an increase of more than 100% in the bond between the concrete matrix and plain reinforcement bars and an increase of between 9 and l7% in the bond between the concrete matrix and defonlled reinforcing bars.

This observed effect of silica fume can be attributed to several mechanisms: reduced accumulation of free water at the interface during casting, thereby increasing the contact zone between the concrete and sted, reduced preferential orientation of calcium hydroxide crystals at the steel-paste transition zone, and densitication of the transition zone due to pozzolanic reaction between calcium hydroxide and silica fume (Gjorv et al 1990).

Abdulaziz et al (1997) evaluated the effect of silica fume concrete on bond failure and the slip of the steel reinforcement; they compared silica fume concrete with ordinary Portland cement concrete. They concluded that the average ultimate pull-out load sustained by OPC concrete specimens before failure was less than that of ~ilica fume concrete.

3.2 Performance of bond for epoxy coated bars

Because one of the principal causes of deterioration in concrete structures is corrosion of steel reinforcement. Several manufacturers worldwide now supply reinforcement coated with a tough fusion-bonded epoxy to isolate bars from aggressive conditions. The sudace texture of the coating is smoother than the mill-scale finish of ordinary steel reinforcement. and alters the bond behavior of the bar. Many studies repO\i a reduction in

the bond strength of coated bars. although the amount of reduction varies widely. from zero to nearly 50 percent (Cairns and Abdul1ah 1994).

The reduction in bond strength of a coated bar relative to an uncoated bar is illustrated in Figure 3.3. Because of the loss of friction between the coated bar and the surrounding concrete, the only component of bond is the force perpendicular to the face of the rib. If the resistance to splitting of the concrete cover (the vertical component of the resultant bond force at the face of the rib) -is the same for either case, then the bar without friction wil1 have smal1er bond capacity than the bar that develops friction between the concrete and the bar rib.

Many researchers have attempted to evaluate the effect of rib geometry on the bond performance of coated and uncoated steel bar; Hamad (1995) evaluated the effect of bar parameters on the bond strength, he studied the change of ribs spacing, rib height. as well as rib angle and evaluated the optimum value for each variable. The results of this study shows that when the rib spacing and rib height for coated bar were kept constant (60 and

7.5 percent of the diameter of the bar respectively), the bond strength of the coated bar increased slightly as the rib face angle increased from 30 to 90 degrees. The stiffness of the load-slip curves of bars with angles of 60, 75, and 90 degrees was greater (less slip at a given load) than bars with angles of 30 and 45~ degrees. He also noted an increase in the bond strength ft)r an increase in the rib face angle from 30 to 60 for both coated and uncoated bars, while keeping the other parameter constant.

.

Another study was conducted by Cairns and Abdullah (1994) to investigate the effect of fusion-bonded epoxy-coated reinforcement (FBECR) on the bond strength focused on the bond slip behavior and the variation on the rib face angle. The bond tests were conducted using the RILEM pullout specimen, illustrated in Figure 3.4. A PVC sleeve covers the bar over half the embedded length at the loaded end to minimize the pattern restraint effects. The specimen was cast with the bar horizontal). The machined bars were coated by hand spray in the laboratories of a manufacturer of epoxy powders. The uncoated machined bars were heat treated to obtain a surface condition similar to that of ordinary hot-rolled bars. To verify that results from machined bars were applicable to rolled reinforcement, a hotrolled production bar was also included in the program.

The RILEM bond test specification reqUIres a medium workability concrete. The measured slump was in the range of 40 to 70 mm (1.6 to 2.75 in.). The specimens were loaded in a 10-ton capacity screw- driven testing machine. The Rate of loading was

around 7.5 kN/min (3.9 kip-force/min). The free-end slip was recorded throughout the test.

A plot of bond stress ratio, defined as the ratio of load can-ied by coated bars to that caJTied by un coated bars at a given slip (Fig. 3.5), shows the bond stress developed by coated bars to be initially 40 percent less than that of similar uncoated bars, but that the difference progressively reduces with increasing slip, and even reverses at slips in excess of 1.0 mm.

Another study of the bond resistance of epoxy-coated reinforce111ents was carried out in slab-type members at Purdue University by Cleary and Ramirez (1989). Tests were conducted on four series of specimens. The slabs were approx. 4 m long, 0.6 m wide, and 203 mm deep. Reinforcement consisted of three No.6 bars spliced at mid span. Splice lengths varied from 406 111m to 254 111m. The specimen's details are shown in Figure 3.8

Each series of beams was cast separately. The concrete compressive strength was 58 MPa for the 254 mm splice series, 28 MPa for the 305 111m splice series, and 39 MPa for the 356 mm and 406 111m splice series. The crack widths and the end and centerline detlections were measured at each load level.

A bond ratio of 0.95 was found in the 305 mm series with 28 MPa concrete. The 254

The average end deflections at a given load were only slightly larger for the specimens reinforced with epoxy-coated bars when compared to the specimens reinforced with uncoated bars. The specimens reinforced with epoxy-coated bars contained fewer, wider cracks than comparahle

3.3 PerfOl'mance of bond under corroded bars

3.3.1 Introduction

Corrosion affects bond strength, the slight fonnation of the corrOSIon product of a cOIToding bar at first increases radial stresses between the bar and the concrete and hence increases the frictional component of bond. However, further corrosion will lead to the development of longitudinal cracking and a reduction in the resistance to the bursting forces generated by the bond action. Some suggest that a finnly adherent layer of rust may contribute to an enhancement in- bond strength at early stages of corrosion, at more advanced stages of corrosion, weak and friable material between bar and concrete will cCI1ainly be at least pat1ially responsible for reductions in bond strength [Cabrera and Ghodussi ( 1992). Amleh and MIrza (1999), AI-Sulaimani et a] (1990)].

COITosion may reduce the height of the ribs of a defonned bar above the bar core. this is unlikely to be significant except at advanced stages of corrosion. Corrosion also may affect the rib facc angle in the advanced stage. moreover ribs of defolllled bars will eventually be lost due to corrosion.

3.3.2 Review of the previous work
Almusal1am, et al (1995) assessed the effect of different degrees of reinforcement cOITosion on bond degradation, they studied the free-end slip and the modes of failure in four degrees of corrosion (as a percentage of bar weight loss), as well as the effect of different crack widths and degradation of rib profile for the various degrees of cOITosion.

Chapter 3

The results indicated that. as the degree of corrosion increases from 0 to 4% (as a percentage of bar weight loss), the ultimate load increases fi·om 61 to 71 kN, whereas the cOITcsponding slip at the ultimate load decreases from 0.68 to 0.238 mm (Figure 3.9 to 3.11). The results also indicated a decrease in the ultimate bond strength with rib profile degradation (Fig. 3.12).

CHAPTER 4

MATERIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM
This chapter describes the experimental test programs, it also presented the types and propel1ies of the concrete mixtures used. A brief description of the types of the fresh and hardened concrete tests used to evaluate the concrete strength and durability is also presented. In addition, the details of the accelerated corrosion test are summarized. The compliance with several ASTM Standards with a brief description of the tests used is also introduced to ensure the highest level of perfonnance.

4.1 Experimental program

The experimental program was designed to study the bond strength for four different concrete types. with three different reinforcing steel types after subjecting them to several degrees of corrosion.

The four concrete types used were fly ash concrete mixture (0.32 w/cm), Silica fume concrete mixture (0.32 w/cm), nonnal Portland cement (NPC) concrete mixture (0.32 w/c), and high wlc concrete mixture (0.52). Three different steel: regular carbon steel bars, stainless steel bars. and epoxy coated bars were used to reinforce the 100 mm diameter by 200 mm height pullout specimen. each reinforced with a single symmetrical bar.

4.2 Conel·ete mix parameter

Twenty concrete cylinders (100 mm diameter and 200 mm height) for each concrete type were prepared to study the compressive strength and indirect tensile strength at ages of 2~ and 90 days.

Chapter 4

Different dosages of superplasticizer were added to the fly ash, silica fume. and NrC concrete (w/c = 0.:32) to obtain the same slump range for NrC concrete (w/c = 0.52). This technique was used in order to achieve the effect of introducing fly ash. silica fume. and the increase of w/c ratio. in the concrete mixtures without any other variables that might affect the mechanical propeJiies of the concrete.

The use of such silica fume and fly ash in concrete reqUIre a low w/c together with sufficient dosage of superplasticizer (to maintain adequate workability) to improve the durability and the strength of the concrete (Mehta 1981). For this reason a low w/c of 0.32 was used with each silica fume and fly ash concrete. To study the effect of addition of silica fume and fly ash as a SCM on the mechanical properties of the concrete. the same
w/c together with the same mixing proportions and materials were used with the NPC

concrete. On the other hand. to study the effect of high w/c on the mechanical propeJiies of the concrete and to study the effect of high w/c concrete in corrosion protection. a high w/c of 0.52 was used with the same mixing prop011ion and materials type.

The coarse aggregate used in this research is dolomite consists of two sizes, 20mm and 9mm maximum nominal sizes (mixed in ratio of 1: I). The ratio of the coarse aggregate to the fine aggregate was 3:2. The main properties of the used coarse and fine aggregate are shown in Tables 4.1 through 4.7

Ordinary Portland cement Type 10 was used in this investigation, which was produced by St. Lawrence Cement Company. A selected dosage of 375 kg/m- of cement was used in the four concrete mixtures. The chemical and physical properties of the selected cement are given in Tables 4.8 and 4.9

The silica fume used as a supplementary cementing material in this investigation. was supplied fl'om Grace Canada under the commercial name of" FORCE 10,000 0". It is under a chemical name of Condensed Amorphous Silica Fume. The chemical and physical propel1ies as provided by the company are listed in Table 4.12.

The poly-naphthalene sulfonic acid based superplasticizer was used tt)r low workability concrete mixtures. The superplasticizer was manufactured by Euclid Admixture Canada Inc. with commercial name "Eucon 37", continning to ASTM C 494 type F specifications. The physical and chemical characteristics provided by manufacturer are shown in Table 4.13

A synthetic type air-entraining admixture produced by Master Building was used in this investigation. The air-entraining admixture was used with different dosages in attempt to reach a concrete with 5-8% percentage of air per meter cube. The chemical family for this agent is Surfactant mixture, aqueous, and the physical and chemical characteristics are shown in Table 4.14

4.3 Reinforcing steel

Twenty M size reinforcing steel bars with a nominal diameter of 19.5 mm were used in this program. The regular carbon steel bars (uncoated and coated with epoxy) are manufactured locally and contonned to the ASTM Standard A615-72. The tensile test and chemical characteristics tor the stainless steel bars were obtained from Ontario Ministry of Transp011ation and are shown in Tables 4.15 and 4.16

4.4 Properties of the concrete mixture

The t)'esh and hardened concrete properties were investigated. Air content and slump tests were perfollned during the fresh concrete stage, while compressive strength as well as

Ten concrete cylinders (100 mm in diameter and 200 mm in height) for each concrete type were prepared, measured and tested (after 28 and 90 days of casting) in accordance with ASTM C496-96 as shown in Figure 4.1, and the splitting tensile strength (ft ) was calculated as follows

diameter and 200 mm in height) for each concrete type after 28 and 90 days of casting according to ASTM C39-86 using a 400 KN compressing testing machine. The results of the compressive strength test as well as the splitting tensile strength are presented in Table 4.18

4.5 Specimens preparation

In addition to the 80 concrete cylinders used to study the compressive strength and the indirect tensile strength, 27 cylindrical concrete specimens (100 mm diameter and 200 mm height reinforced axially with a single steel bar, and protruding at one end only) were prepared for each concrete type to study the bond strength under several corrosion stages.

The 27 concrete specImens for each concrete type were divided into three groups (9 specimens per group for each reinforcing steel type). Each group consist of: 3 specimens

tested for 0 cracking level and 2 specimens tested for each of pre-cracking, cracking, and severe c01Tosion levels.

The cylindrical concrete specImen has a pre-weighted No. 20 bar embedded and protruding at one end only (Fig. 4.2). The har is 300 mm protruded out of the surface and 160 111111 embedded in the hottom of the concrete cylinder

To protect the interface between 'the protruding steel bar and the surface of the concrete specimen from corrosion, 50 mm of the extension part of the bars along with another length of 25 mm within the specimen top, was epoxy-coated and taped with an electrical tape. For the specimens that have epoxy coated bars, it was sufficient to tape the hars with electrical tape without repainting with extra epoxy coating (Fig. 4.3)

To maintain the bar verticality during casting, a square wooden piece which had a centered hole of 21 mm in diameter, was mounted on the cylinder mold quickly after casting the concrete and the bar was then hammered until reaching the required depth (Fig. 4.4)

The concrete was mixed in a laboratory horizontal pan counter-CUJTent mixer for a total 6 minutes. The propeliies of the fresh concrete including the slump and air content were detennined immediately after the mixing according to relevant ASTM Standards. The concrete specimens were cast in a plastic moulds. All of the specimens were compacted on a vihrating table after casting. The specimens were covered and left in the casting room for 24 hours, then they were demoulded and cured in a standard moist curing room (at 2J±2° C and 100% relative humidity) to different stages, followed by pullout tests (Figure 4.5
and 4.6)

con'osion tests have been used successful1y to detel111ine the susceptibility of the reinforcing and other forms of structural steel to localized attacks such as pitting corrosion, stress corrosion and other fonTIs of corrosion.

The accelerated cOITosion test in this program was tenninated when the four stages of cOlTosion took place within the different steel types, based on the crack width; 0 cOITosion stage after three month of curing and before placing the specimens in the concrete tank. pre-cracking stage considered when the cutTent started to increases but before any crack was visible, cracking stage considered when the first crack appeared on the concrete specimen regardless the width of this crack, and severe cOITosion stage considered when any crack extended up to 4 mm.

4.6.1 Test set up

After the lOS pullout specimens were cast and cured, 72 specimens were subjected to

accelerate cotTosion by placing them in the accelerated cOtTosion tanks. while the rest of the 36 specimens (3 specimens per steel type per concrete type) served as the control specimens (0 cOlTosion stage) ..

The accelerated cOITosion setup consists of 150 x 50 cm plastic tank. electrolytic solution [5% sodium chloride (NaCI) by the weight of water] and a steel mesh placed bottom of the tank connected to a single steel bar. The specimens were placed

accelerated cOITosion tank and partially immersed with the electrolytic solution up to two third of its height. To eliminate any change in the concentration of the NaC 1 and pH of the solution. the electrolyte solution was changed on a weekly basis.

The single steel bar (connected to the bottom steel mesh) and the specimen bars were connected to electrical wires by clips then connected to 12 V power supply. The direction of the CUITent was atTanged so that the single steel bar served as cathode while the

specimen bars served as anodes. Figures 4-7 and 4-8 illustrate the schematic drawing of the accelerated cOITosion tank set-up and photograph taken during the test respectively. The CUlTent was measured in a daily basis by means of a SMART Digital Multimeter that read both the cun-ent and the voltage. The cun'ent readings were recorded after the readings were finally stabilized.

4.7 Pull out test

The pull out test was conducted in the Ministry of Transportation Laboratory using a specially designed loading frame with manually loading hydraulic jacks (Figure 4-9). After establishing the specified levels of con-osion. the specimen was removed from the accelerated cOlTosion tank and a standard pullout test was perfonned. In order to measure the slip of the upper part of the steel bar. one LVDT was attached to the steel bar and touching the lower steel plate to measure the relative displacement between the free end steel bar and the surface of the concrete specimen. The output from the LVDT and the testing machine was connected to a data logger, where the load and the slip readings were recorded at preset intervals.

4.8 Percentage of mass loss

A fter the completion of the pullout test, the specimens were broken and opened then the reinforcing bar, for each specimen was cleaned and scrubbed with a stiff nonmetal brush to ensure that the bar was free from any adhering con-osion products and then cleaned with a chemical agent according to the ASTM Standard G t -90 procedure. The mass loss of the steel reinforcing bar was then obtained as the difference between the mass of the corrodcd bar (after the removal of the loose corrosion products) and its mass hefore corTosion (Amleh 20(0) Percentage of weight loss

CHAPTERS TEST RESULTS

5.1 Introduction

The test results presented in this chapter are divided into three groups. The first group uses the CUlTcnt measuremcnts to study the effect of different concrete types and the different steel types on cOITosion initiation. The second group uses the pul10ut test to study the bond strength for different steel-concrete types, the study of the bond strength includes: uncorroded. pre-cracking, cracking, and severe con'osion stage. The third group shows the effect of cotTosion on the bond strength for different degrees of con'osion with the percentage loss of the bar weight and the bar rib profile.

The epoxy-coated bars exhibited a sudden increase in the current readings compared to the stainless steel bars and the regular carbon steel bars for the two tested concrete types NPC concretes (w/c = 0.52 and 0.32) (Fig. 5.3 and 5.6). The current readings of the cpoxycoated bars changed from an average value of 3.4 mA to a maximum of 490 mA within 5 days. and from an average value of 1.2 mA to a maximum of 350 mA within 6 days ""'jth NPC concrete (w/c
=

0.52), and NPC concrete (w/c = 0.32), respectively.

Chapter 5

The epoxy-coated bars showed the lowest CUlTent readings before cracking during the whole period of the immersion time compared to the stainless steel bars and the regular carbon steel bars. The cutTent readings of the epoxy-coated bars before cracking recorded an average value of 3.2, 1.3, 0.4, and 0.2 mA with NPC concrete (w/c concrete (w/c

= 0.52),

NPC

= 0.32), S.F concrete, and

F.A concrete respectively.

The stainless steel bars and the regular carbon steel bars showed similarity in reaching precracking. cracking. and severe corrosion stages. For both stainless steel bars and regular carbon steel bars, NPC concrete (w/c

= 0.52) recorded an average of 9,

17. and 19 days to

reach pre-cracking, cracking, and severe corrosion stages respectively. While NPC concrete (w/c = 0.32) recorded an average of 25, 28, and 39 days to reach pre-cracking, cracking, and severe corrosion stages respectively. Also for both stainless steel bars and regular carhon steel bars S.F concrete recorded an average of 56, 66, and 90 days to reach pre-cracking. cracking. and severe corrosion stages respectively while F.A concrete recorded an average of 56. 66, and 93 days to reach pre-cracking, cracking. and severe cotTosion stages respectively (Table 5.1).

The current readings for the stainless steel bars and regular carbon steel bars changed from an average value of 48 mA to a maximum value of 390 and 510 mA (tor stainless steel bars and regular carbon steel bars. respectively) within 13 days, and from an average value of 10 mA to a maximum value of 325 mA within average of 16 days when using NPC concrete (w/c

= 0.52) and, NPC concrete

(w/c

= 0.32) respectively (Fig. 5.3 and 5.6). On

the other hand. the CutTent readings for the same bars changed from an average value of 3.5 mA to a maximum value of 160 and 250 mA (for stainless steel bars and regular carbon steel bars. respectively) within 90 days, and from an average value of 1.6 mA to a maximum value of 134 mA within average of Q 1 days when using S.F concrete and. F.A concrete, respectively (Fig. 5.9 and 5.12).

The CUtTent passttlg through the stainless steel bars and the regular carbon steel bars stat1ed with a low level at an early age then rapidly increased after a certain time. The

cutTent recorded an average initial value of 50, 17,4.5, and 2.5 mA for stainless steel bars with NPC concrete (w/c
=

0.52), NPC concrete (w/c

=

0.32). S.F concrete, and F.A

concrete respectively, and an average initial value of 45, 17. 4, and 2.2 mA for regular carbon steel bars with NPC concrete (w/c = 0.52). NPC concrete (w/c = 0.32). S.F concrete, and F.A concrete respectively. The CutTent was rapidly increased because of the concrete cover cracking which left the steel bars without protection.

The current-immersion time relationship in most of the cases for the three different steel types showed an initial decrease in the current followed by sudden increase. The decrease of current for the first few days is an indication of the formation of the passive film around the reinforcing steel har. which protect the steel from corrosion complying witQ previous researches Cornet et al. (1968). The sudden increase in the CutTent was observed to coincide generally with the specimen cracking. In other words, the rate of corrosion of the steel bars was very slow at first until depassivation of the steel occurred when corrosion started, and then the rate of corrosion increased significantly.

For epoxy-coated bars only severe corrosion stage was recorded, since a sudden cracking was observed across the specimen passing through the embedded end of the bar (Fig.

5.13). this sudden cracking was due to cOlTosion concentration around the uncoated
embedded end of the 'har. The surface of the cross-sectional area of the embedded end was left uncoated after cutting the bar to the required length. Hence, the corrosion products accumulated and concentrated in a small area trying to occupy more space, which caused veltical expansion and exerted a tension force leading to separate the lower part of the concrete specimen fi'om the upper pmt at the embedded end of the bar.

The epoxy-coated bars embedded in NPC concretes (w/c = 0.52 and 0.32), were monitored for a maximum period of two months until severe corrosion occurred in all of the specimens. The results of the epoxy-coated bars embedded in S.F concrete and F.A concrete were not included in this research because the COiTosion did not occur for a period of more than 6 1110nths.

5.2.2 Effect of concrete types on current measurements and time-induced corrosion
Figures 5.14 through 5.20 show the relationship between the current in mA and the immersion time in days for regular carbon steel, epoxy-coated, and stainless steel bars. with thc four different concrete types [NPC concrete (w/c

= 0.52), NPC concrete

(w/c

=

0.32), S.F concrete. and F.A concrete] at different corrosion stages.

As expected. NPC concrete (w/c = 0.52) demonstrated the highest CUtTent values in the early stages of the test, approximately 48 mA with the regular carbon steel bars, 50 mA with the stainless steel bars, and 3.6 mA with the epoxy-coated bars, followed by NPC concrete (w/c = 0.32), approximately 20 mA with the regular carbon steel bars, IRmA with the stainless steel bars, and 1.8 mA with in the epoxy-coated bars. Silica fume concrete demonstrated lower initial current reading than both NPC concretes (w/c = 0.52 . and 0.32). approximately 4.5 mA with the regular carbon steel bars, and 5 mA with the stainless steel bars. but still higher than F.A concrete which showed the lowest initial current readings, approximately 2.5 mA with the regular carbon steel bars, and 2.6 mA with the stainless steel bars.

The initial lower current passing through the concrete specimens is an indication of the higher resistivity of the concrete. Penneability of the concrete is the main factor intluencing thc concrete resistivity. higher w/c ratio results in a higher peI111eability concrete than lower w/c ratio concrete. since the excess water in the concrete matrix occupies more voids (Neville 1981). On the other hand, the concrete with silica fume or tly ash as a supplementary cementing material exhibit lower penneability than the NPC concrete (Mehta 1981).

Supplementary cementing materials such as silica fume or fly ash improves the concentration of the hydration products, especially around aggregate patiicles and acts as the nucleation site for the calcium hydroxide crystals so it will be widely distributed in the

matrix rather than accumulating in water tilled pores and around the aggregates, also the pozzolanic reaction that results fi'om the supplementary cementing materials· produces calcium-silicate-hydrate gel, which is dense, so it can till more space for the same equal mass (Sarkar and Aitcin 1987, Berry and Molhotra 1987, Larbi 1993).

The maximum cun'ent reading cOlTesponding to severe con'osion stages in all steel types was higher in higher penneability concrete (NPC concrete (w/c = 0.52)) than less pemleability concrete (F.A and S.F concrete). The maximum current readings
=

corresponding to severe corrosion stage for NPC concrete (w/c

0.52) were 522 mA, 490

mA, and 380 mA for regular carbon steel bars, epoxy-coated bars, and stainless steel bars, respectively, while the maximum current readings corresponding to severe con"osion stage
t()f

Nrc concrete (w/c = 0.32) were 330 mA, 350 mA, and 320 mA for regular carbon

steel bars, epoxy-coated bars, and stainless steel bars, respectively. Also. the maximum CUlTent readings cOITesponding to severe cOlTosion stage for S.F concrete were 250 mA and 160 mA when using regular carbon steel
ba~s

and stainless steel bars respectively,

while the maximum current readings corresponding to severe corrosion stage for F.A concrete was 134 mA for both regular carbon and stainless steel bars (Fig. 5.14. 5.17 and 5.20).

Nonnal P0l1land cenient concrete with w/c ratio of 0.52 took 2 and 3 days to reach severe cOITosion stage from the pre-cracking stage when using regular carbon steel bars and stainless steel bars, respectively, while NPC concrete (w/c = 0.32) took 11 and 13 days to reach severe con"osion stage from pre-cracking stage for regular carbon steel bars and stainless steel bars, respectively. Also, S.F concrete took 22 and 25 days from the precracking stage to the severe corrosion stage when using regular carbon steel bars and stainless steel bars respectively, while F.A concrete took 25 and 29 days to reach severe cOlTosion stage fi"om pre-cracking stage when using regular carbon steel bars and stainless steel hars respectively. The improvement for using low w/c ratio in concrete was clear in using NPC concrete (w/c = 0.32), since it provides 4 to 5-times better corrosion protection than using Nrc concrete (w/c = 0.52). Also the improvement tor using supplementary

cementing materials in low wlc ratio concrete was clear in using F.A and S.F concretes. they provided an average of 2-times better COITosion protection than using NPC concrete
(w/c

= 0.32).

5.3 Pullout test results
The pull out test was perfonned using a specially designed loading frame with manually operated hydraulic jacks. After establishing the specified level of corrosion. the specimen was removed from the accelerated corrosion tank and the pullout test was pert<.mllcd. One LVDT was hooked between the top surface of the concrete specimen and the loaded end of the steel bar to measure the relative displacement between them. The bond stress was calculated by dividing the ultimate pullout force over the surface area of the embedded part of the bar. The displacement was plotted against the bond stress to demonstrate the relationship of bond stress-slip for different concrete types and different steel types for uncorroded specimens. The displacement was also plotted against bond stress for the cOIToded specimens to demonstrate the effect of different degrees of corrosion on bond strength. The percentage the of weight loss for the corroded bars as well as the degradation of the rib height was measured and recorded against the bond stress to demonstrate the effect of con·osion with different concrete types and different steel types on bond stress. Tables 5.2 to 5.5 present the results of the pullout test for the different steel-concrete types.

5.3.1 Bond stress-slip relationships for uncor.-oded specimens

The bond stress-slip relationships for the uncorroded bars (0 corrosion level) are evaluated for the different steel types (epoxy-coated bars. regular carbon steel bars. and stainless steel bars) and for different concrete types [NrC concrete (w/c = 0.52). NPC concrete (w/c

F.A with the different steel types (regular carbon steel, epoxy-coated, and stainless steel bars) at different corrosion stages.

As seen from the results, the el1oxy-coated bars show the lowest bond stress compared to the regular carbon steel bars and stainless steel bars for all concrete types. For example, the epoxy -coated bars show an average of 14.6 and 8.6 % less in bond stress than regular carbon steel bars and stainless steel bars respectively when using NPC concrete (w/c

=

0.52) (Fig 5.21). While they show an average of 22.3 and 7.4 % less in bond stress than regular carbon steel bars and stainless steel bars respectively when using F.A concrete (Fig 5.24).

The stainless steel bars demonstrated slightly higher bond stress than the epoxy-coated bars hut still lower than the regular carbon steel bars for all concrete types. The stainless steel bars show an average of 10 % less in bond stress than regular carbon steel bars when using normal POl1land cement concrete. while they show an average of 13 % less in bond stress than regular carbon steel bars when using concrete with supplementary cementing materials (F.A and S.F concrete)

Regular carbon steel bars showed less damage with no surface voids compared to stainless steel bars, also the ribs of the regular carbon stcel bars were slightly damaged (Fig. 5.28). The stainless steel bars were totally damaged after the severe corrosion stage, the bar surface showed lots of voids and no indication of the ribs as seen in Figure 5.29. The rust color for the stainless steel bars was dark black different than that of regular carbon steel rust color, which was brown:

5.3.2.2 Bond stress-slip relationship for different degrees of corrosion

The bond strengths for the regular carbon steel and stainless steel bars were evaluated in
each concrete type with four different degrees of con'osion (0 corrosion stage, pre-cracking

stagc. cracking stage, and severe corrosion stage). The results compared for the f()ur degrees of corrosion are based on the crack width;

a corrosion

stage stat1ed after three

months of curing and before placing the specimens in the corrosion tank, pre- cracking stage considered when the current stat1ed to increases hut before any cracking occulTed.

Cracking stage st311ed when the first crack occurs in the concrete specimen, and severe con'osion stage considered when any crack extended up to 4 mm. Table 5.2 to 5.5 present the results of the bond strength for each degree of corrosion for both regular carbon steel and stainless steel hars.

5.3.2.2.1 Effect of different deg.·ees of corrosion on bond strength

Figures 5.30 to 5.37 show the bond stress-slip relationship for different degrees of corrosion for regular carbon steel and stainless steel bars embedded in each concrete type. As seen from the tigures. in all concrete types and steel types the pre-cracking stage represented the highest hond strength than the other stages. For example when using F.A concrete with regular carhon steel bars (Fig. 5.36), the pre-cracking stage showed 4, 46, and 66% higher in hond strength than 0 corrosion, cracking, and severe corrosion stages respectively. Also when using S.F concrete with stainless steel bars (Fig. 5.35). the precracking stage showed t 6, 52. and 76% higher in hond strength than 0 con'osion, cracking. and severe cOlTosion stages respectively.

In all concrete types and steel types, 0 corrosion stage showed higher hond strength than hoth the cracking stage and the severe corrosion stage. and lower than the pre-cracking stage. For example it showed 2.5 and 7 times higher in bond strength than cracking and severe corrosion stages, respectively when using NPC concrete (w/c = 0.32) with regular carhon steel bars (Fig. 5.32). Also when using NPC concrete (w/c = 0.52) with stainless steel hars 0 cOlTosion stage showed 7 and \3 times higher in bond strength than cracking and sevcre con'osion stages, respectively (Fig. 5.31)

Cracking stage exhihited higher hond stress than severe cOITosion stage and lower bond stress than each 0 cOITosion and pre-cracking stage for all concrete types and steel types. For example it showed SO, 128, 16 and 17 % higher in bond strength than that of severe con'osion stage when using NPC concrete (w/c = 0.52), NPC concrete (w/c

= 0.32). S.F

concrete, and F.A concrete respectively with stainless steel bars (Figs 5.3 J, 5.33, 5.35 and 5.37). As mentioned earlier, tly ash concrete and S.F concrete showed one or two cracks. which stalied from the top of the concrete cylinder and extended approximately 50 mm down, leaving 110 mm ti'om the embedded bar contined with uncracked concrete. On the other hand. NrC concrete (w/c = 0.32) and Nrc concrete (w/c = 0.52) have the cracks cxtcnded up to the total length of the cmb~ddcd bar. For this reason. the bond strength for F.A and S.F concrete specimens was higher than NrC concrete (w/c
=

0.32) even at the severe

COlTosion stage. For example the bond strength for regular carbon steel bars in severe corrosion stage was 3.5 and 3.11 when using F.A and S.F respectively. while it was 1.11 and 0.61 when using Nrc concrete (w/c = 0.32) and Nrc concrete (w/c = 0.52) respectively.

In both regular carbon steel bars and stainless steel bars embedded in any concrete type. the pre-cracking stage exhibited slightly higher bond strength than 0 corrosion stage (as mentioned earlier). This result agrees with the previous researches (Maslehuddin et al 1990 and Amleh 2000). The initial rusty layer (occurs in the pre-cracking stage) that enveloping the bar surface, adds more cohesiveness and tj'iction with the sUlTounding concrete which definitely increases the bond strength.

5.3.2.2.2 Effect of steel type and concrete type on bond strength in diffel'ent degrees of corrosion

Figures 5.38 to 5.43 show the etfect of using regular carbon steel bar and stainless stcel bars with difterent concrete types in each corrosion stage. At the severe corrosion stagc and cracking stage (Fig. 5.40 to 5.43) for both regular carbon steel bars and stainless steel bars. F.A concrete exhibit the highest bond strength than the other used concrete [for example; 1.1. 3 and 6 times higher in bond strength than S.F concrete, NrC concrete (w/c

= 0.32). NrC concrete (w/c = 0.52). respectively when using regular carbon stcel hars at

0.32) and NPC concrete (w/c

0.52).

respectively when using regular carbon steel bars at severe corrosion stage(Fig. 5.42)] then
NPC concrete (w/c

= 0.32) which showed higher bond strength than NPC concrete (w/c =

0.52) [for example; 2 times higher in bond strength than NPC concrete (w/c = 0.52) when using regular carbon steel bars at severe corrosion stage(Fig. 5.42)].

At pre-cracking stage, for both regular carbon steel bars and stainless steel bars (Fig. 5.38 and 5.39). NPC concrete (w/c

= 0.32) shows the highest bond strength than

the other used

concrete [for example; 1.4, 1.5 and 1.2 times higher in bond strength than F.A concrete, S.F concrete and NPC concrete (w/c

= 0.52), respectively when using regular carbon steel

bars (Fig. 5.38)], followed by F.A concrete [for example; 1.1 and 1.3 times higher in bond strength than S.F concrete and NPC concrete (w/c = 0.52), respectively when using regular carbon steel bars (Fig. 5.38)] then .S.F concrete which showed higher bond strength than
NPC concrete (w/c
=

0.52) [for example; 1.2 times higher in bond strength than NrC

concrete (w/c

= 0.52) when using regular carbon steel bars (Fig. 5.38)].

In all concrete types, regular carbon steel bars show higher bond strength than stainless steel bars in all corrosion stages. For example at cracking stage for F.A concrete (Fig. 5.40 and 5AI): the regular carbon steel bars was 9 % higher in bond strength than the stainless steel bars. The ditference in the bond strength values between the two bars are more signiticant in 0 corrosion stage than that of the corroded stages. At

a corrosion stage the

effect of surface friction is considered between the two bars. while the corrosion products decrease the surface ti'iction for both of them as corrosion continues to take place.

5.3.3 Effect of mass loss on bond strength
The mass loss of the steel reinforcing bar was obtained as the difference between the mass of the corroded bar (after removal of the loose con'osion product) ti'om its mass before

cotTosion. The etl'ect of the different degrees of co),-osion (calculated as a percentage of mass loss) on the bond strength was calculated for each concrete and steel type. Figures 5.44 to 5.49 show the relationship between the bond strength in MPa and difterent degrees of corrosion (as a percentage of mass loss) for different concrete and steel types. the tigures demonstrate the relationship tor each concrete type with the regular carbon steel bars and stainless steel bars, and each steel type with the different concrete types. As seen from the figures. in all concrete and steel types, the bond strength increased with very small increase of the percentage of mass loss, [for example the bond strength increased by 6% and 9% with 0.34 and 0.71 percentage of mass loss when using regular carbon steel bars and stainless steel bars respectively with NPC concrete (w/c = 0.52) (Fig. 5.44)]. and then decreases with further increase of the mass loss [for example the bond strength decreased by 3.4 and 7.1 times with 3.75 and 4.49 percentage of mass loss when using regular carbon steel bars and stainless steel bars respectively with Nrc concrete (w/c = 0.52) (Fig. 5.44)]. The reason for the first -increase of the bond strength was the fomlation of a very thin rusty layer around the bar, which increases the concrete-steel friction. Furthellllore, with the increase in the COITosion products, a tj"iable layer fanned around the bar leading to a significant decrease of the bond strength due to the loss of the surface fl"iction and the degradation of the ribs height. Fly ash concrete and S.F concrete exhibited constant bond strength at high percentage of mass loss. these bond strength are considerably high compared to that of NrC concrete (w/c = 0.52) and NrC concrete (w/c = 0.32). for example with regular carbon steel bars. the bond strength at high percentage of mass loss was 3.5 and 2.7 MPa when using F.A and S.F concretes. respectively (Figs 5.46 and 5.47), while it was 1. J and 0.6 MPa when lIsing NrC concrete (w/c

= 0.32) and NPC concrete (w/c = 0.52) respectively with the same steel = 0.52 and 0.32) as

bars (Figs 5.44 and 5.45). The reason for that was related to the uncracked lower pm1 of the specimen which does not exists in both NrC concretes (w/c mention before.

5.3.4 Effect of loss of rib profile on bond strength
The ribs height were measured after the corrosion took place, and after cleaning the bars according to ASTM G 1-90, The rib profile loss of the steel reinforcing bar was obtained as the difference between rib height of the cOIl"oded bar (after removal of the loose corrosion product) ti-om its height bet()re corrosion. The effect of the rib height degradation for both F.A concrete and S.F concrete was not clear and could not be added to the charts, since the bars in their specimens con"oded from the top only within a small cracked section. Figures 5.50 to 5.53 show the relationship between the bond strength in MPa and different degrees of loss in rib profile for different concrete and steel types, the figures demonstrate the relationship for each concrete type with the regular carbon steel bars and stainless steel bars, and each steel type with the NPC concrete (w/c 0.52).

.

0.32) and NPC concrete (w/c

=

The relationship shows slight increase in the bond strength with a very small decrease of the rib profile loss, followed by a considerable decrease of the bond strength with the increase loss of the bar profile. For example the bond strength increased by 4 and 10 % with 9 and 9.5 percentage of rib profile loss. while it decreased by 47 and 152 % with 22 and 31 % of bar profile loss when using regular carbon steel bars and stainless steel bars respectively with NPC concrete (w/c = 0.32).

CHAPTER 6 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.1 Conclusions

·

A sudden cracking across· the concrete specimen was observed when testing the epoxy-coated bars with uncoated embedded end under the accelerated corrosion test. This sudden cracking resulted tl-om the concentrating of the corrosion products around the uncoated embedded end of the bar which caused vetiical expansion and exet1ed a tension force leading to separate the lower pati of the concrete specimen fl'om the upperpat1 at the embedded end of the bar.

·

Under the accelerated con'osion test, the epoxy-coated bars show the lowest current readings during the whole period of the immersion time (before the crnck initiation) compared to the stainless steel bars and the regular carbon stcel bars [3.2, 1.3, 0.4, and 0.2 mA average CutTent reading before crack initiation for NPC concrete (w/c

= 0.52), NPC concrete (w/c = 0.32). S.F concrete and F.A concrete].

Also the epoxy-coated hars exhihit a sudden increasc in the current reading compared to the other used steel bars for the two tested concrete types N PC concretes (w/c

= 0.52 and 0.32). The cun-ent readings of the epoxy-coated bars

changed froril an average value of 3.4 mA to a maximum of 490 mA within 5 days, and trom an average value of 1.2 mA to a maximum of 350 mA within 6 days with
Nrc concrete (w/c

= 0.52). and NPC concrete (w/c

=

0.32) respectively. The low

cUlTent reading of the epoxy-coated bars compared to the other used bars implies to the superior etlect of the coated bars in corrosion resistance. while the sudden increase of the epoxy-coated bars CutTent shows the seriousness of the concrete cracking due to the con-osion concentration in uncoated small area.

Both of the stainless steel bars and regular carbon steel bars reached pre-cracking. cracking, and severe corrosion stages around the same times [9. 17, and 19 days to reach pre-cracking, cracking. and severe corrosion stages respectively when using NrC concrete (w/c

cracking. and severe corrosion stages respectively when using NrC concrete (w/c

= 0.32)]. The time taken by both of the stainless steel bars and regular carbon steel
bars to reach sever corrosion stage w,as shorter than that of the epoxy-coated bars. This could be due to a higher resistivity of coated bars than the uncoated bars,

·

During monitoring the current reading for the three steel types under the accelerated cOlTosion test, an initial decrease in the current for sometimes followed by a sudden increase was observed. The initial current increase was an indication of the formation of the passive tilm around the reinforcing steel bar, which protect the steel from cotTosion. while the followed current decrease indicated to the steel depassivative resulted from the specimens cracking which lead to the increase in the corrosion rate [complying with the previous researches Cornet et al. (1968), AISulaimani et al (1990), Amleh and Mirza (1999), and others].

·

NOllnal Portland Cement concrete (w/c

= 0.52) showed the highest current reading

at the early age and at the severe corrosion stage [48, 50 and 3.6 mA with the regular carbon. stainless steel. and the epoxy-coated bars respectively in the initial current reading] during monitoring the CUtTent reading for the three steel types under the accelerated cOlTosion test, followed by NPC concrete (w/c = 0.32) [20. 18 and 1.8 mA with the regular carbon, stainless steel, and the epoxy-coated bars respectively in the initial current reading]. Also, S.F concrete showed lower initial current reading and lower severe corrosion current reading than both NPC concrete (w/c

= 0.52) and NPC concrete (w/c = 0.32) [4.5, 5 and 0.4 mA with the regular

carbon. stainless steel, and the epoxy-coated bars respectively in the initial CutTent reading] but still higher than F.A concrete which has the lowest initial and severe corrosion cUIl'ent reading [2.5, 2.6 and 0.2 mA with the regular carbon, stainless

The lower current reading in F.A and S.F concretes compared to that of NPC concretes (w/c = 0.32 and 0.52) signifies the beneficial effed in using supplementary cementing materials in concrete to protect the reinforcing bars fl'0111 corrosion. Also, the low current reading in NPC concrete (w/c = 0.52) compared to that of NrC concrete (w/c = 0.32) signities the beneticial effect in using low wlc ratio in concrete to protect the reinforcing bars from corrosion.

·

When testing the bond strength tbr the uncolTeded bars, the epoxy-coated bars showed the lowest bond strength compared to the regular carbon steel bars and stainless steel bars tbr all concrete types [For example, the epoxy -coated bars show an average of 14.6 and 8.6 % less in the bond stress than the regular carbon steel bars and the stainless steel bars respectively when using NrC concrete (w/c =

0.52)]. The stainless steel bars demonstrated higher bond strength than the epoxycoated bars but still lower than the regular cat:bon steel bars tbr all concrete types [For example, the stainless steel bars show an average of 7% less in the bond strength than the regular carbon steel bars when using NPC concrete (w/c = 0.52)]. This shows the preference in using the regular carbon steel bars than the stainless steel and the
epoxy~coated

bars in enhancing the concrete-steel bond strength.

·

When testing the bond strength t(.lr the uncolTeded bars. Nrc concrete (w/c = 0.32) showed the highest bond strength than the other used concretes t{)r all steel types: it showed 47, 79, and 82 % higher in bond strength than F.A, S.F, and NrC concrete
(w/c

= 0.52), respectively when using epoxy-coated bars. Also, it showed 35, 54,

and 84 % higher in hond strength than F.A, S.F, and NPC concrete (w/c

0.52),

respectively when using regular carbon steel bars. Meanwhile, when using stainless steel bars, NPC concrete (w/c = 0.32) showed 35, 45, and 66 % higher in bond strength than F.A, S.F, and NPC concrete (w/c

= 0.52), respectively. Fly ash

0.52). respectively when using epoxy-coated bars. Also, it showed 14, and 36 % higher in bond strength than S.F, and NPC concrete (w/c = 0.52), respectively when using regular carbon steel bars. Furthennore, when using stainless steel bars. F.A concrete showed 7, and 23 % higher in bond strength than S.F, and NPC concrete (w/c = 0.52). respectively. Silica fume concrete exhibited higher bond stress than NrC concrete (w/c = 0.52) for all steel types. Silica fume concrete showed 2, 19, and 15 % higher in bond strength than NrC concrete (w/c = 0.52) when using epoxy-coated bars, regular carbon steel bars, and stainless steel bars. respectively.

·

The use of supplementary cementing materials in concrete decrease the cracks number due to cOITosion. The cracks of the fly ash and silica fume concrete due to the corrosion of embedded bars were usually one or two cracks. while the cracks for both NPC concretes (w/c = 0.32 and 0.52) were between four to six cracks.

·

The effect of accelerated corrosion on the regular carbon steel bars was less than that on the stainless steel bars at the same COITosion stage. The regular carbon steel bars showed less damage with no surface voids compared to stainless steel bars. also. the ribs of the regular carbon steel bars were slightly damaged. On the other hand, the stainless steel bar surface was totally damaged after the severe cOITosion stage. with lots of voids and no indication ofthe ribs.

·

The bond strength in the pre-cracking stage is slightly higher than that in 0 corrosion stage for both regular carbon steel bars and stainless steel bars embedded in any concrete type (fIJI" example when using F.A concrete with regular carbon steel bars, the pre-cracking stage showed 4% higher in bond strength than 0 corrosion stage. Also. when using S.F concrete with stainless steel bars, the precracking stage showed 16% higher in bond strength than the 0 cOITosion stage). These results agree well with previous researches (Maslchuddin et al 199() and

Chapter (,

Amleh 2000). The initial rusty layer (occurs in the pre-cracking stage) that enveloping the bar surface. adds more cohesiveness and friction with the sUlTounding concrete which definitely increases the bond strength.

·

In all corrosion stages, the regular carbon steel bars showed higher bond strength than the stainless steel bars for all concrete types. For example at cracking stage for F.A concrete the regular carhon steel hars was ahout 9 % higher in hond strength than the stainless bars. The difference in the bond strength values between the two bars are more significant in 0 corrosion stage than that of the cOlToded stages. At 0 corrosion stage the eflect of surface friction is considered hetween the two hars. while the con·osion products decrease the surface friction for both of them as corrosion continues to take place. This demonstrate to the preference in using the regular carhon steel bars than the stainless steel in enhancing the concrete-steel bond strength even after several degrees of corrosion take place in the steel bar.

·

Although the F.A concrete showed less hond strength than NrC concrete (w/c

=

0.32), it is better to use fly ash in concrete to obtain the best concrete to protect the steel bars from corrosion.

6.2 Recommendations
· It is recommended for further investigation to measure the chloride ion content at the steel reinforcing level, this is because the percentage of the chloride ion content at the bar level indicates to the corrosion activity in the steel reinforcing.

·

It is recommended to measure the steel reinforcing tensile strength attcr the

corrosion takes place, the cOlTosion products could severely affect the steel reinforcing tensile strength due to the cOlTosion concentration in some areas.

·

It is highly recommended for fU1iher investigation to do more testing to calculate

the effective developing lengths for the regular carbon and stainless steel bars atter celiain degrees of corrosion takes places.
