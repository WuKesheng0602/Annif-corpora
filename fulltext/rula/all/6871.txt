ABSTRACT

There is a desire to push for innovation in the field of archaeology. Technologies like photogrammetry, point cloud scans, and additive printing are being utilized to document historical sites to cataloguing entire museum collections. The breadth of my research focuses on how Virtual Reality can be used as a tool to preserve the past and build new knowledge for our future. During this examination, questions arise around an object's authenticity, as Aura, and whether or not this is a transferable attribute from something with materiality to something with no physicality, such as a digital reconstruction.

Keywords: aura, presence, virtual reality, virtual archaeology, museum, additive printing

INTRODUCTION
Over the past two decades, I have had a hand in shaping the computer animation industry by training hundreds of future digital artists, as a Professor with Sheridan College's worldrenowned computer animation program. I consider myself forward-looking and quick to adapt to new technologies, approaches, and methodologies. Virtual reality (VR) re-surfaced five years ago when Palmer Luckey launched the Oculus campaign on Kickstarter. With it came the promise of VR being a viable tool for conveying ideas, stories, and knowledge from a unique new perspective.

How can an observer's presence in a digital environment be convincing, consuming, and believable to a point where new knowledge is created? The notion of developing this type of hyper-presence has drawn me to the field of digital archaeology. When I was approached to reconstruct the temple found in El-Hibeh, Egypt, I thought this would be an excellent opportunity to explore the immersive capabilities of the new medium from the point of view of a skilled digital craftsman.

LITERATURE

Not having a practical or digital background in archaeology, the majority of my reading focused on developments in these fields. Specifically, my literary review looked at the modernizing path

1

being taken in the field of archaeology, issues surrounding aura and its transferal to a digital form, and presence.

Virtual Archaeology Paul Reilly, a research scientist at the IBM UK Scientific Centre, introduced the archaeological community to the phrase Virtual Archaeology in his 1991 paper, Towards a Virtual Archeology;

What does the term virtual archaeology mean here? The key concept is virtual, an allusion to a model, a replica, the notion that something can act as a surrogate or replacement for an original. (Reilly, 1991, p. 133)

He wrote about the potential of three dimensional "terrain models" as a way of crunching large data sets, that field archeologists could use as a way of quickly testing hypothesis (Boismier & Reilly, 1988, p. 222). In his 1988 bulletin, Three-Dimensional Graphics at Sutton Hoo: A Preliminary investigation, Reilly began to see the value of using 3D artists to recreate lost information. He noted that it became clear that going through the process of creating a digital model allowed the archeologist to think more critically on how to fill in the gaps of missing information (Reilly, 1988, p. 24).

Adaptation of new technology was initially hampered by the skepticism of the community; this was in a large part due to lack of exposure and access (Reilly, 1996b, p. 39). Before the 1990s there were very few digital artists, software was highly technical (most lacking artist friendly

2

graphical user interfaces), and hardware was prohibitively expensive. Reilly states; "Until recently, the application and development of data visualization and computerized reconstruction methods in archaeology were restricted to a small group of researchers with access to research systems, often requiring considerable experience and training in programming of such systems" (1996a, p. 38). These issues prevented the less computer literate from seeing these emerging technologies future potential.

By the mid-1990s, around the period I entered the industry these issues had begun to dissipate. Competition in software development brought prices down. Computer Animation software companies like Alias, Softimage, and Side/FX tailored their interfaces and focused their toolsets towards artists. The purchase of Montreal based Softimage by Microsoft Corp. ushered in the use of inexpensive Windows powered personal computers, which went on to replace the costly Silicon Graphics machines. All these factors caused an explosion in production requiring a large number of trained, skilled digital artists. This talent initially gravitated to entertainment related industries, but eventually shifted towards fields, like biomedical, architecture, and archeology. Digital tools that evolved from the 1980's became artistic tools for digital craftsmen.

Aura Walter Benjamin used the word "Aura" to describe the uniqueness significant objects possess as a response to mechanical mass production at the turn of the19th century (1936, p218.. The idea of having a reproduction of a work of art, or a famous landmark allowed the public to be close to the object without having to travel half way around the world to witness it in person. They were, "bent towards overcoming the uniqueness of every reality by accepting its reproduction."

3

(Benjamin, 1936, p. 219). Benjamin considered an object's base materials, tools used to fashion it, the artist who crafted it, its cultural role, its location and who owned it to be the cumulative notion of aura? That the "uniqueness of a work of art is inseparable from its being imbedded in the fabric of tradition. However, this idea of `tradition" was malleable; he called it "thoroughly alive and extremely changeable" (Benjamin, 1936, p. 220).

Similarly, Jeffery (2015) suggested an object's narrative is what defined its significance. What was its path, its relevance, and its connection to the timeline? He described a connectedness to the past when being near a physical object of historical importance (Jeffery, 2015, p. 145). If objects were continually adapting, could their essence metamorphosize into a digital form? Could digital objects have aura? Because of the digital object's immateriality, Jeffrey (2015) suggested that inherently no. Digital reconstructs had no substance or physicality, no location, no degradation, they were infinitely reproducible, and could never truly be owned "only consumed under license" (Jeffrey, 2015, p. 146).

Jeffrey (2015) outlined a framework that could contribute to the transferal of Aura: 1. An object's aura could be reconstructed through co-production and the democratization of its digital construction, this "would facilitate the migration of, or creation of the aura." (p. 148) 2. Drawing on the craftsmanship of the artistic community (p. 150). Alice Watterson (2015) pondered why she believed this hasn't been the case so far," that the lack of theoretical discussion and absence of any sustained body of critical theory in this area may be attributed to the specialist knowledge required to produce visualizations,

4

especially in a digital medium where a certain level of technical ability is required." (p. 121) 3. The use of additive printing to make a physical version of a digital model could close the analog-digital-analog loop. If an object was given physicality it would bestow on it location, and allow for direct ownership'(Jeffrey, 2015, p. 149) Reilly (2014) also saw the "spirit" of Virtual Archeology continuing in additive technologies like 3D printing. He went on to state that since 3D printing had existed longer than Virtual Archeology it had already passed through the Gardner Hype Chart (2014, p. 125).

Presence While at a museum you would be in the presence of artifacts of historical significance. What historical figure might have held them or the craftsmanship and materiality of how and what they were made from all add to the object's authenticity, they had presence. Digitally, if you entered a virtual environment the quality of the immersion directly affects the observer's sense of presence, of being there (Slater & Wilbur, 1997). Traditionally the public had interacted and connected with the past through museums. Tilley and Shanks saw the museum's role as the bridge between archeology as a profession and the general public. The narratives these artifacts possessed are displayed, and communicated to the public giving them a glimpse of the past. They mentioned that the;

Notion of presence is at the heart of the 'romance' of archaeology. It forms the basis of much of archaeology's appeal and popularity [...] The objects have presence, human

5

presence - the features of the burial mask, the thumb-print on the pot. This presence constitutes the object's authority, its authenticity. The presence of the past - the past endures and reaches out to touch us. (Shanks & Tilley, 1987, p. 75).

Jeffrey (2015) described a visceral sense of the exhilaration, when holding a newly discovered object for the first time, "the thrill springs from that sense of proximity to people in the past that the object allows us to experience" (p. 147). Narratives of these objects also had the capability to elicit an emotional response. Dawson, Levy, and Lyons (2011) wrote about the shoes of a little girl that were on display at the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C, and how they embodied "the death of her dreams, those of her family, and the loss of future generations" (p. 390).

The story of the maker, as Andrea Witcomb (2010) wrote, can give a re-creation authenticity. She describes that the emotional story of Mr. Sztajer survival at the Treblinka Concentration Camp gives him the authority to re-create its model, "this model becomes a link to the past by virtue of the fact that someone's memory and lived experience is embodied within it and given material form" (p. 45). Similar to the role of the museum, Virtual Reality would provide a new way of contextualizing and connecting stories in a visual, but much more interactive way. Dawson, Levy, and Lyons (2011) documented two immersive projects: the Thule Whalebone house, and Igluryuaq of the Siglit-Inuvialuit. Regarding presence, they documented that, "these definitions suggest that feeling present in a virtual world or sensing the presence of virtual objects in the real world might also intensify feelings of being connected to an artifact or place" (p.391).

RESEARCH

History of El-Hibeh El-Hibeh was situated 150 km south of Cairo, along a limestone scarp, on the east bank of the Nile River. The site of El-Hibeh was first developed under Pinodjem I in the third Intermediate Period as a secondary residence for the Theban rulers (Arnold, 1999 p. 31). The town was politically situated on the northern border between Upper and Lower Egypt (Wenke, 1984, p. 7). Over the years the settlement transitioned from a large town to a fortified temple town (Wenke, 1984, p. 3). The temple (Figure 1) was dedicated to the god Amun Great of Roaring, by Sheshonq I (945-924) (Wenke, 1984, p. 7). Although smaller than a lot of similarly styled temples it was architecturally significant, being the first to have a screened pronaos1 (see Figure 2), and freestanding sanctuary (Arnold, 1999, p. 33).

A comprehensive excavation led by German Herman Ranke, occurred in 1913-1914 (Ranke, Abel, & Breith, 1926, p. 58). The collapsed rubble was cleared and sorted as well as glass plate photography being deployed to document the findings ((Ranke, Abel, & Breith, 1926, p. 59)). The photographs depicted the deteriorated state of the temple in great detail, and are currently available to the public through the Heidelberg Museum's website (http://heidicon.ub.uniheidelberg.de). The temple appears to have gone through various states of repair (see Figure 3) with pillars and columns seem to have been reinforced at some point with a lesser degree of craftsmanship than the original construction (Ranke, Abel, & Breith, 1926, p. 63).

This is consistent with the idea of objects always being in a state of transition that are part of an objects natural trajectory. These trajectories are undertaken so that the object can survive, its

8

essence can continue (Latour & Lowe, 2011). Elaine Sullivan refers to this as fluidity, "most `permanent' of structures, often in fact were quite fluid (2016, p.81). They were;

Modified, reconstructed, abandoned, resurrected, or incorporated into new contexts. Ancient people reinterpreted, amended, fabricated, forgot, and reinvented their meanings according to shifting cultural needs [...] such fluidities demonstrate that space cannot be separated from time for a nuanced examination of culture meaning. (Sullivan, 2016, p.81)

Paul Reilly also supports this idea of flux;

Objects and assemblages gather histories around themselves; they develop cultural biographies as they accumulate new significance, connections, and meaning [...] Their meaning and significance, however, is contingent on the web of relations and interactions in which these entities get caught up in. Meanings, therefore, can be renegotiated, even radically reset. In other words, they are always in progress. (2015, p.12).

The re-creation was to envision what the temple may have looked like earlier in its existence. In addition to the glass plate photography Ranke did do several site illustrations (see Figure 4 & 5). He documented the current state of the temple, as well as illustrating how he imagined what the temple would have looked like originally. According to Karl Breith, this interpretation seemed to have been inspired by aspects from the temples at Karnak and Dendera (1926).

Digital Tools I used several digital tools over the duration of the project. Modelling was primarily accomplished with Autodesk's Maya, which I had been using since its beta release in 1998. Maya was useful for creating lower resolution objects that I could bring into other software for detailing. Some of the more organic forms, such as the criosphinx and king statues were completed in Zbrush. The tools I used for texturing ran the gamut, from graphic tools like Adobe Photoshop and Autodesk Sketchbook, to Autodesk Mudbox, Allegorithmic's Substance 11

Painter and B2M. Substance Painter became the primary tool for creating the final look of all the textures used in the project. I grew to appreciate the way it packed roughness, metallic, and occlusion into one file, allowing for easier file management and organization.

Temple Version 1 I began preliminary construction during the months of March and April. During this period, I blocked in the main shapes of the temple using Ranke's illustrations as a guide (see Figure 6). I imported the front, top, and side illustrations depicting how Ranke envisioned the temple as image planes into Maya and scaled them to the proper size using the legend on the illustrations as a guide. The temple itself measures at 15.9m x 35m x approximately 8.6m. Dr. Jean Li, the current el-Hibeh site co-Director, completed a recent measurement of temple in July of 2017. Her values were very close to the ones recorded by Ranke. My lack of knowledge concerning Egyptian architecture was evident during the first version. The ceilings weren't properly positioned, cavetto cornice was misplaced throughout, the screen structures of the pronaos were too high, and I had built it as one seamless polygonal structure, which would end up making it difficult to texture. This original temple had to be completely rebuilt.

12

Figure 6. The early stages of the temple (Howald, 2017).

13

Temple Version 2 I decided to break the model into individual components that were grouped based on their location within the temple. All geometry and materials were given three letter prefixes based on which of these groups they were associated with. This gave me the ability to quickly find, select, or isolate elements across all the software I used. Photoshop was used to create comparative studies between Ranke's photographs and his site illustrations, to ensure block placement would be correct (see figure 7). Although the photographs were extremely high resolution, there was a lot of occluded information due to the angles from where they were taken. I found the illustrations to be fairly accurate, particularly when it came to the floor block placement.

Figure 7. Comparing the block placement between Ranke's illustrations and the photography (1914) http://heidicon.ub.uniheidelberg.de/BildsucheFrames?easydb=422dhc4t1f0oktaqrbehph80b4&ls=2&ts=1504139081.

I began by dividing the floors into four areas: the ramp, column hall, first pillar hall, second pillar hall, and sanctuary (see Figure 8). I planned on using one normal map for each section, but quickly realized that the bump detail would fall apart when viewed from shear angles. To create a more authentic feeling I decided to place each floor block by hand. This approach offered a 14

better realization of the subtleties of this element. Some blocks might be slightly raised, lowered, or angled depending on location in the temple (see Figure 9). They might be affected by how the foundation may have shifted, or the effects of local traffic walking on them over time. There was some evidence of this in the Heidelberg photographs. The central blocks entering the first pillar hall were slightly concave. These subtleties are a necessity to inject the feeling of use.

Figure 10. A textured view of the Sanctuary after using Substance Painter (Howald, 2017).

Although, it did cross my mind to build the temple walls in a similar fashion, I realized my schedule would not accommodate such a lengthy process. Instead, I decided to use a more 16

practical approach through the implementation of textures. I avoided using tiled textures throughout the temple. Tiled textures are convenient, because of their speed to quickly populate a surface. However, from my experience they act more as compositional filler, a time saver that could lessen the overall sense of craftsmanship. Sketchbook provided a robust set of draftsman tools that were perfect for creating the wall details, that I then brought into substance painter as bump base for generating the material (see Figure 10). The material itself underwent several iterations. My first attempt at a limestone ended being a looking too pink with odd ridging when scrutinized up close. Once I developed a material that worked I was able to apply it to every object with similar properties. Since the material is procedural2, it generated a unique texture for each piece of geometry it was applied to while maintaining a consistent look.

Found Artifacts of the Temple A variety of artifacts were found during Ranke's dig ( http://heidicon.ub.uniheidelberg.de/BildsucheFrames?easydb=k8ijjs43h13v9a3f2alni5osp7&ls=2&ts=1504206706). It was important to include as many of these items as I could within the timeframe available, however I freely chose which items to represent. The objects modeled included: two offering tables, a pot, a vessel, a censer, two king statues, and the barque3 - an object that wasn't found but may have been present in the sanctuary. Due to time constraints, I enlisted other digital artists to help with some of the models (See figure 10).

2 3

A procedural material is adaptive to the type of object it is applied to. The barque is a ceremonial boat that was used as a sacred form of transportation for the gods.

17

Figure 11. Censer modeled by Pooya Armaghan, (Howald, 2017).

Two statues were found in the first pillar hall (see Figure 12). Both statues were largely damaged. Statue one consisted of the hips, torso, and head. The right hand looks like it is holding an Ankh4, the left arm and legs are missing. The majority of the face was missing. There may have been an indication of a false beard but it was too difficult to tell. Statue two comprised of the hips and right leg. The belt and wrap are similar to statue one which led me to speculate that these statues were a pair. The overall height was a little difficult to judge; however, statue two was photographed angled near an archaeological yard-stick, surrounded by boot prints. Given this information, it seems that these would have been close to life five feet high.

The ankh is the Egyptian symbol of life.

Figure 12. On the left is the final modeled king statue (Howald, 2017). The statue was constructed from the found fragments during Ranke's 2014 excavation (top right) http://heidicon.ub.uniheidelberg.de/BildsucheFrames?easydb=422dhc4t1f0oktaqrbehph80b4&ls=2&ts=1

Dawson, Levy, and Lyons used placed artifacts in their Thule whalebone house as a way to create a narrative allowing a larger connection to be formed between the viewer and the environment (2011, p. 391). They utilized "nested" objects to evoke "phenomenological experiences" (Dawson et al., 2011, p.391). The whalebone house used static objects placed throughout the dwelling, but the Igluryuaq incorporated disembodied movements that depicted how the object would work within a "kinetic context." (Dawson et al., 2011, p. 393) This created an interesting disconnect, creating an effect where the artifacts seemed to be used by ghosts.

19

Digital Avatars The addition of inhabitants into the temple added a sense of spatial awareness. The ancient Egyptians were approximately five feet to five feet six inches in height (Ewen, 2015). Viewers would see these avatars and instantly grasp the scale of the environment. Aesthetically, I originally intended to treat the human element in a stylized and representational manner so that the focus would be on the clothing and surrounding environment. I found the anthropomorphic quality to be somewhat off-putting. This lead me to treat the priests in a slightly more realistic fashion. They were to resemble plastic store mannequins wearing realistic clothing. Not to be confused with real humans their skin would be fifty percent grey. This would also allow the viewer to focus more on the surroundings.

Sterling Castle in Scotland had employed a similar style to great success (see Figure 13). I created the initial sketches of the UAB priests from which a professional 3D artist used Zbrush to sculpt the humans, and Marvelous to generate the clothing. The characters were then brought into Maya where I rigged, posed, and prepped them for to the Unreal Engine (see Figures 14 and 15).

20

I looked to Sheridan College's SIRT facility at Pinewood Studios in Toronto to create some motion capture for the avatars. Regrettably, the scope of a detailed examination into "the other" including input from the Egyptian people was not achievable within the existing timeframe. However, there needed to be some thread of narrative. Mel Slater and Sylvia Wilbur stated that the "more the "plot" line potentially removes a person from everyday reality and presents an alternate self-contained world, the greater the chance for presence" (1997, p. 606). How can we build on the experiences demonstrated by Dawson, Levy, and Lyons? In addition to an environment that is meticulously crafted, a bridging narrative that ties all the elements together, additional senses beyond sight should also be addressed: sound, touch, and taste. Also, I believe that the world should feel lived in, and populated. 21

The Museum of Natural History, in New York, effectively uses dioramas to depict humans and animals in their habitat. Spitzer Hall of Human Origins has several displays that illustrate the evolution of humans (see figure 13). I decided to have two priests posed carrying out an aspect of their daily rituals. The specifics of these actions need to be planned out further with the possible introduction of a few more avatars.

One issue developed once the priests were placed within the unreal engine. It was mentioned that they were looking too Caucasian. Even though the skin material is 50% grey, the bounce light within the temple can be quite warm. This was giving the skin a warmer than intended appearance, and will require further investigation to insure the avatars are neutral in a natural way.

Figure 17. Lighting in the second pillar hall seems to have altered the perception of skin colour. (Howald, 2017)

The Surrounding Environment A basic environment was needed to ground the temple. Fortunately, the surrounding area had natural barriers on all four sides: the wall being the boundary to the north, east, and south, and the Nile river acting as the western boundary. This created a stage that appeared to be nested in a much larger world. At first, I considered having the environment become deconstructed further from the temple. Transitioning from detailed textures and modelling near the temple to grey 24

scale low polygon geometry closer to the wall would allow the focus to be the temple. However, much like the anthropomorphic avatars, this style could actually become a distraction. A colleague used a technique called blocking within in the 3D environment using recent El-Hibeh topological maps as a guide (see figure 17). The ground model was rebuilt two additional times. In the first attempt, I used Zbrush to add more detail closer to the temple, this ended up being too dense and could cause some issues with the game engine (see Figure 18). For the final version, I used Unreal Engine's landscape tools to build, texture, and add foliage (see Figure 19). There had been some discussion of the placement for the Nile river in relation to the temple. Today, according to Dr. Jean Li, the Nile is quite far the temple. Breith indicates in his writings that the river could have been much closer when he suggested that during flooding, the land around the temple and town would have appeared to have been an island ((Ranke, Abel, & Breith, 1926, p. 58)). Breith also points out that flooding could have led to the deterioration of the temples limestone cladding (Ranke, Abel, & Breith, 1926, p. 58). Regardless, I moved the river further away.

Sound and Touch Dr. Jean Li recorded some audio during their July expedition to El-Hibeh. It offered a good indication of the types of sounds that exist around the site today. I layered a few additional sounds as placeholders until higher quality 3D sound could be produced. This included the wind 26

blowing across the temple roof, and the sounds of the distant river flowing. Unreal has experimental audio tools for 3D sound that would allow for dynamic audio simulations. This could provide for a more immersive re-creation of the inner temple acoustics in a future version.

Over the last few days of the project I attempted to address touch. Unreal offers basic haptic feedback capabilities. If the viewer's motion controller comes in contact with a collision surface, the controller would rumble. I had implemented this in a separate file; however, time ran out before I could properly test this with the temple.

Virtual Reality and Unreal The majority of my personal work over the past twenty years has been building and animating characters, or crafting small-scale environments for short form television shows and advertising. Television content employs a lot of tricks or smoke and mirrors in an effort to focus on what the audience will see within any given frame. If a computer-generated element is off camera, out of the view of the individual watching, then it didn't need to exist. The level of detail an environment could have was less of a concern, because final images would typically go off to a render farm. A single frame would take anywhere from a few minutes to a day, or longer. Disney developed Hyperion, a 55,000-processor render farm to deal with these types of large scale renders (Seymour, 2014). Unlike a directed commercial, an individual in the virtual world can look and move anywhere within the environment. Render times are replaced with real time, virtual reality must run smoothly at 90 frames per second (Digital Trends Staff, 2016). To allow for this, a series of compromises and optimizations should be considered: how many polygons

27

are visible at any given moment, size and number of textures, the number and type of lights, the use of particle effects, and the amount of post processing.

I had been exposed to virtual reality earlier in the year as part of a small team building a virtual test environment to study hoarding.5 This experience gave me a fundamental grasp of what the potential for the medium could be, and a basic understanding of what was involved when it came to producing for it. The Unity game engine and the Oculus Rift were the main tools for this project. Even though I found the process rewarding, I wasn't particularly impressed with Unity's lighting capabilities and overall quality of the image. This lead me to search for other options. I decided to use the Unreal Engine for the software and the HTC Vive for the hardware. Epic, the developers of Unreal, had been actively pushing into VR which led me to believe there would be a greater degree of support.

Hardware consistency could become an issue. The specifications of the computer system could make the difference between a smooth immersive viewing to one that could induce VR sickness. Game engines use the power of the graphics card and rely very little on a computers CPU. The final week of testing the temple walkthrough took place at Ryerson's Collabrotory, a Library faculty research facility. Michael Carter took part in the first day of testing, and pointed out some significant frame drops, drops I didn't notice when working from my office. After doing some investigation, I realized that the graphics card in the Collaboratory's machine was the

Hannah McCabe-Bennett directed a study into memory and hording. I developed the VR Memory Test where participants had to remember which of a number of elements where organized within another aspect of the study.

Nvidia GTX 970, a mid-range card from the previous generation, which was older than the GTX 1080ti I used for the majority of the testing. This revelation led to additional optimizations, which succeeded in removing the dropped frame issue (see Figure 20).

Figure 21. Images of the final temple in the Unreal Engine (Howald, 2017)

29

Paradata A paradata blog, https://elhibeh.blog/, was created to document the temples construction (see Figure 21). In total, I compiled 14 posts (see Appendix). These largely consisted of screen grabs of the temple in its various states of construction, as well as images from various other sources, such as Adobe Stock. The blog was viewed 586 times by 124 unique visitors over the course five and a half months. The visitors originated from a variety of countries, including: Canada, France, the United States, United Kingdom, Belgium, China, Albania, Australia, Germany, and Ireland. My adoption of Twitter as a source for promotion happened later during the construction. Had I been more pro-active in reaching out to the Archaeology community the blog might have garnered more attention. To reach a larger audience in the future, I should post smaller blog articles, more frequently.

In addition to views it was an open forum for the archaeology field to post comments. During the five months, I had one comment. The comment, from Professor Carol Redmount, was particularly useful. It pointed me towards Arnold's book Temples of the Last Pharaohs (1999), which questioned when the construction of the Pronaos and Sanctuary occurred. Reaching a larger audience would hopefully increase this type of valuable input.

CONCLUSION

During the Masters of Digital Media Showcase, I observed the participants' behavior and found it interesting that in the virtual environment they would try navigating around objects as if the digital constructs were real. They wanted to interact with objects, however the virtual illusion would fall apart when viewers reached out to touch the digital models. Their efforts were hampered by the Swayze Effect6, as their virtual hands would pass through the geometry of the environment. Given more time, I would introduce a higher degree of interactivity. Imagine if the viewer had the ability to pick up and explore objects. This could heighten the connectedness to the environment, and elevate the overall experience.

Was a unique, authentic experience created in virtual reality? The temple, as a tool used to connect with the general public, offered the viewer an opportunity to participate with our ancient past. Similar to a museum's ability to let visitors stand in the presence of history, there was an observed enthusiasm when participants dawned the VR headset and travelled back in time to walk through the re-constructed halls of the temple. When all the components of modeling, placement of avatars, textures, materials, lighting, and audio are unified, an authentic experience was created.

Looking beyond the general public, what would be next? Could a phenomenological experience be developed, allowing the viewer to glimpse into the Ancient Egyptian mind? The possibility is there, but much more work would need to done first. It would be important to fully realize the environment. This should include colour, hieroglyphs, accurate representation of plants and animals, placed artifacts, a larger realized area around the temple including the town, and a fully animated population that takes into account ancient customs, rituals, and idiosyncrasies. All of these elements should to be created to the highest standards by a team of digital craftsmen, under the guidance of experts from the field of archeology.

Columns and Criosphinxes: https://elhibeh.blog/2017/05/17/columns-and-criosphinxes/ The month of May marked the beginning of full fledged construction. My plan was to work from the pronaus to the sancuary, then if time permitted add in the surrounding environmnet, digital avatars, and artifacts. I began by detailing the columns, and adding in the two criosphixes.

APPENDIX H
Texturing: https://elhibeh.blog/2017/06/27/texturing/ By mid-June I had laid out most of the UVs and was ready to start the texturing process. This process involved several types of software: Autodesk's Mudbox, Sketchbook, Pixologic's Zbrush, and gave me the opportunity to learn Allegorithmic's Substance Painter.
