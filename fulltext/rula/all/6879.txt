A Multirotor Vehicle Performance Prediction Method

Abstract
A method has been developed to predict the performance of small multirotor vehicles. Using the vehicle geometry, rotor geometry and ight conditions as inputs, the aerodynamic performance is found through an interpolation method using tabulated rotor performance data. The model is able to predict performance in hover and forward ight, and can produce results quickly and easily, making the prediction model a powerful tool. The vehicle performance prediction model also includes a wake interference model that captures the eect of rotors and their shed wakes on others rotors in the vicinity. When compared to ight test data, the method shows good agreement when predicting the angle of attack, rotational velocity and power requirements of the vehicle. The eect of the vehicle orientation on the performance of the vehicle was investigated showing that during fast forward ight, the vehicle requires about 5% less power in a diamond conguration than in a square conguration.

Introduction
1.1 Multirotor Small Unmanned Aerial Systems
Multirotor small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) have become increasingly relevant in recent years. Multirotor sUAS, like the Aeryon SkyRanger quadrotor in Fig.1.1a, are versatile systems used for reconnaissance missions, for example inspection of power lines, oil rigs and crop surveillance. These vehicles fall into the vertical take-o and landing (VTOL) category of unmanned aerial systems. Unlike xed wing UAVs, similar to the one pictured in Fig. 1.1b, multirotor sUAS can operate in both forward ight and hover.

unmanned aerial systems are desirable as they are also quieter and cheaper to operate than larger rotorcraft such as helicopters. The quadrotor conguration oers a popular and relatively simple approach to stability and control. Quadrotor vehicles operate by having four, in-plane rotors in a cross conguration. Figure 1.2 illustrates the operation of quadrotor vehicles. Rotors opposite to each other rotate the same direction, with the pairs of rotors operating in opposite directions. whole aects the movement of the vehicle. The rotational velocity of the rotors in pairs or as a

controlling these vehicles at hover and slow ight have made them very popular for many applications. For example, the ability to operate an sUAS easily appeals to everyday consumers who would use the vehicles recreationally, while their slow ight and ability to hover has made them popular for military purposes, and for use in the lm industry [3]. The controls, however, become signicantly more complicated at higher speeds and when performing maneuvers. The challenges at higher speeds are primarily due to the highly nonlinear aerodynamics of these vehicles.

Figure 1.2: Depiction of standard quadrotor conguration[4].

The growing interest in the further development of multirotor sUAS has been spurred by the advancement in the technology used to operate these vehicles and the miniaturization of sensors that use sUAS as platforms. Multirotor sUAS are operated by controllers that gather information from various sensors on board the vehicle, such as accelerometers and directional sensors. The control systems have 2

seen major development over the past years through the miniturization of sensors and actuators, which aid in the reduction of power requirements [5]. Improvements to the motors that power sUAS have

provided a decrease in cost, weight and packaging of the vehicles, allowing them to be further decreased in size [5]. As these advancements continue to decrease the cost and size of the vehicles, sUAS become more popular for dierent markets and their possible areas of application increase.

1.2 Multirotor sUAS Aerodynamics
The need for stable and controlled ight has lead to a large research focus on control systems of multirotor systems and less on aerodynamics [6]. Although control systems are a key component to controlled ight, it is essential to understand the aerodynamics of the vehicle as well. Bouabdallah has shown that rotor aerodynamics greatly aect motor control, as the forces and moments that are used in stability and control models can be directly attributed to the rotor[4]. In order to further expand the ight envelope of these systems, for example to y at increasingly higher speeds, better aerodynamic models need to be included in controller designs. Several factors complicate the analysis of the aerodynamics of multirotor sUAS. To begin, the size of the rotors used to produce thrust is much smaller than the conventional helicopter rotor with diameters usually ranging from 6-22 inches [7]. Small diameter rotors operate at lower Reynolds numbers typically from 30,000-300,000 based on the chord length at the

3 4 blade station [8], making scaling data from large

rotors unreliable due to missing data at the low Reynolds number range. Airfoil data is often unreliable and dicult to predict at low Reynolds numbers, as ow behaves highly nonlinear in this region[9]. Airfoil performance decreases as the Reynolds number decreases. As the Reynolds number decreases, there is a drop in the maximum section lift coecient, coecient,

clmax ,

and an increase in the minimum drag

cdmin [10].

A decrease in the

clmax

results in the blade section to stall earlier.

Another challenge arises from the wakes shed during the rotation of the blade. Young compared wake analysis methods and showed that the improper representation of the wake geometry causes the failure of most prediction models[11]. However, modelling these wakes in hover and forward ight proves to be a dicult task due to the complexity of the wakes, as there are many eects that occur simultaneously. For example, a multirotor vehicle requires rotors to operate in close proximity to one another. In Ref. [12], the eects of multirotor vehicles operating in close proximity to one another are explored. Micro

quadrotor vehicles were own in close formation in multiple scenarios, having them travel in either the same direction or in opposite directions. The scenarios showed neighbouring rotors can have positive and negative aects on each other, depending on whether they are in the downwash or upwash of another vehicle. Another issue arises in forward ight, as the wakes shed from the rotor plane are highly skewed. Both the rotors and their shed wakes induce a velocity in the ow eld and thus, may impact the performance of other rotors. In Ref.[13] a practical method for computing the velocities induced by a rotor is presented. Results show that the velocity induced by the rotor at a specic point is aected by the skew angle of the rotor wake. The skew angle of a wake, discussed in Sec. 3.4, is a function of the angle of attack, the thrust, forward ight velocity and the advance ratio, forward velocity,

Uneven blade loading also aects the shape of the wake, increasing the diculty of modelling. Blade loading increases near the tip of the rotor blade, increasing the vortex strength at the tip. As the wake propagates downward, the wake contracts and the tip vortex moves inward and close to the rotor plane. This results in an upwash eld that the next blade passes over [14]. Due to the uneven blade loading, the outside of the wake propagates downward faster than the inside, further complicating the geometry of the wake, as it becomes inclined to the rotor plane. This eect is depicted in Fig. 1.3. The assumption that the rotors used to propel these sUAS experience light loading allow for the assumption of a uniform helix shaped wake[15].

1.3 Aerodynamic Performance Analysis Methods
A major design challenge of sUAS is to minimize the power required for ight in order to maximize endurance for missions. Assessing the power requirements of a multirotor vehicle is not straight forward, as there are many variables that aect the overall power required for ight. Examples include the weight of the vehicle, ight velocity, altitude and the type of rotor used. be made when designing these vehicles. Tradeos between variables must

For example, the addition of battery packs will increase the

total power available. The additional weight of the battery, however, also increases the power required. Payloads such as cameras also add weight and drag to the vehicle, also aecting the overall power requirements of the vehicle. Currently there are dierent methods used to analyze the aerodynamic performance of multirotor sUAS. Computational uid dynamics (CFD) methods, which solve the Navier-Stokes equations for ow around the rotor blades, can be used to predict vehicle and rotor performance. In Ref.[16], a CFD

analysis was conducted on a helicopter scale model with focus on the main-rotor blades. The purpose of this study was to investigate the viability of CFD simulations with sUAS. The simulation showed good agreement with experimental data for hovering ight, with some diculties predicting performance in forward ight as moments in pitch and roll began to emerge. While CFD simulations may produce good predictions, the method tends to be computationally expensive and time consuming, and is not feasible

for the early stages of conceptual design, where it is necessary to solve multiple design congurations quickly. Furthermore, CFD only provides limited insight since it only generates integrated loads. The integrated loads developed using CFD make it dicult to identify the source of performance penalties, for example whether they are related to wake eects or due to conguration choices. As a rotor performance prediction method, the blade element momentum theory (BEMT) combines the blade element and momentum theory models of rotors and oers an approach that is computationally ecient, while still able to produce good predictions [17, 18, 19]. As the blade element momentum theory is only a rotor analysis tool, it must be used in conjunction with another model to produce vehicle performance predictions. Wind tunnel testing is another method used for analyzing the performance of multirotor sUAS. A project performed at the wind tunnel at NASA Ames Research Center tested a number of multirotor sUAS, measuring the full body vehicle forces and moments at various angles of attack and forward ight velocities[7]. The project was performed to address the lack of published data for the performance of sUAS, and showed that wind tunnel testing can be used to produce data for validating analytical and numerical models. While wind tunnel testing is a good method for measuring performance, it is not the most versatile performance prediction method as tunnel access is not readily available to most designers. In addition, this method would be expensive and time consuming if used in the preliminary design phase, as an existing prototype would need to be made. While wind tunnel testing can give an overall measure of the vehicle performance, it does not provide a detailed breakdown of the sources of the performance cost.

1.4 Contribution
In order to aid the design process of small multirotor vehicles and their rotors, a multirotor vehicle performance prediction method was developed. For known ight conditions, for example, hover or

vehicle orientation, and vehicle conguration parameters, the prediction model can be used to predict certain performance characteristics, such as the power and thrust required over the ight range. This thesis discusses in detail the vehicle performance prediction model and the components of the model. The prediction model is validated using ight-test data provided by Aeryon Labs Inc, a designer and manufacturer a sUAS based in Waterloo, Ontario. Finally, several design studies are presented in which

Mulitrotor Vehicle Performance
The term multirotor vehicle performance" used in this thesis refers to the power required,

Preq ,

of a

multirotor vehicle for a given ight condition. The power required for ight is an important metric, as the vehicle battery can supply only a limited amount of power. The power required limits the endurance of the vehicle, how long the vehicle can stay airborne. Identifying the factors that aect the power

required and including aerodynamic eects in the control system models that operate the vehicle will enable designers to improve the endurance and range of the vehicle, making them more appealing to consumers [20]. Understanding the contribution of the factors that aect the power required over a ight range is essential to making an accurate prediction of the performance, though it is a dicult task as there are dierent eects occurring simultaneously. Low speed Reynolds number eects increase the diculty of rotor performance prediction due to highly nonlinear behaviour of airow in this region. In addition, rotors operating in close proximity to each other complicates the problem of performance prediction, as rotors and their wakes inuence the performance of neighboring rotors. The forces that act on a multirotor vehicle during steady, horizontal ight are shown in Fig. 2.1. The angle of attack,

is the angle at which the vehicle is angled to the freestream velocity,

In the

work presented here, the angle of attack is considered positive when the freestream velocity impinges the reference line, here dene by the rotor plane, from above. The freestream velocity,

In this chapter, the equations of motion that govern the ight of multirotor sUAS are introduced and important performance metrics are discussed, in particular, exploring their relation to each other and the overall vehicle performance. The concept of the power required is also discussed in greater detail, decomposing the power required into its components and explain the factors that aect them.

2.1 Equations of Motion
Using the free-body diagram presented in Fig. 2.1, the equations of motion in the longitudinal plane can be derived by totaling the forces acting on the vehicle:

0 = Dpar + Px cos - T sin

(2.1)

0 = T cos + Px sin - W

Substituting in Eq. 2.1 and multiplying both sides by thrust, T, yields:

T Dpar + Px (W - Px sin) - T 2 sin = 0
Rearranging for

(2.4)

sin =

(2.5)

Rearranging Eq. 2.2 and using the angle of attack, thrust is:

T =
The normal force,

W - Px sin cos

(2.6)

Px , is a function of the angle of attack, though the value of the normal force is required

to nd the angle of attack in Eq. 2.5. This dependency results in the need for an iterative solution to evaluate the angle of attack and the thrust. This process is discussed in Section 3.1.

2.2 Multirotor Vehicle Thrust
Using the equations of motion, the variables that eect the overall vehicle thrust can be explored. Referring to Eq. 2.6, the dependency on the weight of the vehicle is shown. As the weight is increased, the required thrust is increased as well. Equation 2.1 can also be rearranged to describe the thrust,

showing the dependency on the parasitic drag:

T =

Dpar + Px cos sin

(2.7)

For an increase in the parasitic drag, there is an increase in the required thrust. By looking at what constitutes the parasitic drag, other variables that aect the required thrust become more apparent. The parasitic drag of the vehicle body can be expanded using the non-dimensional variable

CDo ,

as:

drag and the size of object matters with regards to that drag value. Furthermore, altitude, at which the 10

vehicle operates, also aects the drag of the vehicle. With an increase in the altitude, the air density,

,

decreases. This will result in a decrease in the parasitic drag if the other variables are kept constant.

Finally, an increase in the forward velocity of the sUAS will once again result in an increase in drag. It is important to understand the contribution of these variables as they not only aect the production of thrust, but the production of drag and thus, the power required. This is further explored in the following section.

2.3 Multirotor Vehicle Power
The power required of a multirotor vehicle can be expressed using a power decomposition:

Ptot = Prot + Ppar + Pind,int
where

(2.9)

Prot

is the power that is required to operate the rotor,

Ppar

is the parasitic power, which is related

to the drag of the fuselage and other extremities, and

Pind,int ,

which is the induced interference power.

Each of the components is discussed in detail in this section. To better predict the performance of a multirotor sUAS, it is important to understand how the components are aected by factors such as physical attributes of the vehicle and ight conditions. A power decomposition, where the total power required and its components are plotted over a range of velocities, can be performed to understand the performance of the vehicle and identify areas that can be improved. A power decomposition is shown in Fig. 2.2 for the example of the lead rotor of a sUAS with a The gure

is zero during hover, but increases approximately with the cube of the velocity (see Eq.

parasitic power, of which only one-fourth is shown, is directly attributed to the physical geometry of the vehicle as it is related to the drag of the body, landing gear and support arms. Therefore, variables such as the number of rotors used, and therefore, arm components required for mounting the rotors, aect the parasitic power.

Figure 2.2: Total power required and power decomposition for the lead rotor of a quadcopter in forward ight.

The interference power is due to several rotors being in close proximity, which actually reduces the total power required, because of the induced upwash eld. This is especially evident from 0 m/s to 5 m/s where the pure rotor power that is required to produce a desired thrust, is larger than the total power that is actually required. The negative interference power decreases the total power required, showing an assistance from the other rotors. The interference power is discussed more in detail in the following sections. At high speeds, the penalty of parasitic power results in a relatively steep increase in power required. This can be used to nd the optimal ight speed that maximizes ight range and endurance. With an evident dependency on the components of the power required across the ight regimes, the performance of multirotor vehicles can be improved with a better understanding of the contributions of each of the components. The following sections will introduce the components in detail.

2.3.1

Parasitic Power

Parasitic power is directly attributed to the aerodynamic form drag produced by the vehicle components, which are the body, rotor support arms, landing gear and any components not directly related to the rotors. Thus, the parasitic drag is the total drag of the sUAS, with the exception of any drag related to the rotors. The parasitic power can be expressed as:

Ppar = Dpar V
Referring to Eq.

(2.10)

2.8, the parasitic drag is proportional to the square of the freestream velocity. The

Therefore, the parasitic power, in a rst approximation, is proportional to the velocity cubed.

parasitic drag, composed of the skin friction drag and the pressure drag, is aected by the shape of the components and the surface quality. For example, more streamlined objects produce less pressure drag as ow separation is less likely to occur. Rough surfaces can cause ow to transition from laminar ow to turbulent ow, which may increase drag.

2.3.2

Rotor Power

The power that is required for a rotor to produce thrust, can be separated in prole power and the induced power:

Prot = Ppro + Pind
The prole power,

(2.11)

Ppro

is the power associated with the prole drag of the blade. The induced power, It is related to the self induced ow eld

Pind .

is related to the velocities that the rotor induces.

and is in contrast with the induced interference power, which is a result of the rotor interacting with rotors and their wakes in its vicinity. Both the induced power and prole power are directly attributed to the rotor and its geometry and are therefore aected by the type of rotor used for propulsion. In

Ref.[21], Gustafson compares the eect of the prole drag of helicopter rotors on the total power required, evaluating the performance of dierent rotor blades. The prole drag is aected by the sectional airfoil used for the rotor blade and its geometric characteristics. For example, Gustafson showed an increase in the thrust produced and a decrease in the power required for hovering ight when using a low-drag NACA 3-H-13.5 airfoil section, instead of the thicker proled NACA 23015 [21, 22]. Gustafson's studies show the importance of the rotor geometry as it can impact the production of thrust and the overall vehicle performance. The induced power is directly related to the production of thrust and the induced velocity,

The resulting component of the lift in the horizontal direction is the induced drag.

Figure 2.3: Eect of induced velocity on rotor airfoil section[23].

2.3.3

Interference Power

The interference power is the result of rotors and their wakes operating in close proximity and inuencing each other. The ring in Fig. 2.4 represents a rotor in hover. The prediction of the induced ow eld using the wake interference module is discussed in detail in Section 3.4. Note, the vectors are scaled to make the ow directions more easily noticeable. The direction and strength of the induced velocity vectors change with proximity to the rotor plane. These induced velocities have an inuence on neighbouring rotors. Rotors caught in a downwash require more power in order to produce a certain amount of thrust. In contrast, rotors located in a region of upwash require less power for the same amount of thrust. This component of the power required caused by the induced velocity of rotors in proximity is called the interference induced power,

Pind,int ,

and can be expressed as:

Pind,int = T vi,int
where

This eect can be seen when comparing rotors in a coaxial conguration, where the rotors are stacked one atop the other, to the single rotor conguration. Figure 2.5 shows the rotor power that

the two congurations require during forward ight versus the advance ratio as it is dened in Eq. 1.1 and referred to as

µ

in this gure.

For the same advance ratio, the coaxial conguration requires a

greater rotor power. In addition to the added drag due to additional components needed for the coaxial conguration, the interference between the two rotors and their wakes increases the power required by a factor of nearly three during hover.

ROTOR THRUST AND POWER

2.4 Rotor Thrust and Power
The production of thrust, the upward force produced by the rotor that is responsible for the propulsion of the vehicle, can be explained using classical momentum theory analysis. Shown in Fig. 2.6 is a

helicopter in axial ight [17]. In classical momentum theory, it is assumed that over the rotor disc, the velocity is constant and pressure is uniform. The ow is assumed to be incompressible.

From momentum theory:

T = mw 
where

(2.14)

w

is the downwash, the velocity of the far wake and

m 

is the mass ow rate through the rotor

blade. For a constant mass ow rate:

m  = Avi
The downwash is related to the induced velocity by:

w = 2vi

ROTOR THRUST AND POWER

Substituting Eq. 2.15 and Eq. 2.16 in Eq. 2.14, the thrust in hover is:

2 T = 2Avi

(2.17)

The rotor power is related to the thrust by the induced velocity:

3 P = T vi = 2Avi

(2.18)

The thrust and rotor power are in coecient form:

CT =

(2.19)

CP =
where

P n3 D5

(2.20)

n is the rotational velocity of the rotor blade and D

is the diameter of the blade. The performance

coecients are used to more easily compare rotors of dierent sizes or performance of rotors operating at dierent altitudes or rotational velocities. To more easily assess the performance of rotors, the

performance coecients are commonly plotted versus the advance ratio for a range of angle of attacks and rotational velocities. An example is shown in Fig. 2.7, which shows experimental data taken in the Ryerson University Large Subsonic Wind Tunnel. Two sets of data at rotational velocities of 3000 rpm, 4000 rpm and 5000 rpm are presented, for an angle of attack of 0 degrees. Referring to Fig. 2.7a, the thrust coecient increases as the advance ratio increases. Comparing the data sets between rotational velocities, it is shown that for the same advance ratio, the thrust coecient increases with the rotational velocity. In both Figs. 2.7a and 2.7b, we see that between rotational velocities, there is only a slight increase and decrease in the

ADVANCING/RETREATING BLADE

2.5 Advancing/Retreating Blade
During forward ight, the rotor blade of an sUAS experiences a nonuniform inow eld and, thus, uneven blade loading. This uneven velocity eld causes eects known as advancing and retreating blade eects. Figure 2.8, shows a rotor blade during forward ight. The azimuth angle,

,

is the angular position of

the rotor blade which is measured positively in the direction of rotation. The blade is advancing when traveling in the direction of ight and retreating when traveling opposite the direction of ight.

Diagrams of the velocity vectors of the advancing and retreating blade are shown in Fig. 2.9. On the advancing side, blade tip speed,

R,

and the forward ight speed,

V ,

are summed, while on the

retreating side, the blade tip speed is opposite to the forward ight speed, which results in a decrease in the horizontal component of the eective velocity,

Vef f .

On the retreating side, the eective velocity

vector is angled closer to the zero lift line (the dotted line in Fig. 2.9 ) than in the case of the advancing blade. Subsequently, the eective angle of attack, reduces the section lift component,

Figure 2.9: Flow diagrams for advancing and retreating blade conditions.

Due to the larger horizontal component when the blade is advancing than retreating, for the same induced velocity the angle of attack,

is larger for an advancing blade than a retreating blade. The

asymmetric loading creates a roll moment at

and

270 .

While some helicopter blades are articulated,

allowing them to ap, multirotor sUAS blades do not ap, though they do experience small plastic deformations. Performance measurements taken in the Ryerson University Large Subsonic Wind Tunnel measure the roll moment as a pitching moment since the rotors are mounted as propellers in the tunnel. The pitching (roll) moment,

M,

can be expressed in coecient form as:

CM =

M n2 D5

(2.21)

Although the proposed model is capable of predicting the pitching moment, a moment trim solution is not the focus of the herein discussed research. Therefore, the pitching moment is disregarded. The horizontal normal force present in the axis of rotation can be expressed in coecient form [18]:

forces acting on the propulsion system were investigated [24]. Figure 2.10 shows the aect on the angle of attack on the normal force coecient (referred to as

attack increases, the normal force steadily increases as well.

Multirotor Vehicle Performance Model
As part of the herein discussed research, a multirotor vehicle prediction method was developed using MATLAB. For known ight conditions, angle of attack and required thrust, the multirotor vehicle performance prediction model predicts performance metrics over the ight envelope. For example, for a known angle of attack and forward velocity of the vehicle, the power required and parasitic drag can be predicted. The vehicle performance model is a useful tool to aid in conceptual design as the geometrical aspects of the vehicle and physical conditions can be easily changed to study the eect on performance. In this chapter, the vehicle performance prediction model is discussed in detail.

3.1 Methodology
The vehicle performance model is composed of three subfunctions that evaluate the components of the total power required: the parasitic drag module, rotor performance module and the wake interference module. An overview of the workow of the model is shown in Fig. 3.1. Each of the subfunctions is discussed in detail in the following sections. The model inputs are the freestream ow conditions and the rotor and vehicle geometry, while the air density is calculated as a function of the vehicle's altitude. The outputs include the power required per rotor, the vehicle angle of attack and the rotational velocity and thrust required by each rotor. Overall, the program is organized in modules that are easily modied or exchanged in order to be able to respond to conguration changes.

Over a ight speed range the angle of attack, thrust, rotational velocity and power required per rotor are computed. For each velocity point, the vehicle performance model begins with the prediction of the parasitic drag and power using the ow conditions and the geometry of the vehicle components. In the rotor performance module, an iterative method which converges on the angle of attack is performed to evaluate the thrust, normal force, roll moment, rotational velocity and rotor power. In each iteration,

the thrust and angle of attack are used in an interpolation scheme of tabulated performance data to evaluate the performance variables. This process is discussed in Section 3.3.1. After a thrust has been determined during the previous iteration, the angle of attack is recomputed using Eq. 2.5 and compared with the value of the previous iteration step. calculated using Eq. 2.7. The next velocity point starting angle of attack and thrust are based on the values of the previous case. The special case is hover, where the angle of attack is zero and the thrust is equivalent to the With the rotor power evaluated, the next step in the workow model is the If convergence is not achieved, a new thrust value is

wake interference module. In this module, the induced interference power, the power produced by the interaction between a rotor and the wake it sheds as well as rotors in proximity, is evaluated for each rotor. Finally, the total power per rotor is then calculated using Eq. 2.9. Note, the total power is a

summation of the rotor power, parasitic power and the induced interference power, which may dier between rotors. Thus, the total power required is calculated per rotor. The eect of the interference power and the vehicle orientation on the vehicle performance is investigated in Sec. 5.3. The convention used for the vehicle orientation and rotor numbering system in the model is shown in Fig. 3.2, where the dotted line in the gures represents the line of symmetry.

PARASITIC DRAG MODULE

3.2 Parasitic Drag Module
In this section, the parasitic drag prediction module is introduced in detail, explaining the methods and any assumptions. As mentioned, parasitic drag is due to the drag of the fuselage, rotor support

arms, landing gear, and any other elements not directly related to the rotor. Results produced using the method are presented and compared to experimental wind tunnel data. Finally, an example is presented where the total drag of the Aeryon SkyRanger sUAS is predicted.

Drag Prediction Method

The parasitic drag and subsequent parasitic power are determined using an estimated approach by totaling the drag each component of the vehicle contributes. The complex shape of the components are decomposed into common shapes. For example for the Aeryon Skyranger shown in Fig. 3.3, the parasitic drag is estimated by adding the drag of the center body (A), rotor arms (B), and landing gear (C). The body is assumed as a sphere whereas the other components are approximated using cylinders.

Figure 3.3: Aeryon Skyranger with labeled components: A) centre body B) rotor arms C) landing gear[1].

The drag coecient versus the Reynolds number for smooth spheres and cylinders is shown in Fig. 3.4. The characteristic length, Reynolds number:

separation, resulting in longer attached ow and a decrease in the pressure drag[19].

This leads to

signicant reductions in drag coecients for cylinders (Fig. 3.4a) and spheres Fig. 3.4b) at Reynolds numbers greater about 300,000. Quantitatively, the drag coecient of a sphere is smaller than that of a cylinder. This is due to three dimensional relieving eects where ow can travel in additional directions over a sphere as compared to a cylinder where it can only move over or under the cylinder[23]. This decreases the stress on the ow and thus the drag.

(a) Circular cylinder.

(b) Sphere.
Figure 3.4: Drag coecient versus Reynolds number for sphere and cylinder[19].

To predict the parasitic drag, the ow conditions and characteristic length for each component are rst input into the model. Based on the geometry, the Reynolds number is calculated for the component. Then using the Reynolds number and interpolating with experimental drag coecient and Reynolds number data for cylinders and spheres, the parasitic drag coecient is determined. Although components may not be designed to be lifting surfaces, some may produce a lift force. In 26

turn, this production of lift results in an increase in the drag coecient of the component [19]. This increase in the drag coecient is the induced drag coecient and is expressed as:

CDi =

(CL )2 ARe

(3.2)

It is important to note that as the angle of attack increases the induced drag does as well. In addition, the induced drag is inversely related to the aspect ratio. An elliptical lift distribution is assumed thus, the span eciency is 1. The lift curve slope,

CL ,

is evaluated as[19]:

CL =

is assumed to be

coecient is the sum of the induced drag coecient and the parasitic drag coecient:

where the zero-lift drag coecient, induced drag coecient,

(3.4)

CDo ,

is based on the drag of a sphere according to Fig. 3.4 and the

CDi ,

on Eq. 3.2.

Finally, the total drag and total power are found using Eqs. 2.8 and 2.10, respectively. As the lift force, and thus the induced drag, is a second order eect, the lift and induced drag are not included in the model. Furthermore, a trim solution is not included in the current model.

Experimental Drag

Experimental performance data was collected for the body of the Aeryon Scout sUAS in the Ryerson University Large Subsonic Wind Tunnel as shown in Fig. 3.5. The body was mounted on a three degrees of freedom external balance used to measure lift, drag and the pitching moment of the body. Clearly visible in Fig. 3.5 are the two vertical pylons that connect to the external balance above the test section. Further visible in that gure are the rods that support the test object in the test section.

Figure 3.6a shows the lift and drag coecient of the body measured in the tunnel

tests. As expected, Fig. 3.6a shows the drag coecient increasing with both angle of attack and velocity. From Fig. 3.6b we see that the body acts as a lifting surface at some velocities at an angle of attack of 0 degrees, although only an insignicant amount of lift is produced. The body produces a downforce as the negative angle of attack and velocity increase.

Drag Model Validation

Figure 3.6a shows the comparison between the experimental and prediction result of the drag coecient with respect to angle of attack. The drag The Reynolds numbers are based on the body diameter of 18cm. For lower velocities and angles of attack, the prediction model ts the experimental results quite well. As the velocity increases, the drag model strays from the experimental results. This is a result of the zero-lift drag,

The parasitic drag is proportional to the square of the airspeed, while the parasitic power has a cubic relationship to the airspeed. Therefore, parasitic drag must be considered when designing sUAS as its inuence increases with the number of components added to the vehicle.

3.3 Rotor Module
As indicated in Fig. 3.1, the power that is needed to produce a certain amount of thrust with a rotor is determined using the rotor performance module. Tabulated rotor performance data is used in a table lookup routine. The tabulated data can be based on experimental results, for example from wind-tunnel tests, or on theoretical predictions, for example as done by Carroll [25]. The table lookup method for evaluating the rotor power is introduced in this section, while the tables used to produce results in this thesis are presented in Appendix B. The prediction and experimental methods used to populate the rotor performance tables, as well as the wind tunnel and testing apparatus are discussed in detail in Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3.

3.3.1

Table Lookup Method

The rotor power is found through interpolation of table rotor performance data that is derived either experimentally or using a rotor-performance prediction code, for example as done by Carroll [25]. For a given inow angle, the data is grouped by rotational speeds of the rotor. For each rotational speed, the rotor loads are listed for increasing dynamic pressures. The rotor loads include thrust per density,

3.7 shows an example of the tabulated thrust per density data for an inow angle of 0 degrees (freestream parallel to rotor disc) as it is used for the thrust interpolation. In place of thrust and velocity as querying variables for the interpolation scheme, the thrust per density and the dynamic pressure are used in order to easier accommodate for simulations of dierent altitudes.

Figure 3.7: Dynamic pressure versus thrust per density for a rotor at 0 degrees angle of attack.

For a known angle of attack, the dynamic pressure, thrust per density, power coecient, normal force and rotational velocity are found through a three step interpolation method. The algorithm for the multiple interpolation method is shown in Fig. 3.8. The method begins with the required thrust, angle of attack and density as inputs. As the tables are specic to the angle of attack at which the data was collected, the complete interpolation method is performed on the tables bounding the known angle of attack, resulting in two values for each of the performance variables; one set for the upper bounding table and one for the lower. An example of rotational velocity curves for a rotor at 0 degrees angle of attack is shown in Fig. 3.7. In a rst approximation, thrust and rotational speed of the rotor have a quadratic relationship (see Eq. 2.19). Therefore, three data points are used to make a quadratic t. For that purpose, the curves of the three rotational velocity curves that are closest to the query point are selected for the interpolation 32

method. In the example of Fig. 3.7, the values of 3000, 4000, and 5000 RPM are used for the quadratic interpolation. Using the known thrust per density, the rotational velocity is found using the following:

T T  = A( ) 2 + B + C  

(3.7)

With the rotational velocity known, the advance ratio, power coecient and normal force per density can be found through interpolation. Using the example presented in Fig. 3.7, three power coecients that correspond to the thrust per density and dynamic pressure at 3000, 4000 and 5000 RPM are selected from the table. Using the known rotational velocity, the three query rotational velocities and three query power coecients, an interpolation is performed to nd the resultant power coecient. As there is a cubic relationship between

CP

and

n

as seen in Eq.

2.20, a cubic interpolation is performed.

At the state of this writing, the experimental apparatus used to measure the performance data is not equipped to measure the normal force. Thus, the normal force is calculated using a rotor prediction code as part of the post processing procedure. The two sources will be discussed in the following sections.

The rotor performance prediction method is based on blade element momentum theory (BEMT) and uses a rotor blade that is discretized into elements across its radius, analyzed at each element and integrated to predict overall rotor performance. In Fig. 3.9, the sectional forces and angles of a two dimensional rotor cross section are shown. The dashed line is the zero lift line, where helix angle.

The prediction model uses the wake interference model presented in Section 3.4 to predict interference induced velocities created by shed wakes and rotors in the vicinity. Finally, integrating Eqs. 3.9 and 3.10 and reducing to coecient

forms results in the standard performance equations. The normal force is calculated by integrating the 35

Using the blade element momentum theory prediction model, performance data was produced for a Master Airscrew 11x7 rotor. Figures 3.10 and 3.11 show performance data for the rotor at 0 degrees and 30 degrees respectively. Looking at the thrust coecient versus the advance ratio in Fig. 3.10a, the curves for each rotational velocity lay close to each other showing low dependency on the rotational velocity. As the angle of attack increases, the thrust coecient decreases for the same advance ratio

and rotational velocity. Small performance dierences can be observed between the dierent rotational speeds. These dierences are related to Reynolds number eects [25].

Experimental Rotor Performance

In addition to the theoretical predictions, propeller performance experiments were conducted using the Ryerson University Large Subsonic Wind Tunnel. This section discusses the wind tunnel experiments. The data reduction method is discussed, including any sources of error.

Wind Tunnel

Figure 3.12 presents a drawing of the closed circuit wind tunnel.

The tunnel has a test section that

measures 0.9 m by 0.9 m, 1.5 m long. Screens are placed ahead of the contraction zone of the tunnel to assist ow quality control. Turning vanes assist the ow at each corner. The freestream velocity can reach a maximum of approximately 67 m/s. The performance tables used in the herein presented study consists of data taken at speeds from 0 m/s to approximately 20 m/s.

Recent improvements to the tunnel included the replacement of the fan assembly as well as an investigation of the ow quality of the tunnel. A fan nacelle and streamline device seen in the fan

Rotor Test Stand

A propeller test stand was designed, manufactured and mounted in the wind tunnel to collect rotor performance data, such as thrust, torque, and pitching moment (due to advancing/retreating blade eects). The test stand is mounted on a turn table in order to test with oblique inow angles. The

chosen angle of attack convention is shown in Fig. 3.13. At 90 degrees the rotor axis is facing into the free stream, thus the rotor acts as a conventional propeller. An orientation of 0 degrees is fully edgewise ow with the free stream parallel to the rotor plane. The test stand, displayed in Fig. 3.14, is equipped with three load cells to measure thrust, torque and pitching loads developed by the rotor. Note, the pitching moment manifests itself in a roll moment for a multi-rotor vehicle. The rotational speed is

measured using an infrared sensor that measures the time between blade passes.

The dynamic pressure in the test section is measured using the static pressure drop across the contraction zone upstream of the test section. Air density is calculated for each data point using the present conditions in the test section. Atmospheric pressure is measured using a laboratory barometer while the wind tunnel air temperature is measured using a thermocouple. The data acquisition is

performed using a LabJack T7 data acquisition device equipped with a LabJack CB37 terminal board. The terminal board is used to connect the sensors to the data acquisition system. A detailed description of the experimental procedure can be found in Appendix A.2.

This is likely due to the under prediction of section drag coecients.

3.4 Wake Interference Module
The wake interference module captures the eect of the wakes shed by the rotating blades in single and multiple rotor congurations. The rotor and its wakes are modelled using a series of vortex rings. An example of this model can be seen in Fig. 3.16 where the ring at the top of the series of rings represents the rotor, while the subsequent rings represent the shed wakes.

Figure 3.16: Vortex rings representing a series of wakes shed by rotor.

42

CHAPTER 3.

VEHICLE PERFORMANCE MODEL

3.4.

WAKE INTERFERENCE MODULE

For an arbitrary point, the model is able to calculate the velocity induced by the rotor blades and the velocity induced by the wakes shed from the rotor. The total induced velocity at that point, is a summation of the velocity induced by the rotor and the velocity induced by the shed wakes. The rotor and rotor wakes are composed of multiple vortex line segments. Each vortex line segment has a circulation which is assumed to be constant across the rotor. Using the Kutta-Joukowski theorem and assuming constant circulation across the blade, the circulation per rotor blade is [28]:

=

T R2 nB

(3.13)

As this is the circulation of one rotor, the thrust used to evaluate the circulation is the thrust produced by one rotor. Using the Biot-Savart rule, the velocity induced at point P by the segment is found as a summation of the velocities calculated for each segment in the vortex ring[29]. As the rotor blades advance, wakes are produced and shed from the rotor plane. These wakes are modeled as vortex rings in planes oset from and parallel to the rotor plane. A wake is shed when a rotor blade completes on full revolution. The time it takes for a rotation to be completed can be expressed as the circumference of the disc area divided by the rotational velocity:

t=

Simplifying:

When a forward velocity is present, the wakes are skewed at angle



as they are shed from the rotor

plane. The skew angle, pictured in Fig. 3.17, is measured from the vertical,

axis, to the center line

of the skewed wake and can be calculated as a function of the forward velocity and the vehicle angle of attack as [13]:

-V cos V sin - w

(3.18)

Figure 3.17: Geometry of skewed wake.

To validate the results of the interference model, the induced velocities calculated were compared to analytical results published by Castles and De Leeuw, who found the induced velocity in the ow eld is found through numerical integration of complete elliptic integrals[13]. For example, Fig.3.18 shows the normalized induced velocity along the rotor plane for skew angles of 0, 26.56 and 45 degrees comparing the results of the wake interference model and Ref.[13]. For both cases, the rotor radius was set to unity. The induced velocity at each radial section is normalized by the induced velocity at the center of the rotor. The number of rotor segments used per wake segment,

j,

and the number of wake rings used,

k,

are varied to evaluate the least number of vortex segments per vortex ring and vortex rings are needed to result in a valid solution. This is an important study, as there is a tradeo between computational speed and accuracy. As j and k are increased, the accuracy of the solution increases, however, the

44

CHAPTER 3.

VEHICLE PERFORMANCE MODEL

WAKE INTERFERENCE MODULE

computational eort increases, resulting in a longer solution time. In order to nd a computationally ecient and accurate combination of the number of segments per wake ring and the number of wake rings, a sensitivity study was performed and is summarized in Fig. 3.18. Referring to Fig. 3.18a the number of rotor segments used is set to 100 segments and 200 segments, while the number of wake rings used is set to 0 in order to evaluate the eect of the number of segments for each vortex ring. It can be seen that without the inclusion of wakes, the solution does not t the published results. In addition, there is little dierence in the solution between the two cases in Fig. 3.18a, as compared to the plots in Figs. 3.18b-d, where the number of wake rings that were used is compared. In order to achieve good agreement with Castles and De Leeuw[13], a large number of vortex rings has a greater impact than the number of vortex segments that constitute a vortex ring. Figures 3.18 b-d show that as the number of wake rings that were used is increased from 100 to 400, the solution converges. When the number of wakes is set to 400, good agreement exists with the analytical results of Ref. [13]. There is a loss in resolution, especially in regions just left and right of the tip of the rotor, as the skew angle increases, although other regions along the rotor plane show good agreement. Referring to Table 3.4, the solution time in seconds for studies shown in Figs. 3.18 b-d

are shown. For each angle of attack, the dierence in solution time between using 300 wakes and 400 wakes is only about one second, meaning that the penalty for better accuracy is minimal. The times are based on predictions found on a personal computer using an Intel core i7 processor. As a result of the validation study, the number of wakes used in the model is set to 400, while the number of vortex segments per ring is set to 100.

Interference power is dependent on the relative proximity and location of the rotors to each other, therefore, the orientation of the rotors in the system with respect to each other and with respect to the direction of ight is important.

Multirotor Vehicle Performance Model Validation
To determine the proper functioning of the model, predicted performance data was compared to ighttest data provided by Aeryon Labs Inc. their SkyRanger model. in Waterloo, Ontario. Aeryon provided ight-test data for The data were collected over a series of ights by the onboard sensors and

processed in order to compare it to the predicted results. The ight-test data were provided without environmental data, for example wind speed and direction, and therefore required ltering to achieve a better comparison. As a method of determining the proper functioning of the model, predicted values of the rotational velocity, power required per rotor and vehicle angle of attack over a ight-speed range were compared to ight-test data. The ight-test data position, pitch angle, acceleration and airspeed are measured as a combination of GPS data and accelerometer data. The ight-test data power per rotor is a measure of how much power is drawn from the battery, while the rotational velocity per rotor is provided by the electronic speed controller. The ight-test data was ltered with the purpose of removing errors and eects that are not present in the prediction model. For example, the prediction model assumes there is no acceleration present To replicate steady state motion in the ight-test data, data points with

m/s was allowed for the ight-test data airspeed.

Predicted results were obtained for a model of the Aeryon SkyRanger using experimental ASP130 rotor performance data at an altitude of 346 m. As discussed, lowering the allowable forward ight

acceleration trimmed the ight-test data, removing non steady state data points from comparison. A trend in the ight-test data is present in Fig. 4.1 where a comparison of the predicted and measured vehicle angle of attack in degrees is shown. The model captures the trend of the ight-test data as the pitch angle increases with the velocity. An under prediction in the parasitic drag, as the components geometry was simplied to common shapes, can account for the low under prediction in the angle of attack.

In the following section, case studies consisting of performance predictions using the model are presented.

51

Chapter 5

Case Studies
A number of case studies are presented in the following subsections consisting of performance predictions created using the program described in Chapter 3. Each of the studies highlight a component of the power required and explores its contribution to the overall vehicle performance. In turn, the functionality and exibility of the vehicle performance model as a design tool is demonstrated, as well as the utility of power decomposition methods.

5.1 Eect of Altitude
The performance of an Aeryon SkyRanger quadrotor equipped with T-Motor 18 by 6.1 inch rotor was predicted using the aforementioned prediction model. The power decomposition of a four rotor vehicle based on the Aeryon SkyRanger is shown in Fig. 5.1. The predictions are for ight at an altitude of 1000 ft above sea level in the diamond conguration and are shown per rotor. The total power required is represented by the solid line and is a summation of its components; the parasitic power, interference power and rotor power. Noting the rotor number convention presented in Fig. 3.2, as Rotor 2 and Rotor 4 are opposite each other about the symmetry line, they both have the same power requirements and thus, identical power decomposition plots. All rotors are assumed to have the same power requirements and thus, the rotor power is identical between plots. The rotor power is the main contributor to the total power in hover, but decreases over the ight-speed range as the induced power decreases (Eq. 2.11). As the rotor tilts forward during

52

CHAPTER 5.

CASE STUDIES

5.1.

EFFECT OF ALTITUDE

increasing forward ight, the rotor must work harder to meet power requirements and therefore, the rotor power increases. The parasitic power is equal across rotors, as the total drag is shared between the rotors. The parasitic power is zero in hover (Eq. 2.10), but becomes more inuential at high speeds as it is proportional to the velocity cubed. The interference power for Rotor 2 and Rotor 4 is negative, resulting in a decrease in the total power required. This is a result of the neighbouring rotors and their wakes having an upwash eect on Rotors 2 and 4. The rear rotor, Rotor 3, has a positive interference power that increases over the ight-speed range. As the vehicle increases its forward velocity, the angle of attack increases as well as the skew angle of the wakes shed from the rotor plane. The wakes shed from Rotors 1, 2 and 4 are positioned close to the rear rotor plane at high velocities, causing a downwash eect for the rear rotor. This interference increases the total power required for the rear rotor.

EFFECT OF ALTITUDE

The eect of altitude on the overall vehicle performance was investigated using the prediction model and experimental performance data. For the same vehicle and rotor geometry, performance predictions were calculated at 1000 feet, 2500 feet and 5000 feet. The rotor power at each altitude is shown versus the forward ight speed in Fig. 5.2. In hover and at low airspeeds, the vehicle requires more power to operate as the altitude increases. This is due to the reduction of air density as the altitude increases. For higher airspeeds, the lower air density results in a lower parasitic drag, and thus power, lowering the power requirements at high altitudes.

Figure 5.2: Rotor power predictions versus forward ight speed at various altitudes for T-Motor rotor.

This study demonstrates that the model is capable of providing a means of eectively analyzing the performance of an sUAS over a ight-speed range and for dierent ight altitudes. By predicting the performance of the vehicle at various altitude, it is shown that low speed and hovering ight should be performed at low altitudes and fast forward ight performed at high altitudes to achieve the best power requirements. In addition, the sUAS in this conguration performs better in low speed and hovering ight, than during fast forward ight.

EFFECT OF WEIGHT

5.2 Eect of Weight
In this study, the power required is investigated as a function of the weight. A T-Motor 18 inch by 6.1 inch rotor is used in this example on the Aeryon SkyRanger body. The predictions are for an altitude of 1000 ft and the sUAS is in the standard diamond conguration, that is Rotor 1 is in the lead and Rotor 3 in the rear. Rotors 2 and 4 are to left and right of the symmetry plane of the ight vehicle. To decouple the eect of the parasitic drag from the weight, the physical geometry of the sUAS is not changed, leaving the parasitic drag equivalent across data sets. The rst weight is the weight of the sUAS with no payload added and is about 3 kg. The second weight represents a camera mounted on the sUAS and is a total weight of 3.62 kg. Finally, the third weight represents an additional battery added to the system for a total weight of 4.2 kg. Quite obviously and supported by Eq. 2.6, a higher thrust is required to operate if the weight of the sUAS is increased. This relationship is also shown in Fig. 5.3 that shows the thrust per rotor versus the forward ight speed for the aforementioned sUAS with and without payload and an extra battery is plotted. In all cases, as the forward velocity of the quadcopter is increased, the thrust increases as well.

Figure 5.3: Thrust per rotor versus forward ight speed for sUAS with three dierent ight masses.

The change in the weight of the vehicle also aects the angle of attack as seen in Fig. 5.4, which indicates lower angles of attack over the entire ight range for the vehicle with a payload added. This 56

relationship is supported by rearranging Eq. 2.6 for angle of attack, showing an increase in the weight, and thus the thrust, results in a decrease in the angle of attack. This is further shown in Fig. 5.5,

that shows force diagrams for two sUAS with the same parasitic drag, but dierent ight masses. To compensate for the increase in weight, the thrust vector must be increased, resulting in a decrease in the angle of attack.

EFFECT OF ORIENTATION IN FORWARD FLIGHT

Finally, Fig. 5.6 shows the eect of the weight on the rotor power required. As discussed in Sec. 2.3, the rotor power consists of the prole power and the induced power. In hover, the portion of the power required that is attributed to the induced power is at its greatest. As the forward ight speed increases, the induced velocity and thus the induced power decreases up to a certain speed [17]. The crossover that occurs around 24 m/s is due to incomplete airfoil data in the rotor performance table. Above a certain speed, thrust loading, on which induced power depends, increases as the rotor must increasingly compensate for the parasitic drag that grows with the velocity squared.

Figure 5.6: Rotor power versus forward ight speed for sUAS with payloads and empty weight.

In conclusion, the eect of weight on the performance of an sUAS was investigated. Through this study, the capability of the model as a design tool was shown. For example, based on the battery

capacity and the motor eciency, designers can determine if the additonal power available provided by an extra battery in the system is worth the added weight.

5.3 Eect of Orientation in Forward Flight
Another characteristic of the vehicle performance that can be explored using the aforementioned analysis tool is the eect of the orientation of the vehicle in forward ight. Referring to Fig. 3.2, two orientations

are presented, the square conguration where two rotors are leading and the diamond conguration, where one rotor leads. In this case study, performance predictions over a ight range for the geometry of the Aeryon Skyranger using experimental T-Motor rotor data were obtained for both square and diamond congurations for an altitude of 1000ft. The total power required for the vehicle in each conguration is presented in Fig. 5.7. Comparing the performance in the two congurations, more power is required to operate in the square conguration than in the diamond conguration over the ight-speed range. As the inow from the neighbouring rotors is not included in the rotor performance prediction, the value of the rotor power does not change between orientations. The parasitic power will also be constant between the two congurations. Therefore any dierence in the power required is a result of the change in the interference power. In hover, the two orientations require the same amount of power since the induced interference power is zero during hovering ight (Eq. 3.16). As the forward velocity is increased, the interference power increases more in the square conguration, than in the diamond conguration, resulting in a higher total power over the ight-speed range in the square conguration. This can be explained by investigating the interference power per rotor.

Figure 5.7: Total power required for diamond and square conguration using T-Motor rotor experimental data.

The total power required and interference power for each rotor in both congurations are presented in Fig. 5.8 to illustrate the dierence in rotor power between the two congurations. Noting the line of

symmetry in each conguration in Fig. 3.2, Rotors 2 and 4 have the same power requirements in the diamond conguration. In the square conguration, Rotors 1 and 2 and Rotors 3 and 4 have the same power requirements. The orientation of the vehicle in forward ight is important, as the wakes shed from the rotor plane are in dierent locations in the two orientations. Therefore, their interactions with neighbouring rotors dier in the two cases since position eects the velocity induced by the wakes. For example, wakes

positioned farther away from a given point will induce a smaller velocity at that point. In the square conguration, Rotors 3 and 4 act as the rear rotors. As supported by Eq. 3.17, as the vehicle speed increases, the skew angles of the shed wake increases as well. The shed wakes of the front rotors, Rotors 1 and 2, pass underneath the rear rotors, increasing the power required as they are caught in the downwash of the wakes. This is supported by Fig. 5.8 which shows a positive and equal interference power for Rotors 3 and 4 in the square conguration, resulting in an increase in the power required. Note the negative interference power for the front rotors, Rotor 1 and 2, in the upwash of the neighbouring rear rotors. In the diamond conguration, Rotor 3 acts as the rear rotor. As there is only one rotor in line

with the rear rotor in the diamond conguration, a positive interference power that is smaller than in the square conguration is present. The remaining rotors in the diamond conguration all experience a negative interference power, resulting in a decrease in the total power required for each rotor. This combination of eects results in a smaller total power required in the diamond conguration as compared to the square conguration as presented in Fig. 5.7. From this study, the eect of the vehicle orientation on the performance of the vehicle was investigated. While in hover and low speeds, the power requirements for the two congurations are about the same, during fast forward ight, the sUAS requires about 5% less power in the diamond conguration than in the square conguration. conguration. Therefore, fast forward ight should be performed in the diamond

Conclusions
This thesis presents a method for predicting the performance of multirotor sUAS in hover and forward ight, with the purpose of aiding the design process of multirotor sUAS by allowing designers to assess the contributions of the vehicle and rotor geometry, as well as atmospheric conditions on the performance of the vehicle. The use of an interpolation scheme with tabulated rotor performance data allows for

exibility, as the data can be provided using experimental or predicted rotor data. The method uses a wake interference model, that captures the eect of rotors and the wakes. The modular approach

allows designers to easily assess the contributions of the vehicle conguration, choice of rotor system and atmospheric conditions on the performance of the vehicle. The study shows that the model is suited for the iterative conceptual design stage of product development. When comparing predictions produced by the method with ight data measured from an Aeryon SkyRanger sUAS the predictions show good agreement in the trends for the rotational velocity, angle of attack and power required. The model captures the trend in the angle of attack during forward ight, though under predicts the value due to the under prediction of the parasitic drag. While the trends in the rotational velocity and the power required are captured, the values are under predicted due to the lack of a motor model. Case studies have been presented in this thesis that explore the capabilities and functionality of the method. The method is capable of evaluating the eect of altitude on the performance of the vehicle. This feature of the model allows designers to assess the performance of a design in dierent conditions, as well as select the right rotor for the altitude. The eect of weight on the vehicle is also discussed;

CONCLUSIONS

results of the case study show the model can be used as a design tool to asses the eect of additional components to the vehicle. Finally, the method is used to assess the performance of a quadrotor sUAS in two dierent orientations, showing that the diamond conguration results in the least power required during forward ight. This study can be extended to evaluate the performance of co-axial rotors, as well as more complicated rotor congurations. It is suggested from the ndings of these studies that fast forward ight be performed at high altitudes, while hover and slow ight be performed at low altitudes. In addition, forward ight should be performed in the diamond conguration since it was shown that 5% less power is required than in the square conguration. Although the current method for predicting the parasitic drag of the vehicle is proven to produce a good estimate, the accuracy of the model can be improved by using measured wind tunnel drag data. A wider range of scenarios, for example climbing and descending ight, can be analyzed with the addition of a full trim solution and an inow model. These improvements to the current tool will make it more robust and more applicable to a broader range of problems.

A general uncertainty analysis was performed using the Taylor Series Method (TSM) as shown by Coleman and Steele[31]. This includes the uncertainties present in the measurement devices used as well as that of the data acquisition system, all of which contribute to the uncertainty of measurements.

The uncertainties in the variables are listed in Table A.2.The uncertainties observed are within an acceptable range, all less than 5 percent, although there is room for improvement. For example, the uncertainty in both the thrust and the power coecient can be decreased by decreasing the uncertainty in the infrared sensor used to measure the rotational velocity of the propeller. Future work is expected to include an upgrade to the testing apparatus through the use of higher accuracy sensors. Table A.2: Uncertainties in Variables

A.2 Experimental Procedure
The experimental procedure begins with the positioning of the propeller test stand. The desired angle of attack must be set before zeroing the system. It is selected by rotating the turn table base until the angle dial is in the correct position. The bolts securing the turn table must be carefully tightened to reduce vibration in the stand. Once all sensors are connected to the LabJack data acquisition system, a software tare is performed to zero the load cells. The ambient pressure is recorded prior to testing. Before forward ight testing is conducted, static tests are performed and compared to existing data to ensure the system is working correctly. For forward ight testing, the propeller motor throttle, and thus the 65

APPENDIX A.

WIND TUNNEL DATA

rotational velocity, is kept constant while the wind tunnel velocity is swept through a range, collecting a variety of data points. Time is given to allow for the tunnel velocity to reach steady state before data points are collected. The raw data is saved, with the tunnel freestream and rotational velocity for each data point recorded, and is then post-processed using a MATLAB script.

A.3 Data Reduction
It is important that the raw data collected during wind tunnel experimentation is properly post processed with all system and external errors accounted for. Raw data is taken for each angle of attack, holding the wind tunnel velocity constant while changing the rotational velocity of the propeller to sweep through advance ratios. The advance ratio (Eq. 1.1) is used as the independent variable when plotting performance coecients and is the ratio of forward ight speed to the speed of the rotor tip. Blockage corrections are not as the diameter of the rotor is relatively small compared to the diameter of the test section. For thrust, pitching moment and torque a basedrag correction is applied to the measured value after conversion to metric units. The basedrag is dened as the drag created by the propeller test stand. This drag is picked up by the load cells and therefore, must be removed from the measurements taken with the propeller in use. For each angle of attack, static data was collected across a range of wind tunnel velocities to be used in a basedrag lookup table. A linear relationship between the dynamic pressure and the force/moment is assumed. Figure A.1 shows an example of the measured basedrag versus the dynamic pressure for an angle of attack of 90 degrees. For each dynamic pressure measured, a corrected basedrag for thrust, pitching moment and torque can be found using linear interpolation. The basedrag values are denoted by subscript "cc" while the corrected values are denoted by subscript "c".
