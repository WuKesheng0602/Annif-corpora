DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF INTELLIGENT BUILDING /SMART BUILDING Master of Engineering, 2017 Dipak Patel Electrical and Computer Engineering Ryerson University

Abstract The intelligent building is supposed to provide the environment and means for an optimal utilization of the building, according to its designation. This extended function of a building can be achieved only by means of an extensive use of building service systems, such as HVAC, electric power, communication, safety and security, transportation, sanitation, etc. Building intelligence is not related to the sophistication of service systems in a building, but rather to the integration among the various service systems, and between the systems and the building structure. Systems' integration can be accomplished through teamwork planning of the building, starting at the initial design stages of the building. This paper examines some existing buildings claimed to be "intelligent", according to their level of systems' integration. Intelligent buildings respond to the needs of occupants and society, promoting the well-being of those living and working in them and providing value through increasing staff productivity and reducing operational costs. Intelligent Buildings considers cultural changes affecting the way people live and work, the importance of an integrated approach to design and management and the benefits technological developments can bring in developing sustainable buildings that meet users' needs.

Introduction
Intelligent buildings apply technologies to improve the building environment and functionality for occupants/tenants while controlling costs, improving security, comfort and accessibility.

Intelligent buildings respond to the needs of occupants and society, promoting the well-being of those living and working in them and providing value through increasing staff productivity and reducing operational costs. Written by authors from practice and academia, Intelligent Buildings considers cultural changes affecting the way people live and work, the importance of an integrated approach to design and management and the benefits technological developments can bring in developing sustainable buildings that meet users' needs. (17) As building owners, facility managers and tenants fully understand the impact modern technology will have on their business operations now and into the future, they will also realize the benefits of network integration of these various systems, devices and applications within t heir buildings or campuses. Through this network approach, they are able to share the value generated by the knowledge worker to be more efficient and productive, and also information generated by existing and future `Intelligent Building' systems, devices and applications to contain operational costs and maximize ROI(Return on Investment) .(5) Rapid advances in technology and the emergence of enterprise distributed computing platforms created the need to integrate IT systems. This integration of applications required a single, low voltage cable distribution infrastructure. The rapid deployment of integrated voice and data systems based on digital transmission and IP based protocols, set the stage for the next step in the technology evolution process. The advent of integrated voice and data digital transmission techniques, coupled with ever increasing data transmission speeds and customer demand for additional

1

information, led to the proliferation of the Local Area Network (LAN) industry. LAN systems and networked devices provided an economical method to connect and distribute information within organizational work groups. The evolution of the integrated IT systems and markets has dramatically effected and guided the development of structured cabling systems. A " total end-toend connectivity solution" offers customers low voltage connectivity that is critically important as the bandwidth, data transfer speeds and mission critical information from various devices attached to the network is transmitted within a building or campus. Information technology in buildings does not refer only to PCs and telephones, but also Building Automation Systems (BAS), such as security (surveillance and access control), Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning (HVAC), and Fire/Life/Safety (FLS) as they transition from electro/ mechanical and pneumatic technology to microprocessor based software driven systems. Leading building automation providers already have state of the art computer based software controlled systems for building management. Most manufacturers of major building automation systems offer computer based, software driven systems, based on distributed processing architectures. These systems are required to interface with other building automation systems and devices, and also to interface with voice, data, LAN and video systems located within a building or campus. (14).(16) Here, based on requirement I contribute my skills to design the building automation project. This consist hardware design, hardware selection, program controller with designed sequence of operation, commissioning controllers for its proper operation and create graphics for end user operation. Details are described in later part of the project.

Motivation A big Hindu Temple is built in 2007 called BAPS. This temple add the community hall and residence for priests in 2012. They have 2 floors concrete structure with various mechanical equipment and under floor heating system implemented for heating and cooling purpose. It was a big challenge to bring all equipment under one umbrella and control using centralized control system. To operate this different equipment locally, there must be an operator work 24/7. Also, these equipment needs to have alarm system to notify the operator in case of failure of any mechanical equipment. Also, there is no system which can analyze the performance of the system and give suggestion to improve the system. Also, there is no graphics interface to view the detail performance of the system. So, in nutshell, there are quite a few challenges to control these mechanical equipment. Challenges :      Control multiple mechanical equipment using centralized control. Required alarm system to notify the fault in the system. Required performance analysis using trends to improve the system. Required graphics interface to watch the system with real time data and control over it Required design and implementation of automation system to perform the system automatically. Objectives and Contribution These challenges brought to my attention. To overcome all challenges, the only solution can implemented would be centralized building automation system or intelligent building automation system.

3

The new add on building has 7 Rooftop units, 8 manifolds to control the under floor heating system. These building needs control system design which includes detail study of mechanical equipment and needs layout to control it. First of all, I design a sequence of operation for each mechanical equipment. Based upon that, next step is to choose controller and peripheral devices to accommodate the sequence of operation. Once hardware is selected, need wiring diagram to do wiring between controller and equipment. This results in detail wiring diagram for each equipment. To perform centralized control system, there is a need for network between controllers and communicate them to one another o ver common protocol language. Once the hardware design is completed, there is a need to run wires for peripheral devices like space sensors, duct sensors, relay wiring to control the equipment and under floor sensors, control valves etc. All field wires comes back to controller which controls the equipment using control algorithm. Contribution :       Design and implementation of building automation system Hardware selection based upon the application of the unit Design the sequence of operation, control algorithm, control drawing- wiring diagram Hardware installation, programming controller and commissioning Verify sequence of operation and functional test of the system Graphics design and implementation to monitor and control the system locally and remotely Below are the details about control drawing which explains the entire control system design.

1. History and Technological Evolution of Intelligent Building
As the Figure-1 below, Buildings uses 39% of the total energy consumption as highest of all energy consumption. This building portion is total of residential and commercial building consumption. So, there is huge opportunities of making this building intelligent to control it better and interact it with end users.(1).(3)

Figure -1. Summary of Energy Consumption

Figure - 2 Technological Evolution of Building Automation Systems In early 60s', the Pneumatic Controls control the major HVAC system in the buildings. It uses large air compressors to compress the air to control the major component of the HVAC systems. It was expensive and local control over the equipment. Late r on, Electrical controls took place to control the HVAC system. In 70s', the Electronics controls change the electrical controls into Electronics. In 80s', BACnet and LON protocol made big revolution in the industry. This protocol unified the platform to bring different devices together first time. Later on, internet with IT concepts made the building automation control remote and wireless. Now, IT becomes the standard for building automation with industry standard protocols.(3)(7).

1.1. Typical building Vs Integrated Buildings
As we seen in the Figure -3, typical building with no integration has five different segments to control the entire building. All five segments which is Fire Management System, Door Access and Intrusion Detection, Lighting Control System, HVAC Control System and Main Electrical/Power distribution system are controlled individually. In this system, there is no link between two systems. The building control locally using computer as an interface. There is no interaction with Humans as system operates individually and locally. In case of emergency, one system can't pass the signal to the other system to react. No integration is involved to interact the

7

system to one another.

Figure-3. Typical Building with No integration

Figure -4 . fully integrated Building
As shown in figure-4, all systems are connected on a common platform to interact with each other. Finally, entire system has one interface to control, monitor and feedback. The end user

9

whether occupant or operator can interact with the system. End user interact with the system and the system respond to the end user's request.(9).(10).(11)

1.2. Characteristic Intelligent Building

Â·

Designed around Users : Intelligent buildings are designed keeping end user in mind. The end user is play an important role in operating the building. The Occupant of the building input the value to get comfort in the building. Human interaction is needed to control the building.

Â·

Improves Security : Secure access and CCTV camera are the main component of the intelligent building for security. The occupant enters the building through secure designated access. The building track the occupant and provide security through its various systems.(15).

Â·

Enhances Comfort : One of the best feature of intelligent building is to provide comfort to the end user. The end user has capability to change the comfort level by changing the set point. This set point is taken by building automation control system to adjust heating/cooling to provide comfort.(17)

Â·

Provides Energy Savings : This another important feature of the intelligent building to save energy. Building receives data from its sensors all the time. This data get processed by system all the time and take decision to save energy without compromising the comfort of the occupant.(21)

Â·

Enterprise-wide Energy Monitoring : Intelligent building has capability to integrate all the system of the building and bring it to common work station. This work station can access locally as well as remotely. It also has access to all data remotely and monitor in real time. (19).

11

Â·

Everything Communicates : Any intelligent building has HVAC system, Fire system, CCTV system, Energy monitoring system, Security access control system as main components. These all system can interact with each other. Also, they can send and receive command from other systems to re act to the situation. So everything communicates to one another. (17)

Â·

Local Command and Control : All building control systems are connected to common platform and unified the data to a single point control . This single point control is the local work station.(5)

Â·

Remote Command and Control : Building control system is connected to the web server. This web server has capability to access, monitor and control the system remotely.(22)

Â·

The right data to the right people : This system has different layers of access and control capabilities. Different user has different access level to control the system at different level. The system has admin level, programmer level, graphics level, maintenance manger level, engineer level, operator level and guest user level. All this category has different capabilities (22)(16)

2. Practical Design for Building Automation As we seen so far the theory of Building automation. Now here we introduce the practical design of one of the building. Below are the control drawings of the building to design.(20) First of all, I need to work out with wiring layout using mechanical drawings. This is also called rough in estimate. This will include field wiring for peripheral devices and network wiring which is link between controllers. In this project, I use BACnet protocol for building automation.(16) Once wiring lay out is done for field wiring and control wiring, I generate the control drawing showing details about how mechanical equipment is controlled using field controllers. How many inputs and outputs are used to control the mechanical equipment. Each control points needs to be configured in controller with proper range to control the equipment properly. (22) Next part, I design the sequence of operation based on specs provided by design engineer. Sequence of operation decide how the mechanical equipment needs to be operated. This sequence of operation is needs to be converted into the program to load into the controller for proper operation.(23) Now, I choose hardware for controller and peripheral devices. Both needs to be chosen based on operation of the unit. Peripheral devices are the sensors

15

giving data from the field and based upon the data, the control sequence work using the residual program. Once hardware chosen, it needs to be installed with proper installation method. Each controller has its input and output controlling the mechanical equipment. It also need regulated power supply and network connection to communicate with its peer controllers.(20) After I installed controllers and field devices, program needs to be downloaded into the controller to perform the design sequence of operation. These sequence need to be verified for proper operation of the unit. These commissioning process can be done using graphics or using controllers communicating to the central hub. I design the Graphics which is the final product of the building automation and face of the entire control system. Graphics represents all control inputs and outputs with set points,schedules, trends and keep the log of entire system.(19)(22) Below, I mention the step by step process of designing.

Line By Line code example

Below is the example of the Dehumidity Control. This code execures if Dehumidity control is enable. Once it enable, it compares Space humidity with its setpoint. If space humidity is more than its setpoint than it will start Dehumidity mode other wise it stops it. Again it checks again and executes function based on humidity parameters.(18).(20)

39

Functional Block Coding Example
Below is the example of Heating valve control with temperatures of floor sensors and return temperature using the temperature set point. Input parameters are temperatures of floor or return temperature from floor. It has temperature set point. All input parameters are connected to PID loop which calculates based on its internal parameters. If temperatures are lower than the set point, it opens the heating valve to provide more heating. Once it match the set point, valve closes.(24)(22) Control Block

2.4 Live Presentation of the Intelligent Building Project

As we seen until now that we design the project using different phases. First of all design the wiring layout in detail for control wiring. After that choosing the right hardware for particular application. Then design the control drawing for details about the controller wiring. Then write the code to perform the sequence of operation. Later create the graphics template and configure data to the graphics for real time operation. (23)

Now using internet web browser with username and password we can watch, operate and control the entire site using the graphics. All equipment are control using graphics.

2.5 Conclusion

In conclusion, we can state that based on the requirement of the project, entire site was designed to implement the Intelligent building automation system. (21) These building needs control system design which requires detail study of mechanical equipment and how it functions using controls. First of all, I designed a sequence of operation for each mechanical equipment. Then, choose controller and peripheral devices to accommodate the sequence of operation. After hardware selection, need wiring diagram to do wiring between controller and equipment. To perform centralized control system, there is a need for network between controllers and communicate them to one another over common protocol language. Now, peripheral devices like space sensors, duct sensors, relay wiring to control the equipment and under floor sensors, control valves etc. All these controllers are wired and programmed as per sequence of operation. Next step is to commission the controller and verify the operation of the mechanical equipment as per design sequence.(24)(20) Graphics are created and display all points as per requirement. In nutshell, this project describe the details about design and implementation of intelligent building automation system.

BAC-10000 Series FlexStatTM
Description and Application
The award-winning FlexStat is a controller and sensor in a single, attractive package that creates a flexible solution to stand-alone control challenges or BACnet network challenges. Temperature sensing is standard with optional humidity and motion sensing. Flexible input and output configurations and built-in or custom programming ensure that a variety of application needs can be met. Such applications include single- and multi-stage packaged, unitary, and split systems (including high SEER/EER variable speed packaged equipment), as well as factory-packaged and field-applied economizers, water-source and air-to-air heat pumps, fan coil units, central station air handling units, and other similar applications. In addition, an on-board library of programs permits a single model to be rapidly configured for a wide range of HVAC control applications. Thus, a single "one size fits all" FlexStat model can replace multiple competitor models. A single BAC-10163CW, for example, can be configured for any and all of these application options:  Air handling unit, with proportional heating and cooling valves, and with optional economizer, dehumidification, and/or fan status  Fan coil unit, 2-pipe or 4-pipe, proportional or 2-position valves, with optional dehumidification (w/ 4-pipe option) and/or fan status  Heat pump unit, with up to two compressor stages, and with optional auxiliary heat, emergency heat, dehumidification, and/or fan status  Roof top unit, with up to two H/C stages, and with optional economizer, dehumidification, and/ or fan status FlexStats also provide the capability to customize the standard library of sequences using KMC's BACstage programming tool. This enables a local authorized KMC installing contractor to adapt the standard library to the unique site needs and application specific requirements of a particular project. Standard hardware options include a mix of output configurations (relays and universal outputs), optional on-board humidity/motion sensing, and inputs for additional remote external sensors such as outside air temperature and fan status sensors.

STE-6018/6020

Features and Applications
An STE-6014/6017/6019/6018/6020 includes a rotary setpoint dial with warmer/cooler icons. An STE-6013/6015/6017/6019/6018/6020 allows selection of an override condition by pushing the button on the front. A green status LED (not on the STE6017/6019) illuminates according to the user-defined controller configuration (e.g., during setback/setup or during normal/override modes). An STE-6012/6016 transmitter includes an LCD display for the room temperature and setpoint. The temperature display can be toggled between Fahrenheit and Celsius scales. The setpoint is adjustable via the up and down arrow buttons on the front panel. If the system is in normal/override mode, pressing a button will raise or lower the setpoint. When either button is pushed, the display will toggle from room temperature to the setpoint. When the button is released, the number displayed is the new setpoint, and the display will return to room temperature after ten seconds. If the system is in setback/setup (for heating/cooling) mode, pressing either button selects override mode. (See Power Requirements in the Specifications section.) An STE-6010/6014/6015/6016/6017/6018 includes a fourpin EIA-485 (formerly RS-485) data port on the cover's underside for easy temporary computer connection to the network. (Access with a KMD-5624 cable.)

STE-1400 Series Temperature Sensors
Descriptions and Applications
STE-1400 Series 10,000 ohm, Type III thermistor, temperature sensors are available in different housings for surface, duct, duct averaging, immersion, strap-on, and outside air applications. All probes are constructed to provide good heat transfer and fast response. The averaging sensors are available in both plenum-rated cable or with a copper probe. Each STE-1401/1402/1404/1405/1405 duct sensor is encapsulated in a 1/4-inch OD stainless-steel probe. The probe protrudes from the bottom of the sensor housing (if included), minimizing lead-length error. The probe can be inserted directly into the duct for single-point monitoring, and mounting holes are provided to rigidly support the assembly. An STE-1411/1412/1413/1414/1415/1416/1417 averaging duct sensor incorporates numerous sensors inside a copper tube and is available in a 5/16-inch OD bendable copper probe or in a flexible plenumrated cable. The completed assembly acts as a single sensor and any temperature change is averaged across the sensor. The probes can be bent to fit any size duct. An STE-1421/1422 immersion sensor is encapsulated in a 1/4-inch OD 304 stainless-steel probe. The probe protrudes from the bottom of the sensor housing, minimizing lead length error. The probe has a 1/2-inch NPT fitting to be screwed into the HMO4533/4543 brass well or HMO-4534/4544 stainlesssteel well. The STE-1455 strap-on sensor is encapsulated in a two-inch-long, 1/4-inch OD stainless-steel probe. The probe has a five-foot lead wire. The STE-1454 strapon sensor also comes with an enclosure. The STE-1451 outside air sensor is mounted in a weatherproof gasketed enclosure with a sun shield for protection against the outdoor elements. It comes with an LB c/w 1/2" NPT fitting for connection to conduit. The STE-1430 room sensor, designed for temperature measurement of occupied spaces, can be mounted on an interior hollow wall in a standard singlegang electrical box. The sensor is mounted behind a flat brushed stainless-steel plate.
