Abstract     
   This  dissertation  explores  the  effects  of  lack  of  citizenship  on  the  wages  of  low- skilled  Non-Permanent  Residents  (NPRs)  in  Canada--a  category  that   includes  temporary  foreign  workers,  refugee  claimants,  and  people  with  temporary   resident  visas  on  humanitarian  grounds.  The  dissertation  uses  the  2006  census  and   quantitative  methods  (cross-tabulation  and  regression  analysis)  to  evaluate  wage   differences  between  low-skilled  workers  without  citizenship  and  low-skilled  workers  with   citizenship  or  permanent  resident  status.  Differences  are  calculated  at  the  industry   sector  level  and  occupation  level.  The  analysis  further  considers  a  set  of  intrinsic   characteristics  of  low-skilled  workers  (including  sex,  level  of  education,  official  language   ability  and  country  of  birth)  and  their  occupations  (provincial  location,  rural/urban   setting).        Empirically,  this  dissertation  confirms  that  there  is  a  penalty  attached  to  lack  of   citizenship  for  low-skilled  workers.  In  absolute  terms,  low-skilled  NPRs  earn  low   wages.  In  relative  terms,  these  NPRs  earn  less  than  both  the  Canadian-born  and   immigrants  low-skilled  workers  employed  in  the  same  occupations.  Among  low-skilled   NPRs  themselves,  the  Canadian  labour  market  exhibits  a  hierarchy  of  wages  and   labour  experiences  on  the  lines  of  workers'  country  of  birth,  province  of  residence,   and  rural/urban  place  of  work.  Among  low­skilled  workers  born  in  the  same  country,   wages  improve  when  either  citizenship  or  the  rights  attached  to  permanent  residence   are  acquired.

From  a  policy  perspective,  the  dissertation  identifies  the  policy  origins  and  drivers  

of  low  wages  among  low-skilled  non-citizens.  The  thesis  makes  the  case  for  the   relevance  of  quantitative  outcomes  analyzed  through  a  critical  social  lens.  From  a   theoretical  perspective  too,  the  dissertation  also  shows  how  the  state  as  a  biased  broker   (towards  capital)  facilitates  the  implementation  of  non-citizenship  as  a  means  to   accessing  cheap  labour.

   Chapter  One:  Introduction           In  recent  decades,  the  flow  of  temporary  foreign  workers  (TFWs)  to  Canada  has  

increased  dramatically.  A  significant  body  of  academic  research  critical  of  Canada's   migration  policies,  particularly  as  they  pertain  to  low-skilled1  workers,  addresses  this   phenomenon  in  several  ways.  The  present  study  endeavours  to  deepen  our   understanding  of  related  labour-market  and  government  policy  changes  in  light  of  these   findings.   The  existing  literature  offers  strong  evidence  that  TFWs,  particularly  those  in  low- skilled  positions2,  are  significantly  disadvantaged  by  their  lack  of  citizenship.  There  is   also  a  large  body  of  literature  that  details  how  low-skilled  workers  are  uniquely   vulnerable  to  exploitation  by  their  employers.  To  date,  most  academic  research  related   to  this  subject  has  been  qualitative  rather  than  quantitative.  In  contrast,  my  approach  is   mainly  quantitative:  I  attempt  to  calculate  the  cost  of  citizenship  (or,  perhaps  more   precisely,  the  value  of  citizenship)  to  low-skilled  workers  in  the  Canadian  labour  market.      1.1.  Dissertation  Focus  and  Contribution   This  dissertation  focuses  on  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  labour.  A  focus  on  low- skilled  temporary  foreign  labour  is  linked  to  their  greater  vulnerability  if  compared  to  the   high-skilled  temporary  foreign  labour.  As  will  be  presented  in  detail,  low-skilled   temporary  foreign  workers  have  much  less  access  to  citizenship,  less  opportunities  to

  According  to  Employment  and  Social  Development  Canada  (ESDC),  skill  level  is  defined  "as  the  amount   and  type  of  education  and  training  required  to  enter  and  perform  the  duties  of  an  occupation"   (ESDC/HRSDC,  2011).  Low-skilled  occupations  "require,  at  most,  a  high  school  diploma  or  a  maximum  of   two  years'  of  job-specific  training"  (ESDC,  2016a).     2   In  contrast  to  low-skilled  occupations,  high-skilled  occupations  require  education  above  high  school   (ESDC,  2016a).

bring  families  and  are  more  likely  to  work  under  conditions  of  exploitation  and  abuse   than  high-skilled  temporary  foreign  workers.  In  addition,  low-skilled  temporary  foreign   workers  represent  the  largest  proportion  coming  to  Canada  under  the  Temporary   Foreign  Workers  Program.   Of  all  workers  coming  under  the  Temporary  Foreign  Worker  Program  between   2006  and  2015,  55%  were  low-skilled  (IRCC,  2015).    My  focus  on  low-skilled  temporary   foreign  labour  is  also  motivated  by  the  gradual  shift  in  immigration  policy  from   permanent  to  temporary  to  satisfy  labour  market  needs.  Immigration  policy  used  to  be   guided  by  economic  stands  but  with  a  strong  nation-building  vision.  Since  1867,  most   foreign  born  individuals  working  in  Canada  were  assured  citizenship.  Nonetheless,  it  is   worth  mentioning  that  racist  discrimination  selection  persisted  until  1967  when  the  point   system  came  into  being  (Kelley  and  Trebilcock,  1999).  During  the  last  15  years,  a  break   between  migration  and  citizenship  has  occurred.  Most  low-skilled  people  coming  under   the  TFW  program  are  denied  access  to  citizenship.   The  quantitative  nature  of  this  dissertation  represents  a  significant  contribution.   This  dissertation  quantifies  the  impact  that  a  lack  of  citizenship  has  on  the  wages  of  low- skilled  "Non-Permanent  Resident  workers",  hereafter  in  this  study  identified  "NPRs."   Statistics  Canada's  2006  Census  Dictionary  defined  NPRs  as  "persons  who  are  lawfully   in  Canada  on  a  temporary  basis  under  the  authority  of  a  temporary  resident  permit...   NPRs  include  foreign  workers,  foreign  students3,  [and]  the  humanitarian  population"   (Statistics  Canada,  2015).     Quantitative  knowledge  has  cognitive  benefits,  including  the  potential  for

universalization,  methodological  precision  and  rigour.  My  dissertation  makes  four   specific  quantitative  contributions:  1)  it  presents  a  profile  of  low-skilled  labour  in   Canada;  2)  it  uncovers  pockets  of  concentration  of  wages  (low  and  high)  in  the  low- skilled  occupations  analyzed  in  this  dissertation;  3)  it  assesses  wage  differences  among   low-skilled  workers  in  different  categories,  including  citizenship  status  and  country  of   birth;  and  4)  it  gauges  how  much  a  lack  of  citizenship  and  characteristics  including  sex,   province  of  labour,  etc.  influence  the  wages  of  low-skilled  workers  in  Canada.  With  all   this  in  mind,  it  is  my  hope  that  this  dissertation  will  provide  new  knowledge  based  on  a   critique  of  wage  discrepancies  between  low-skilled  NPRs  and  low-skilled  Canadian-born   and  low-skilled  immigrants  ­  knowledge  that  can  then  inform  policy  and  social  action.   The  dissertation's  theoretical  and  empirical  conclusions  are  derived  from  an   assessment  of  relevant  literature  and  government  immigration  policy;  from  a   consideration  of  related  theoretical  debates;  and  from  my  own  original  quantitative   research.  The  findings  of  this  dissertation  are  empirically  significant  because  no   quantitative  study  to  date  has  explored  low-skilled  labour  in  Canada  at  the  same  level  of   detail.  The  level  of  detail  itself  presented  in  this  dissertation  represents  a  significant   contribution  too,  because  it  helps  to  focalize  outcomes,  which  is  helpful  for  more  precise   evidence­based  policy  making.  Such  level  of  detail  requires  a  structure  of  analysis  and   presentation  of  outcomes  with  many  categories  and  subcategories.  The  study  also   engages  and  enriches  a  number  of  theoretical  debates  ­  on  TFW  policy,  on  the   meaning  of  citizenship  (from  the  perspective  of  temporary  low-skilled  labourers),  and  on   the  responsibility  of  the  state.   To  date,  research  that  employs  quantitative  methods  to  assess  labour  market

outcomes  for  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  labour  in  Canada,  particularly  with  respect  to   wages,  has  been  extremely  limited.  While  there  is  extensive  research  on  the  lived   experience  of  low-skilled  migrants  and  considerable  analysis  of  their  situation  in  terms   of  human  rights,  there  is  a  dearth  of  econometric  and  quantitative  analyses  of  low- skilled  labour  in  Canada,  which  reveals  a  significant  gap  in  our  knowledge.  More   specifically,  a  review  of  the  literature  reveals  a  lack  of  systematic  studies  (by   occupation)  that  examine  wage  differences  in  light  of  immigration  status  and  other   characteristics  such  as  sex,  province  of  residence,  rural/urban  status,  age,  level  of   education,  knowledge  of  Canada's  official  languages  and  country  of  birth.  In  other   words,  there  has  been  no  basis  for  assessing  the  impact  that  a  lack  of  citizenship  has   on  the  wages  of  low-skilled  NPRs.     In  my  attempt  to  fill  this  important  gap  in  our  knowledge  of  TFWs,  I  am  hopeful   that  more  detailed  information  on  wage  discrepancies  will  help  us  better  analyze  and   formulate  policies  and  programs  related  to  low-skilled  labour  in  Canada.  To  this  end,  I   raise  the  following  question:  to  what  extent  does  citizenship  status,  combined  with  other   key  intrinsic  characteristics  of  workers  (age,  sex,  level  of  education,  ability  to  speak   English  or  French,  or  place  of  birth)  and  their  occupations  (provincial  location,   urban/rural  setting)  affect  the  wages  of  low-skilled  NPR  workers  in  Canada?  This   question  is  relevant  for  the  following  reasons:  1)  low-skilled  NPRs  likely  receive  the   lowest  wages  among  labourers  working  in  Canada  and,  because  of  their  legal  status,   are  among  the  most  vulnerable4  (Goldring  &  Joly,  2014);  2)  among  low-skilled  workers,   comparing  the  wages  of  NPRs  against  those  of  Canadian-born  (CB)  and  immigrant

  Undocumented  workers  may  face  even  harsher  conditions  than  low-skilled  NPRs.  Unfortunately,  the   lack  of  information  on  this  population  prevents  me  from  including  them  in  my  study.

(IMM)  workers  will  shed  light  on  whether  a  lack  of  citizenship  is  an  important   contributing  factor  to  NPRs'  low-wage  levels;  and  3)  contrasting  the  wages  of  low-skilled   NPRs  against  those  of  CB  and  IMM  will  reveal  whether  a  lack  of  citizenship  can  be  used   by  employers  as  a  means  to  access  cheaper  labour  rather  than  to  fulfill  genuine  labour   gaps.     As  such,  the  following  study  will  provide  an  evidence-based  quantitative   contribution  to  the  otherwise  mostly  qualitative  debate  concerning  the  effects  of  lack  of   citizenship  on  state-made  policies  that  enforce  precarious  conditions  in  the  labour   market.  I  hope  that  the  knowledge  it  provides  on  the  wage  differences  between  low- skilled  citizens  and  noncitizens  will  inform  new  policy  and  program  development.  More   generally,  I  also  hope  that  it  will  allow  us  to  consider  the  extent  to  which  the  state  may   undermine  its  own  capacity  to  effectively  regulate  markets  and  labour  conditions.   Although  temporary  foreign  workers  represent  a  relatively  small  proportion  of  the  total   Canadian  labour  force,5  it  is  nevertheless  imperative  for  the  government  to  focus  on  this   population  (especially  those  considered  low-skilled).  Of  all  workers  legally  working  in  the   Canadian  labour  market,  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  workers  (especially  racialized   workers)6  are  more  likely  than  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  workers  to  experience   precarious  conditions  in  the  labour  market  (Goldring  &  Joly,  2014),  a  likelihood  that   increases  in  agricultural  and  caregiving  sectors  (Goldring  &  Joly,  2014  p.98).  On  the  one   hand,  the  heightened  level  of  precariousness  experienced  by  NPRs  can  be  explained   by  the  specific  terms  and  conditions  of  their  labour  contracts:  an  NPR's  legal  status  is

  According  to  Bandali  (2015),  in  Canada  TFWs  make  up  about  0.55%  of  the  total  labour  force.  In  Alberta,   the  province  with  the  highest  proportion  of  foreign  labour,  TFWs  represent  1.7%  of  the  labour  force;  In   Ontario,  TFWs  make  0.3%  of  the  labour  force.     6   According  to  the  Government  of  Canada's  "Snapshot  of  racialized  Poverty  in  Canada":  `racialized   workers'  refers  to  those  "who  self-described  as  a  visible  minority  on  the  2006  Census"  (2013).

tied  to  the  terms  of  his  or  her  work  permit,  which,  if  broken  (by  the  worker)  may  lead  to   deportation  (Binford  2007;  Faraday,  2012a;  Hennebry  &  Preibisch,  2010b;  Preibisch  &   Binford  2007;  Goldring  et  al.  2009;  Walia  2010;  Hennebry  &  Preibisch  2010;  Faraday   2012  as  cited  in  Goldring  &  Joly,  2014).  In  many  cases,  the  threat  of  deportation  creates   an  incentive  for  workers  to  endure  injuries  in  silence  out  of  fear  of  being  sent  back  to   their  countries  of  origin  or  of  not  being  invited  back  to  work  the  following  season   (Faraday,  2012a).  As  this  example  illustrates,  such  unstable  working  conditions  are  also   directly  related  to  NPRs'  lack  of  either  citizenship  or  permanent  resident  status  (Goldring   &  Joly,  2014).  In  other  words:  "their  vulnerability  is  institutionally  produced  and   sanctioned  through  laws,  regulations,  and  policies  that  are  crosscut  by  racialization"   (Goldring  and  Joly,  2014  p.98).  
  

1.2.  How  will  the  Research  Be  Developed?      In  response  to  the  main  question  raised  in  section  1.1,  this  dissertation  has  four  

specific  objectives:  (1)  to  elaborate  a  profile  of  low-skilled  labour  in  Canada;  (2)  to   uncover  concentration  of  wages  (around  either  low  or  high  values)  in  the  low-skilled   occupations  analyzed;  (3)  to  compare  the  wages  of  low-skilled  NPR  workers  with  those   of  low-skilled  Canadian-born  and  low-skilled  immigrant  workers;  and  (4)  to  evaluate,   with  the  use  of  regression  models,  the  effect  that  a  lack  of  citizenship  has  on  wages  in   relation  to  other  characteristics,  including  age,  sex  and  level  of  education.   To  reach  these  four  objectives,  I  will  focus  on  the  following  six  research   questions  related  to  low-skilled  workers  in  Canada:   Question  One:  What  are  the  demographics  of  low-skilled  labour  in  Canada?   Question  Two:  Do  wages  of  low-skilled  workers  concentrate  around  either  low  or   6  
     

high  wages?   Question  Three:  How  large  are  the  wage  differences  between  NPRs  and  CB  and   between  NPRs  and  IMM  in  each  industry  sector  and  occupation  analyzed  in  this   dissertation?   Question  Four:  How  large  are  the  wage  differences  between  NPRs  and  CB  and   between  NPRs  and  IMM  in  view  of  intrinsic  characteristics  of  workers  (sex,  level  of   education,  ability  to  speak  English  or  French,  or  place  of  birth)7  and  their  occupations   (provincial  location,  urban/rural  setting)  analyzed  in  this  study?   Question  Five:  How  large  is  the  effect  of  a  lack  of  citizenship  on  the  wages  of  NPRs   when  the  variations  in  wages  linked  to  intrinsic  characteristics  above  (including  age)8   are  held  constant?   Question  Six:  Are  wage  differences  the  result  of  existing  citizenship-related   policies?   To  address  these  questions,  I  will  draw  on  2006  census  data,  cross-tabulation  and   regression  analysis  (which  will  be  explained  in  detail  in  chapter  four).  The  research  will   be  framed  within  two  theoretical  lenses:  Rational  Theory  and  Social  Critical  Theory.  As   will  be  further  explained  in  chapter  two,  I  draw  on  these  theories  because  they  provide   tools  compatible  with  a  critical  quantitative  analysis  of  this  topic.  Based  on  these   theories,  as  well  as  other  theoretical  developments  in  the  fields  of  migration,  the  state   and  citizenship,  I  will  then  develop  a  theoretical  critique  of  low-skilled  labour  (chapter   ten).

  As  will  be  explained  in  chapter  four,  this  question  will  be  addressed  using  cross-tabulation  analysis.  Age   is  not  included  in  the  cross-tabulation  analysis,  and,  therefore  is  not  included  in  this  list.   8   Also,  as  will  be  explained  in  chapter  four,  this  question  will  be  addressed  using  regression  analysis,   which  includes  the  variable  Age.

1.3.  Context      In  recent  years,  Canada  has  increased  its  use  of  temporary  foreign  workers  

(TFWs)  under  the  Temporary  Foreign  Workers  program.  The  number  of  low-skilled   temporary  foreign  work  permit  holders  increased  88%  from  26  777  in  2006  to  50  671  in   2013  (IRCC,  2015).  The  number  of  workers  working  temporarily  in  Canada  has   increased  in  most  areas  of  the  labour  market,  including  in  both  high-  and  low-skilled   occupations,  (Siemiatycki,  2010)  though  the  labour  conditions  and  rights  associated  with   each  group  differ  greatly.        While  temporary  foreign  high-skilled  workers  seem  to  have  more  avenues  and  

opportunities  for  immigration,  integration  and  settlement,  temporary  low-skilled  workers   face  many  more  barriers  (Siemiatycki,  2010;  Nakache  and  Kinoshita,  2010).  High-skilled   workers  have  several  pathways  to  permanent  residence,  competitive  salaries  and   options  to  bring  their  families  to  Canada.  In  contrast,  low-skilled  workers  have  low   wages,  cannot  bring  their  families  to  Canada  and  most  of  them  have  no  access  to   citizenship  (Nakache  and  Kinoshita,  2010;  Reed,  2008).  This  study  aims  to  quantify  the   extent  to  which  Canada's  temporary  labour  migration  policies  related  to  a  lack  of   citizenship  contribute  to  NPRs'  low  wages.  Stated  positively,  it  considers  whether   citizenship  provides  a  means  of  economic  protection  against  low  wages  and   precariousness.        The  phenomenon  of  precarious  labour  in  Canada  has  been  well  researched  

(Galabuzi  &  Block,  2011;  Goldring  &  Landolt,  2013;  Goldring  &  Joly,  2014;  Vosko,  2006).   Temporary  foreign  worker  programs  have  been  structured  in  a  way  that  entraps  workers   in  a  revolving  door  of  perpetual  temporariness,  which  in  turn  generates  other  precarious  

8  

     

working  conditions,  including  "job  insecurity,  schedule  and  income  unpredictability,  little   control  or  autonomy,  limited  benefits  and  entitlements,  and  the  absence  of  regulatory   protections"  (Goldring  &  Joly,  2014,  p.94).  Other  features  of  precarity  include  little  or  no   access  to  unionization,  the  need  to  maintain  several  part-time  jobs  and  an  insufficient   number  of  hours  worked  per  week.  Such  precarious  working  conditions  often  generate   stress  in  those  unable  to  meet  their  financial  needs,  which  can  greatly  impact  their   overall  health  and  wellbeing  (Dyson  et.al,  2013).     Among  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  workers,  this  precariousness  is  directly   related  to  their  lack  of  citizenship,  an  unfavourable  status  that  generates  unique  labour   conditions  (Aguiar,  2011;  Basok,  2000;  2007;  2010;  Bauder,  2008b;  Hennebry,  2012;   Goldring  &  Joly,  2014;  Preibisch,  2007;  Sharma,  2002).  Although  low-skilled  temporary   resident  workers  experience  great  insecurity  related  to  their  employment  in  Canada,   their  families  back  home  (especially  their  children)  often  benefit  from  the  remittances   sent  by  a  family  member  working  abroad,  by,  for  example  having  improved  access  to   education.  In  short,  they  have  improved  educational  resources  because  their  parents   earn  more  money  abroad  than  they  could  earn  in  their  homeland.  Despite  this  potential   advantage,  the  social  price  of  working  abroad  remains  high:  families  are  separated  and   communities  lose  their  members  (Lewchuk  &  Leflèche,  2014),  which  is  the  real  tragedy   behind  low-skilled  TFWs  working  in  Canada.9        Temporary  foreign  workers  come  to  Canada  through  different  programs  and  

streams:  live-in  caregivers  mainly  come  through  the  Live-in  Caregiver  (LIC)  program;   agricultural  workers  through  different  streams  including  the  Seasonal  Agricultural

  Some  authors  accordingly  highlight  the  benefits  for  the  workers  in  contrast  with  the  dire  situations  they   leave  behind  in  their  countries  of  origin  (Binford,  2006,  2009;  Satzewich,  2007;  Zermeño,  2008).

Workers  Programs  (SAWs  or  SAWPs),  the  Agricultural  Stream  and  the  Stream  for  Low   Wage  Positions;  and  low-skilled  workers  in  occupations  other  than  agriculture  and   caregiving  mainly  come  through  the  last  stream.      In  Canada,  integration  (access  to  permanent  residence)  via  economic  pathways  

is  permitted  mainly  to  those  possessing  high  skills.  With  the  exception  of  LICs  and  a  few   low-skilled  workers  coming  through  Provincial  Nominee  Programs  (PNP)10  in  British   Columbia,  Alberta  and  Manitoba,  low-skilled  TFWs  have  no  pathway  to  citizenship.  Most   low-skilled  permanent  residents  come  through  non-economic  pathways  like  family   reunification  or  asylum.        The  following  study  considers  different  low-skilled  occupations  beyond  caregiving  

and  agriculture.  However,  as  will  be  shown,  occupations  in  these  two  areas  stand  out.   Most  research  related  to  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  labour  in  Canada  accordingly   focus  on  those  areas.  After  all,  workers  in  these  occupations  comprise  the  largest   number  of  temporary  foreign  workers  per  occupation  (see  chapter  five)  and  the  streams   through  which  they  arrive  are  the  oldest  TFW  programs  in  Canada,  arguably  dating   back  to  the  late  1960s  for  agricultural  workers  and  the  early  1970s  for  live-in  caregivers   (see  chapter  three).  Workers  in  other  low-skilled  occupations  started  to  come  to  Canada   much  more  recently  after  the  opening  of  the  Low-Skilled  Pilot  Program  in  2001  (see   chapter  three).        In  Canada,  many  industry  sectors  including  Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing  and  

Hunting  and  Healthcare  and  Social  Assistance  rely  overwhelmingly  on  low-skilled  TFWs   (these  are  the  top  two  industry  sectors  for  NPRs).  This  industry  sectors'  reliance  on  low-

  Provincial  Nominee  Programs  allow  provinces  and  territories  to  attract  and  select  a  small  number  of   immigrants.  These  programs  are  very  restrictive  since  immigrant  selection  is  a  federal  domain.

skilled  temporary  foreign  labour  may  be  linked  to  the  Canadian  state's  use  of  policy   instruments  including  citizenship.  In  this  dissertation,  it  is  relevant  to  study  the   theoretical  underpinnings  of  both  state  and  citizenship.  Theories  of  the  state  and   citizenship  provide  a  theoretical  explanation  for  the  current  economically-driven   approach  to  immigration  policy,  which  produces  a  situation  of  labour  precariousness   linked  to  lack  of  citizenship  (Faraday,  2016;  Goldring,  2014;  Hennebry,  2012).  The  use   of  temporary  foreign  labour  has  become  a  means  for  employers  to  achieve  higher   profits  (Hennebry,  2012)  -  in  some  cases  it  is  explicitly  included  in  business  models  to   increase  overall  benefits  to  employers  (ESDC,  2014).        As  outlined  above,  many  of  these  benefits  are  harnessed  at  the  expense  of  

workers'  lack  of  rights  related  to  their  lack  of  citizenship  (Basok,  2002).  Jessop  (2015)   argues  that  the  problem  of  the  struggle  for  rights  lies  in  the  fact  that  citizenship  rights   continue  to  be  attached  to  a  model  of  the  state  that  is  no  longer  representative  of  the   current  reality.  The  state  has  sacrificed  its  primary  role  as  a  social  institution  by   facilitating  the  interests  of  transnational  capital.  Conversely,  the  increasing  power  of   financial  institutions  has  usurped  the  primacy  of  the  state  (Jessop,  2015).        Furthermore,  the  model  for  capital  accumulation  in  terms  of  mass  production  and  

mass  consumption  (Atlantic  Fordism)11  was  originally  conceived  within  the  confluence  of   national  institutions,  including  the  economy,  the  state,  citizenship  and  society,  all  of   which  were  confined  to  and  defined  by  a  nation-state  (Jessop,  2014).  Economic   variables  including  wages,  employment  and  budgets  were  all  calculated  within  the  
                                                                                                 
11

  Jessop  (2015)  defines  Atlantic  Fordism  as  "an  accumulation  regime  based  on  a  virtuous  autocentric   circle  of  mass  production  and  mass  consumption  secured  through  a  distinctive  mode  of  regulation  that   was  institutionally  and  practically  materialized  in  the  Keynesian  welfare  national  state."         

11  

     

confines  of  these  national  institutions.  By  confining  the  interaction  between  economic   variables  and  national  institutions  within  the  nation-state,  it  was  possible  to  guarantee   welfare  rights  (which  were  attached  to  citizenship  and,  by  extension,  to  the  nation-state)   (Jessop,  2014).  With  the  rise  of  transnational  capitalism,  the  model  of  mass  production   and  mass  consumption  has  transcended  the  boundaries  of  the  nation-state.  What  were   once  permanent  and  stable  (namely  jobs,  wages  and  rights)  have  been  replaced  by   temporality  and  instability.        Rich  countries  have  opted  for  permanent  temporariness  (to  use  Jenna  

Hennebry's  term  in  Hennebry,  2012)  in  their  labour  markets  to  satisfy  labour  needs  in   both  high-  and  low-skilled  occupations.  An  inequitable  distribution  of  wealth  on  a  global   scale  is  a  significant  driving  factor  in  global  migration.  According  to  Oxfam  International   (2017),  "Eight  men  now  own  the  same  amount  of  wealth  as  the  poorest  half  of  the   world"  (p.2),  a  discrepancy  that  provides  considerable  incentive  for  someone  with  little   opportunities  (poor  labour  conditions,  little  education,  lack  of  economic  resources  and   poverty)  to  move  to  a  country  that  may  offer  better  conditions,  even  if  it  is  only  on  a   temporary  basis.  Countries  with  developed  economies  have  also  identified  two  main   factors  that  benefit  their  economies:  highly  educated  immigrants  (if  they  have  a  high   level  of  proficiency  in  at  least  one  of  the  country's  official  languages)  and  cheaper   foreign  labour.        1.4.  High  Level  Outcomes   This  dissertation  makes  significant  contributions  in  three  areas:  empirical   (quantitative),  theoretical  and  policy.    Briefly,  empirically,  using  quantitative  methods,  this  

12  

     

dissertation  confirms  that  there  is  a  penalty  to  lack  of  citizenship  for  low-skilled  workers.   Five  main  outcomes  stand  out:  1)  Low-skilled  tend  to  concentrate  in  Retail  (CB  and   IMM),  and  occupations  in  caregiving  and  agriculture  (NPRs);  2)  in  absolute  terms,  low- skilled  NPRs  earn  low  wages;  3)  In  relative  terms,  these  NPRs  earn  less  than  CB  and   IMM  working  in  the  same  occupations;  4)  among  NPRs,  the  Canadian  labour  market   exhibits  a  hierarchy  of  wages  and  labour  experiences  on  the  lines  of  province  of   residence,  rural/urban  place  of  work  and  country  of  birth;  5)  among  low­skilled  workers   born  in  the  same  country,  wages  improve  when  either  citizenship  or  the  rights  attached   to  permanent  residence  are  acquired.  The  wages  of  low-skilled  immigrants  are  higher   than  those  of  low-skilled  NPRs  (when  both  groups  of  workers  are  born  in  the  same   country).   Significant  specific  outcomes  include:  1)  The  relative  wages  of  NPRs  (compared   to  the  CB  and  IMM)  in  31  occupations,  out  of  35  analyzed,  are  negative  (NPRs  earn   less  than  CB  and  IMM);  2)  the  regression  analysis  shows  that  lack  of  citizenship  has   significantly  negative  effect  on  wages  when  controlling  for  variables  including   immigration  status,  sex  and  country  of  birth.  In  the  agricultural  sector,  there  are   significantly  negative  wage  differences  when  wages  of  NPRs  are  compared  to  those  of   Canadian-born  and  Immigrants.  Among  NPRs  in  other  selected  occupations  (as  will  be   further  discussed  in  this  dissertation),  in  some  of  those  occupations  wages  are  low,   while  in  others  relatively  high.  Although  some  workers  exhibit  high  (in  some  cases  very   high)  wages,  there  remains  a  concentration  of  low  wages  in  some  key  occupations,   predominantly  in  caregiving  and  agriculture.   Theoretically  this  dissertation  plays  out  the  tensions  and  conflicts  between  the  

13  

     

two  theories  used,  Critical  Social  Theory  and  Rational  Choice  Theory.  The  thesis  makes   the  case  for  the  relevance  of  quantitative  outcomes  analyzed  through  a  critical  social   lens.  From  a  theoretical  perspective  too,  the  dissertation  also  shows  how  the  state  as  a   biased  broker  (towards  capital)  facilitates  the  implementation  of  non-citizenship  as  a   means  to  accessing  cheap  labour.     From  a  policy  perspective,  the  dissertation  identifies  the  policy  origins  and  drivers   of  low  wages  among  low-skilled  non-citizens.  The  analysis  reaffirms  the  policy  process   reflecting  the  emergence  of  stereotypes  linked  to  constructed  characteristics  of  workers   including  skills  capacity,  work  ethic  and  sex.  In  general,  the  analysis  will  demonstrate   how  temporary  labour  policy  spread  over  time  from  caregiving  to  agriculture  and  more   recently  to  other  selected  occupations.  Among  low-skilled  NPRs,  occupations  in   caregiving  and  agriculture  stand  out  as  having  concentration  around  low  wages.    
  

1.5.  Dissertation  Structure   This  dissertation  is  organized  in  the  following  way:  in  the  second  chapter,  I   consider  the  main  body  of  literature  on  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  labour  in  Canada   and  on  the  evaluation  of  labour  market  outcomes  for  low-skilled  workers.  I  then   introduce  the  main  theories  used  in  this  study  (Rational  Choice  Theory  and  Critical   Social  Theory)  as  well  as  theories  of  labour  migration,  citizenship  and  the  state  that  help   unpack  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  labour  in  Canada.  In  the  third  chapter,  I  show  the   policy  origins  of  low  wages  of  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  workers  in  relation  to  three   main  groups  of  occupations  (caregiving  occupations,  agricultural  occupations  and  other   selected  low-skilled  occupations).  I  then  detail  how  policy,  informed  by  the  stakeholders'   actions,  shaped  the  labour  market  outcomes  and  lived  experiences  of  TFWs.  This   14  
     

chapter  also  introduces  the  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  worker  programs  in  Canada.   In  the  fourth  chapter,  I  present  the  methods  and  considerations  used  to  analyze  the   data.  With  the  2006  Census  data,  I  use  cross-tabulation  and  regression  analysis  to   compare  the  wages  of  low-skilled  workers  according  to  immigration  status,  while   accounting  for  other  factors,  including,  sex,  level  of  education,  province  of  residence   and  country  of  birth.  In  the  fifth  chapter,  I  present  a  general  profile  of  low-skilled  workers   in  Canada.  In  the  sixth  chapter,  I  explore  the  concentration  and  distribution  of  both   absolute  and  relative  wages  of  NPRs  (compared  to  those  of  the  Canadian-born  and   immigrant)  by  industry  and  occupation.  In  the  seventh  chapter,  I  focus  on  the  cross- tabulation  analysis  of  relative  wages  of  low-skilled  workers  (NPRs  compared  to  CB  and   IMM)  by  each  of  the  intrinsic  characteristics  (of  workers  and  of  occupations)  already   mentioned.  In  the  eighth  chapter,  I  introduce  the  outcomes  of  the  regression  analysis.  In   the  ninth  chapter,  I  explore  the  outcomes  of  chapters  five,  six,  seven  and  eight  and   consider  them  in  relation  to  each  of  the  variables  analyzed  in  the  literature  on  low-skilled   labour  by  occupation  in  Canada.  Finally,  in  the  tenth  chapter,  I  consider  from  a   theoretical  perspective  the  role  of  migration,  the  state  and  a  lack  of  citizenship  on  labour   market  outcomes  and  experiences  of  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  workers  in  Canada.                    

15  

     

Chapter  Two:  Literature  Review  and  Theoretical  Approaches      The  experience  of  low-skilled  temporary  foreign12  workers  in  Canada  is  an  

important  addition  to  the  existing  research  on  immigrants  in  Canada.  This  chapter   provides  an  overview  of  the  literature  and  theoretical  approaches  guiding  this  thesis  in   order  to  identify  the  important  contributions  made  in  this  field  as  well  as  uncover  critical   gaps.  It  explores  seven  related  themes.  In  the  first  section,  I  present  the  existing   literature  on  labour  related  themes  affecting  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  workers  in   Canada,  which  includes  the  main  literature  on  the  evaluation  of  wages  of  low-skilled   immigrants,  to  identify  the  central  issues  and  important  gaps  in  this  literature.  In  the   second  section,  I  introduce  Rational  Choice  Theory  (RCT)  and  Critical  Social  Theory   (CST),  which  together  provide  the  theoretical  foundation  of  my  analysis.  In  the  third   section,  I  focus  on  Labour  Migration  Theories  in  relation  to  RCT  and  SCT.  I  draw  on   three  migration  theories  to  explain  wage  discrepancies  among  low-skilled  temporary   foreign  workers  (TFWs)13  and  low-skilled  Canadian-born  (CB)  and  low-skilled  immigrant   workers  (IMM).  These  theories  help  illuminate  the  relations  among  and  the  decisions   made  by  the  different  actors  involved  in  the  labour  market  experiences  of  low-skilled   NPRs.  In  the  fourth  section,  I  present  an  overview  of  neoliberalism,  which  plays  a   significant  role  in  providing  a  justification  for  the  current  flow  of  international  migration  by   invoking  discourses  on  trade  and  globalization.  In  the  fifth  section,  I  provide  a  general   overview  of  the  most  relevant  works  on  citizenship  in  relation  to  low-skilled  labour.  I   detail  how  a  lack  of  citizenship  is  used  to  validate  the  construction  of  temporary  foreign

  For  clarity's  sake,  the  terms  `Temporary  Foreign  Workers'  or  `TFWs'  will  be  reserved  for  citing  research   in  the  literature  about  TFWs.  The  term  "Non-Permanent  Residents"  or  `NPRs'  will  be  used  in  relation  to   the  NPR  population  and  their  outcomes  in  the  labour  market.   13   As  explained  in  chapter  one,  in  this  dissertation  the  'NPR  population'  includes  temporary  foreign   workers,  refugee  claimants  and  people  with  temporary  resident  visas  on  humanitarian  grounds.

low-skilled  labour.  In  the  sixth  section,  I  present  a  revision  of  citizenship  and  the  nation   state,  as  a  preamble  to  the  following  section.  Finally,  in  the  seventh  section,  I  explore   Bob  Jessop's  theoretical  work  on  the  state.  His  work  provides  the  theoretical  tools   required  to  tease  apart  how  the  state  constructs  labour  (in  this  case  via  a  lack  of   citizenship).  Together,  the  two  foundational  theories  (RCT  and  CST),  as  well  the  related   theories  of  migration,  the  state,  and  citizenship,  will  help  unpack  the  complexity  behind   the  current  situation  of  low-skilled  TFWs.  
  

2.1.  Low-Skilled  Temporary  Foreign  Labour  in  the  Canadian  Labour  Market        Low-skilled  TFWs  (low-skilled  NPRs  in  this  dissertation)  refers  to  temporary  

foreign  workers  classified  as  "low-skilled"  in  the  National  Occupational  Classification   (NOC).  The  NOC  system  is  "the  nationally  accepted  taxonomy  and  organizational   framework  of  occupations  in  the  Canadian  labour  market.  It  is  a  four-tiered  hierarchical   arrangement  of  occupational  groups  with  successive  levels  of  disaggregation.  It   contains  broad  occupational  categories,  major,  minor  and  unit  groups"  (Employment   and  Social  Development  Canada  ­  ESDC,  2011)14.  ESDC  defines  skill  level  "as  the   amount  and  type  of  education  and  training  required  to  enter  and  perform  the  duties  of   an  occupation"  (ESDC/HRSDC,  2011).  Skill  levels  are  classified  according  to  the   following  criteria:      "Skill  level  0:  Managerial  Occupations;  Skill  level  A:  University  degree  

(bachelor's,  master's  or  doctorate);  Skill  level  B:  Two  to  three  years  of  post-secondary   education  at  a  community  college,  an  institute  of  technology  or  CÉGEP  or  two  to  five   years  of  apprenticeship  training  or  three  to  four  years  of  secondary  school  and  more

than  two  years  of  on-the-job  training,  occupation-specific  training  courses  or  specific   work  experience.  Occupations  with  supervisory  responsibilities  are  also  assigned  to  skill   level  B.  Occupations  with  significant  health  and  safety  responsibilities  (e.g.,  firefighters,   police  officers  and  licensed  practical  nurses)  are  assigned  to  skill  level  B;  Skill  level  C  -   Completion  of  secondary  school  and  some  short-duration  courses  or  training  specific  to   the  occupation  or  some  secondary  school  education,  with  up  to  two  years  of  on-the-job   training,  training  courses  or  specific  work  experience;  Skill  level  D  -  Short  work   demonstration  or  on-the-job  training  or  No  formal  educational  requirement"   (ESDC/HRSDC,  2011).  Low-skilled  occupations  in  the  NOC  system  correspond  to  the   skill  levels  C  and  D.  This  classification  of  occupations  is  based  on  the  level  of  human   capital  that  a  worker  possesses.      While  human  capital  is  an  important  driving  factor  in  Canada's  immigrant  

selection,  during  the  last  15  years,  federal  policies  have  tended  to  favour  the  increase  of   labour  supply  via  temporary  foreign  workers.  TFW  programs  are  increasingly  used   because  they  offer  a  quick  and  easy  strategy  for  meeting  labour  shortages  by  accessing   a  vast  and  diverse  labour  force,  without  the  economic  and  infrastructural  challenges  of   immigration.  At  the  same  time,  these  programs  are  often  heralded  for  providing  an   opportunity  to  improve  the  lives  of  very  poor  families,  the  communities  in  which  they  live   and,  by  extension,  the  economies  of  their  countries  of  origin  (Lenard  &  Straehle,  2011).   However,  some  contend  that  this  redistribution  of  wealth  can  only  be  obtained  at  the   expense  of  justice  (Lenard  &  Straehle,  2011;  2012).  Indeed,  the  structure  of  TFW   programs  that  place  workers  in  labour  markets  functions  by  segmenting  the  population   of  workers  on  racial  grounds  (Binford,  2008;  Bonacich,  1972;  Trumper  &  Wong,  2010)

and  then  accepting  'unfree'  labour15  from  these  'select'  populations  (Sharma,  2006).  In   Canada,  unfree  labour,  comprised  mostly  of  people  with  temporary  visas  working  under   constrained  conditions,  such  as  live-in  Filipino  caregivers  and  Mexican  agricultural   workers,  remains  concealed  by  ideologies  (Sharma,  2006).      Low  skilled  guest  worker  programs  (also  known  as  low  skilled  temporary  foreign  

workers  programs)  are  the  means  used  by  the  state  to  satisfy  short-term  labour  market   needs.  Both  high-  and  low-skilled  labour  demands  are  increasingly  offset  through  guest- worker  programs  (Siemiatycki,  2010)  that  commodify  workers  (Lenard  &  Straehle,   2012).  These  types  of  programs  have  been  formally  established  in  different  parts  of  the   world.  Surak  (2013)  describes  in  his  article  "Guest  workers:  A  Taxonomy"  the  different   types  of  guest  worker  programs  across  different  countries  and  time  periods.  Surak   points  at  the  need  to  not  just  look  into  the  different  programs'  structures  but  to  the  social   structures  in  which  those  programs  come  into  being,  for  they  significantly  explain  the   variations  from  program  to  program  (Surak,  2013).   The  use  of  temporary  foreign  low-skilled  labour  in  Canada  can  be  traced  back  to  the   time  of  the  construction  of  the  Canadian  Pacific  Railway  (Siemiatycki,  2010).  As  is  the   case  today  with  Mexican  workers  in  the  agricultural  industry,  in  the  late  nineteenth   century,  thousands  of  Chinese  workers  came  to  work  under  conditions  that  residents   would  have  never  accepted.  Back  then,  "Chinese  workers  were  relatively  easy  to   secure,  were  more  servile  than  most  workers,  and  were  willing  to  work  at  wages  30- 50%  lower  than  those  paid  to  white  labourers"  (Kelley  &  Trebilcock,  1999,  p.94).  As  is   the  case  today  with  temporary  foreign  workers,  especially  those  in  low-skilled   occupations,  Chinese  workers  at  that  time  came  from  impoverished  regions,  like  the

  Unfree  labour  refers  to  labour  under  significantly  restrained  conditions.

Guangdong  Province  in  China  (Kelley  &  Trebilcock,  1999,  p.94).  They  also  experienced   restrictions  in  applying  for  citizenship.  Explicating  the  racial  stratification  that   perpetuates  the  flow  of  temporary  foreign  workers,  at  that  time,  race  was  the  main   criteria  used  to  control  immigration:  Chinese  workers  faced  special  restrictions,   including  the  Chinese  Head-Tax  (Kelley  &  Trebilcock,  1999).  Today  immigration   restrictions  are  less  apparent  and  usually  focus  on  education  rather  than  race.   Nevertheless,  these  types  of  policies  set  real  barriers  to  entry,  which  in  turn  lead  to   alternative  pathways  of  entry  such  as  temporary  worker  programs  (Preibisch  &  Binford,   2007).      The  literature  on  the  labour  related  experiences  of  temporary  low-skilled  workers  

in  Canada,  from  a  qualitative  perspective  is  extensive;  in  contrast  quantitative  studies   are  scarce.  Two  streams  of  research  related  to  low-skilled  TFWs  are  particularly   relevant  to  this  dissertation:  1)  issues  related  to  general  labour  conditions,  and  2)  wages   among  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  workers  compared  to  those  with  citizenship16.  The   first  stream  opens  with  issues  that  directly  relate  to  two  specific  TFW  programs  (i.e.  The   Live-in  Caregiver  Program  -  LIC,  and  the  Seasonal  Agricultural  Worker  Program  ­   SAWP),  which  will  be  explained  in  more  detail  in  chapter  three.  The  special  focus  on   these  two  programs  follows  the  fact  that  they  are  the  oldest  and  most  researched  low- skilled  TFW  programs  in  Canada;  the  themes  that  they  raise  reflect  the  central  labour- related  issues  affecting  all  low-skilled  TFWs  in  the  country.    
  

  

2.1.1.  General  labour-related  issue.  Research  on  low-skilled  labour  has  often

  These  topics  will  be  explored  in  more  detail  in  the  following  chapter  in  the  context  of  the  policy  origins  of   low  wages.  

20  

     

focused  on  the  precariousness  and  exploitation  experienced  by  many  low-skilled   workers  coming  to  Canada  through  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  worker  programs.   Focusing  on  the  LIC  program,  Faraday  (2012a)  found  that,  as  of  2012,  wages  of  live-in   caregivers  were  about  $10.56  per  hour,  for  a  maximum  of  48  hours  per  week,  with  a   maximum  deduction  of  $85.25  per  week  for  room  and  board  (Faraday,  2012a).  Although   LICs  are  officially  hired  to  help  with  care-related  activities,  some  researchers  have   documented  work  performed  in  other  areas  (Bakan  &  Stasilus,  2012).  Within  the  domain   of  caregiving,  LICs,  historically  invited  to  care  for  children,  engage  increasingly  in  elderly   care,  raising  questions  about  the  conditions  this  program  should  fulfil  to  address  the   specific  challenges  of  working  with  the  elderly  (Bourgeault  et  al.,  2010).  Regardless  of   the  kind  of  caregiving  responsibility,  LIC  employment  permits  are  dependent  on  the   employer  (Faraday,  2012a);  LICs  often  work  long,  unpaid  hours  (Grandea  &  Kerr,  1998)   and  participation  in  the  program  has  a  significant  impact  on  their  family  life  (Cohen,   2000)  mainly  because  of  their  separation  from  their  husbands  and  children  (Pratt,   2006).  Coming  to  Canada  without  their  family,  few  financial  resources,  often  owing   money,  and  with  little  social  capital,  LICs  are  typically  highly  dependent  on  their   employers  (Torres  et  al.,  2012),  creating  opportunities  for  abuse  and  exploitation   (Brickner  &  Straehle,  2010),  which  have  been  revealed  in  the  media.  Despite  these   unfavourable  conditions,  LICs  are  likely  reluctant  to  voice  criticisms  out  of  fear  that  their   employer  may  impede  or  delay  permanent  residence  (Faraday,  2012a).  Workers  have   little  or  no  choice  of  the  place  of  work,  the  duration  of  their  contract  or  the  type  of  work   they  will  do  and  changing  employers  is  allowed  only  if  approved  by  both  sending  and   receiving  employers  (Hennebry  &  Preibisch,  2012).    

21  

     

  

With  agricultural  workers,  the  employer  has  the  power  to  either  call  or  not  call  the  

worker  for  the  next  season  (Faraday,  2012a;  Hennebry,  2012;  Hughes;  2012).  Wages   among  low-skilled  TFW  agricultural  workers  are  low  (Justice  for  Migrant  Workers,  2006)   and  sometimes  they  are  simply  not  paid  (Fudge  &  MacPhail,  2009).  It  has  also  been   reported  that  there  are  no  mechanisms  to  enforce  some  contractual  rights,  including   employer-paid  transportation  (Nakache  &  Kinoshita,  2010).  Fear  of  deportation  or  not   being  hired  the  following  year  often  leads  workers  to  put  up  silently  with  the  abuses  at   the  workplace  (Hennebry,  2012).17      Some  SAWs  have  been  coming  to  Canada  for  more  than  25  years  and  are  

entitled  to  the  same  rights  as  Canadians  in  terms  of  access  to  the  Canadian  Pension   Plan  (CPP)  and  Employment  Insurance  (EI).  However,  even  though  the  program  started   in  the  late  1960s,  most  workers  were  not  aware  of  these  benefits  and  only  started   collecting  in  2003,  when  activists  learned  about  workers'  eligibility  and  fought  for  their   cause  (UFCW,  2014).  While  this  was  a  significant  gain,  a  study  from  the  United  Food   and  Commercial  Workers  (UFCW)  union  details  how  the  Harper  government  in  2012   curtailed  seasonal  farm  workers'  access  to  EI  special  benefits  (parental,  maternal  and   "compassionate  care"  benefits)  (UFCW,  2014).  Generally,  low-skilled  workers  tend  to  be   granted  fewer  rights  than  high-skilled  workers.  Ruhs  (2008)  presents  the  inverse   relation  between  number  of  workers  and  number  of  rights  (vis-a-vis  skill  levels).  Workers   with  high  levels  of  skills  tend  to  have  more  rights  and  tend  to  be  lower  in  numbers.  In   contrast,  low  skilled  workers  tend  to  have  fewer  rights  and  to  be  higher  in  numbers.

  Some  evaluations  of  labour  conditions  have  had  a  geographic  emphasis:  BC  (Fairey  et  al.,  2008;  Otero   &  Preibisch,  2010),  Alberta  (Nakache  &  Kinoshita,  2010),  Ontario  (Bauder,  2008b;  Bridi,  2010;  Hennebry,   2009;  McLaughlin,  2009),  Ontario  and  Quebec  (De  Luna-Villalón,  2011).

2.1.2.  Wages  among  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  workers.  A  few  studies  

consider  the  effect  of  immigration  in  general  on  the  Canadian  economy.  Some  stress   the  negative  effect  of  immigration  on  the  labour  market  in  the  U.S.  and  Mexico  and  the   positive  impact  in  Canada  due  to  the  high-skilled  nature  of  Canadian  economic   immigration  (Aydemir  &  Borjas,  2006  as  cited  in  Dungan,  Fang  &  Gurdenson,  2012,   p.9).  Other  studies  report  positive  impacts,  highlighting  1)  that  there  is  no  identified   displacement  of  Canadian-born  workers  linked  to  immigration  (Akbari  &  Devoretz,   1992);  2)  that,  while  unemployment  in  British  Columbia  grows  in  the  short  term  because   of  immigration,  it  decreases  over  time  (Gross  2004);  3)  that  there  is  no  evidence  (from   1991,  1996  and  2001  census  data)  of  a  negative  effect  on  wage  growth  for  nationals  in   the  Canadian  labour  market  (Tu,  2010);  and  4)  that  additional  immigration  has  a  positive   effect  on  Canadian  economic  factors,  including  "GDP  per  capita,  aggregate  demand,   government  expenditures,  taxes  and  net  government  balances"  (Dungan,  Fang  &   Gunderson,  2012,  p.23).        There  is  a  dearth  of  literature  focusing  on  low-skilled  labour  (as  a  whole)  in  

Canada,  which  is  why  I  turn  to  the  American  literature.  If  we  consider  patterns  in   America  as  comparable,  some  studies  examine  the  macroeconomic  impact  of  the   inclusion  of  low-skilled  immigrants  in  the  US  (Borjas,  1995;  Card,  2005;  1996;  Weiner,   1996)  with  a  focus  on,  for  example,  the  impact  on  wages,  but  the  results  are  mixed  and   inconclusive.  When  looking  at  the  impact  of  integrating  less-educated,  low-skilled   immigrants,  different  pictures  emerge.  The  increase  of  diversely-skilled  (i.e.  both  low-   and  high-skilled)  immigrants  in  an  economy  has  two  distinct  effects,  one  short-term  and   the  other  long-term.  In  the  short-term,  because  of  productivity  gains  linked  to  a  more  

23  

     

diverse  range  of  available  skills,  the  wages  of  nationals  (those  with  citizenship)  are  not   directly  affected  and  hence  all  workers  are  likely  to  be  better  off.  In  the  long-term,   however,  when  integration  takes  place,  the  skill  formation  of  nationals  is  likely  to  be   negatively  affected  and,  as  a  result,  the  wages  of  citizens  may  decline  (Behrens  &  Sato,   2011).  Conversely,  as  low-skilled  immigrants  accumulate  skills,  labour  stability  and   wages  increase  among  this  population  (Zhang,  2002).        Considerations  about  minimum  wage  in  Canada  are  also  relevant  to  low-skilled  

workers  and  hence  to  this  dissertation.  Raising  minimum  wage  is  a  subject  of  a  vast   economic  analysis.  In  Canada,  minimum  wage  is  shared  responsibility  between   provincial/territorial  governments  and  the  federal  government.  The  media  has  reported   cases  of  people  in  Canada  with  different  legal  statuses  earning  less  than  the  minimum   wage:  Canadian-born  (Kurjata,  2015);  immigrants  (Movilla,  2010),  and  temporary   foreign  workers  (Pearson,  2015).  Statistics  Canada  reports  that  it  is  possible  to  find   cases  of  employees  legally  being  paid  less  than  minimum  wage,  since  young  adults   under  18  years  of  age  may  be  exempt  from  minimum  wage  regulations  (Statistics   Canada,  2004;  2010).  Disabled  people  have  also  been  "lawfully"  paid  below  minimum   wage  (Fuatai,  2016).        In  2005,18  the  minimum  wage  in  Canada  varied  from  $6.15/hour  in  Newfoundland   to  $8.50/hour  in  Nunavut  (see  appendix).  Three  arguments  are  generally  made  against   raising  the  minimum  wage:  1)  since  so  few  people  earn  minimum  wage,  the  problem  is   trivial;  2)  most  minimum  wage  earners  are  teenagers  living  at  home;  and  3)  increasing   wages  without  increasing  production  is  ultimately  harmful  to  low-wage  earners   themselves  (Stuart  &  Hugh,  2007).    
                                                                                                 
18

    Wages  in  the  2006  Census  report  all  wages  and  salaries  earned  in  2005.  

24  

     

  

These  arguments  are  weak  for  the  following  reasons:  1)  The  most  recent  

Statistics  Canada  study  on  minimum  wage  shows  that  in  2009,  5.8%  of  all  workers  in   Canada  earned  minimum  wage  (Langevin,  2010).  Although  the  proportion  appears  to  be   small,  the  actual  number  (about  817  000)  is  not.  As  chapters  one  and  five  in  this   dissertation  indicate,  the  situation  of  precarious  labour  in  Canada  is  increasing  and   represents  a  growing  problem  (PEPSO,  2015).  2)  In  2010,  teenagers  (15-19  years  of   age)  represented  38%  of  all  minimum  wage  earners  (Langevin,  2010).  Is  dismissing   their  situation  a  good  policy  response?  To  exclude  a  group  just  because  of  who  they  are   rather  than  valuing  what  they  do  is  discriminatory  (Stuart  &  Hugh,  2007).  Many  of  these   persons,  most  likely  dependent  on  their  jobs  to  finance  their  studies,  may  not  live  at   home;  and,  if  they  do,  it  is  evidence  of  the  ways  in  which  precarious  working  conditions   pushes  families  to  increase  the  number  of  earners  per  household  (PEPSO,  2015).  3)   The  impact  of  minimum  wage  on  employment  has  been  explored  significantly  in  the   literature  for  a  very  long  time.        Two  broad  types  of  studies  are  found  in  the  literature,  one  of  which  is  based  on  

the  principle  in  economics  that  "if  the  price  of  minimum  wage  labour  goes  up,  less  of   that  labour  will  be  demanded"  (Stuart  &  Hugh,  2007,  p.34).  Although  not  all  economists   arrive  at  the  same  conclusion,  most  studies  with  this  focus  show  that  minimum  wage   mostly  affects  teenagers  (Stuart  &  Hugh,  2007,  p.34).  Even  if  these  studies  predict   some  effect  on  teenagers'  employment,  some  counter  arguments  have  also  been   raised,  including  publication  bias,  failure  to  capture  dynamic  positive  effects  and   disproportionate  focus  on  misemployment  effects.  The  other  type  of  studies  argues  that   "minimum  wage  impacts  are  virtually  invisible  over  time  because  they  are  swamped  by  

25  

     

other  more  significant  economic  changes"  (Stuart  &  Hugh,  2007,  p.35).      Having  considered  specific  factors  that  impact  the  lived  experiences  and  working  

conditions  of  temporary  foreign  workers,  I  will  now  turn  to  two  theoretical  approaches  to   understanding  the  flow  of  migrant  workers.  
  

2.2.  Rational  Choice  Theory  (RCT)  and  Critical  Social  Theory  (CST)      This  section  presents  the  general  tenets  of  these  two  theories  and  the  reasons  

why  they  were  chosen  for  this  research.         2.2.1.  Rational  Choice  Theory  (RCT).  Some  link  Rational  Choice  Theory  to  Max  

Weber's  Theory  of  Action  (Delanty  &  Strydom,  2003),  which,  as  in  Adam  Smith's  "The   Wealth  of  Nations,"  assumes  rational  choice  as  one  of  the  determinants  of  social  action.   The  most  relevant  writings  on  this  theory  appeared  in  the  1960s  and  are  attributed  to   Mancur  Olson,  Peter  Blau  and  TC  Schelling  (Delanty  &  Strydom,  2003).  Rational   Choice  Theory  provides  the  theoretical  framework  supporting  the  quantitative  methods   used  in  this  dissertation,  namely  cross  tabulation  and  regression  analysis,  because  its   fundamental  assumption  that  rational  actions  are  those  that  maximize  benefits  and   minimize  costs  lends  itself  well  to  mathematical  quantification.  In  short,  a  rational  choice   framework  provides  tools  to  quantify  the  effects  of  certain  policies  as  well  as  to   understand  the  motivations  that  prompted  them.        Rational  Choice  Theory  assumes  that  all  actions  are  fundamentally  `rational'  and  

that  people  make  a  priori  cost/benefit  evaluations  of  their  actions  before  making  a   decision  (Scott,  2000),  an  assumption  that  underlies  most  economic  theories  (Simon,   1955).  In  this  context,  to  identify  a  person  as  rational  assumes  that  he  or  she  has   26  
     

sufficient  knowledge  of  the  environment  and  conditions,  a  clearly  structured  system  of   preferences  and  a  decision-making  system  that  allows  him  or  her  to  make  a  decision   that  maximizes  benefits  (Simon,  1955)  and  minimizes  costs.  The  standard  constraints   found  in  Rational  Choice  models  include  "(1)  the  set  of  alternatives  open  to  choice,  (2)   the  relationships  that  determine  the  pay-offs  (`satisfactions,'  `goal  attainment')  as  a   function  of  the  alternative  that  is  chosen,  and  (3)  the  preference-orderings  among  pay- off"  (Simon,  1955,  p.100).  Economists  see  rationality  not  as  choosing  different  means  to   an  end  but  choosing  "among  different  goals  according  to  a  consistent  scale  of   preferences"  (Harsanyi,  1969,  p.517).  From  a  wage  analysis  perspective,  "in  this  theory   it  is  postulated  that  humankind  is  inherently  seeking  the  highest  profit  possible  for   his/her  labour  and  will  move  to  no  matter  where  as  long  as  it  pays  off."  (Van  Houtum  &   Van  der  Velde,  2002).  If  both  employers  and  workers  want  to  maximize  benefits  and   minimize  costs,  "on  a  simple  level,  employees  prefer  higher  wages  and  shareholders   prefer  lower  wages  (at  the  same  level  of  productivity)"  (Roe,  2003,  p.34).  From  the   perspective  of  Mexican  workers  working  through  the  SAWP,  for  example,  three  main   motivations  have  been  identified  as  driving  factors  to  participate  in  Canada's  SAWP:   increase  and  stable  income,  better  education  for  the  workers'  children,  possibilities  of   investment  in  the  house/farm  in  Mexico  and  general  improvement  in  the  quality  of  living   (Binford,  2002;  Stallman  &  Carvajal,  2016).        As  this  example  illustrates,  comparison  is  at  the  heart  of  making  a  rational  

choice.  In  short,  "rational  choice  is  about  comparing  values  of  different  options"   (Jonassen,  2011,  p.54).  Accordingly,  in  my  cross-tabulation  analysis,  the  aggregated   wages  are  compared  by  subcategory  to  explore  different  levels  of  preferences  among  

27  

     

those  setting  wages.  For  example,  the  wages  of  male  Canadian-born  low-skilled   workers  are  compared  with  those  of  male  low-skilled  Non-Permanent  Residents   (NPRs).  Similarly,  the  wages  of  CB  with  post-secondary  education  are  compared  with   those  of  NPRs  with  post-secondary  education.  In  the  regression  analysis,  preferences   are  also  explored  by  establishing  the  degree  of  relation  of  dependence  (see  chapter   eight)  between  wages  (dependent  variable)  and  independent  variables,  for  example,  the   effect  of  being  female  on  wages.  Regression  analysis  is  also  used  to  reveal  the   preferences  of  those  who  set  wages.      There  are  three  main  limitations  (cognitive  biases)  associated  with  the  

judgmental  heuristic  nature  of  rational  choice  based  modelling  (which  is  similar  to  the   multi-variate  regression  analysis  used  in  this  dissertation):  "(i)  representativeness,  which   is  usually  employed  when  people  are  asked  to  judge  the  probability  that  an  object  or   event  A  belongs  to  class  or  process  B;  (ii)  availability  of  instances  or  scenarios,  which  is   often  employed  when  people  are  asked  to  assess  the  frequency  of  a  class  or  the   plausibility  of  a  particular  development;  and  (iii)  adjustment  from  an  anchor,  which  is   usually  employed  in  numerical  prediction  when  a  relevant  value  is  available"  (Tversky  &   Kahneman,  1974,  p.1131).  While  some  critics  point  to  the  unrealistic  "behavioral   assumptions  of  rational  choice  models"  (Friedman  &  Hechter,  1988,  p.212)  and  argue   that  they  leave  out  complexities  present  in  the  real  world  (Friedman  &  Hechter,  1988),  I   maintain  that  Rational  Choice  Theory  nevertheless  provides  a  good  foundation  for  using   modelling-based  analysis  as  well  as  multivariate  regression  analysis.  It  links  micro  and   macro  levels  of  analysis  (Friedman  &  Hechter,  1988),  providing  a  good  "agnosticism   with  respect  to  types  of  data  and  techniques  of  data  reduction,"  which  improves  "...the  

28  

     

quality  of  empirical  analysis"  (Friedman  &  Hechter,  1988,  p.212).  It  also  provides  the   "theoretical  and  conceptual  underpinning  for  many  of  the  general  policy  prescriptions"   (Thompson,  2008,  p.370).  Accordingly,  it  is  within  the  framework  of  Rational  Choice   Theory  that,  in  my  study,  I  will  use  the  outcomes  of  cross  tabulation  analysis  and   regression  analysis  as  elements  to  help  discern  the  preferences  of  those  who  define  the   wages  of  low-skilled  workers.  I  will  then  explore  the  effects  of  policy  changes  as  they   are  reflected  in  differences  in  wages  based  on  immigration  status  among  workers   working  in  the  same  occupations.        Without  undermining  its  analytic  value,  one  significant  limitation  of  Rational  

Choice  Theory  is  that  it  overlooks  power  dynamics  in  which  different  individuals  have   different  levels  of  "free"  choice.  As  a  result,  this  theory  is  blind  to  the  ethical  and   structural  issues  behind  decision-making  processes.        In  short:  Rational  Choice  Theory  has  a  detached  approach  to  social  phenomena;  

it  is  indifferent  to  human  values  (Harsanyi,  1969).  In  the  case  of  this  dissertation,  the   observation  of  wages  is  mathematically  analyzed  without  any  embedded  agenda.  The   mathematical  methods  (cross  tabulation  and  regression  analysis)  have  in  themselves   no  emancipatory  intentions;  they  simply  serve  an  analytic  function.  Given  that  wages   significantly  define  the  type  of  lives  people  live,  it  is  also  necessary  to  analyze  the   results  of  the  mathematical  analysis  with  a  human  lens,  that  is,  with  a  social  lens.   Critical  Social  Theory  provides  the  requisite  emancipatory  tools  (Harsanyi,  1969)  that   allow  a  critical  analysis  of  mathematical  outcomes.           2.2.2.  Critical  Social  Theory  (CST).  In  the  following  study,  the  analytical,  

29  

     

detached  work  stemming  from  RCT,  in  which  the  observer/analyst  is  removed  from  the   social  phenomenon,  is  complemented  with  CST,  which  explicitly  engages  social   phenomenon.  Critical  Social  theorists  "are  critical  of  what  they  see  as  pervasive   inequalities  and  injustices  in  everyday  social  relationships  and  arrangements"   (Freeman,  França  and  Vasconcelos,  2010,  p.7).  Stated  otherwise,  their  approach  to   social  analysis  addresses  moral  and  ethical  aspects  of  decision-making  (Johnson,   2005).  Critical  Social  Theory  provides  the  theoretical  tools  to  not  only  unveil  structures   of  injustice  that  may  affect  low-skilled  NPRs,  but  also  to  propose  ways  of  transforming   them.  The  following  is  a  brief  explanation  of  the  origin  and  tenets  of  this  theoretical   tradition.      Critical  Social  Theory  is  the  outcome  of  a  series  of  reflections  published  in  the  

1920s  by  members  of  the  Frankfurt  School,  originally  founded  by  the  Argentine  political   scientist  Felix  Weil  and  his  interest  in  the  intersection  of  Socialism  and  Marxism   (Freeman,  França  &  Vasconcelos,  2010).  Later  works  were  developed  by  Horkheimer,   Adorno  and  Marcuse  who  linked  Marx's  work  to  Hegel's  on  the  question  of  `determinate   negation,'  that  is,  of  moving  from  one  stage  of  consciousness  to  another  (Torres,  2012).   Determinate  negation  suggests  that  in  order  to  learn  something  new  I  must  negate  what   I  previously  held  for  certain.  According  to  Marx  (who  was  heavily  influenced  by  Hegel's   perception  of  humanity),  humanity  "creates  itself  through  labour,  loses  itself  in  estranged   labour  and  overcomes  alienation  through  re-appropriation  of  the  labour  process"   (Antonio,  1981,  p.333).  The  possibility  for  emancipation  in  Marx  relies  on  humans'   struggle  to  satisfy  basic  needs  (Antonio,  1981;  Arendt,  1998;  Torres,  2012).  Seen   historically,  social  structures  created  to  fulfill  basic  human  needs  displace  the  struggle  

30  

     

for  survival,  and  inadvertently  give  rise  to  complex  structures  of  production  that  end  up   exploiting  others.  Marx  argues  that  the  quest  for  emancipation  then  continues  in  our   reaction  to  such  exploitation  (Antonio,  1981).      In  its  emphasis  on  mechanisms  of  exploitation,  Critical  Social  Theory  offers  

strategies  for  recognizing  the  subtler  forms  of  oppression  enabled  by  advances  in   technology.  According  to  Herf  (2012),  in  their  book  Dialectic  and  Enlightenment,   Horkheimer  and  Adorno  (1946)  bring  to  light  how  modern  science  and  technological   development  become  means  for  dominating  humanity  and  nature,  referencing  the   holocaust  and  Nazism  as  paradigmatic  examples  of  this  phenomenon  (Herf,  2012).   From  this  critical  perspective,  modern  science  provides  a  new  structure  of  domination   that  masks  new  ways  of  exploitation  "characterized  by  `comfortable,  smooth,   reasonable,  democratic  unfreedom',  rather  than  the  crude,  direct  exploitation  of  early   industrial  capitalism"  (Antonio,  1981,  p.335).  Critical  theorists  also  offered  a  way  to   address  some  of  the  weaknesses  of  Marxism  (Marxist  reductionism),  by  replacing  "the   critique  of  political  economy  with  a  critique  of  instrumental  reason"  (Madiraju,  1996,   p.8).  Yet  concepts  including  "contradiction,  dialectics,  exploitation,  domination,  and   legitimation,"  (Torres,  2012,  p.118)  all  understood  to  serve  the  accumulation  of  capital,   remain  central  to  CST.        Further  highlighting  the  overlap  between  Hegel  and  Marx,  according  to  Torres  

(2012),  Marcuse  establishes  an  important  foundation  of  Critical  Social  Theory  by   interpreting  Marx's  negation  of  the  worker  and  the  worker's  labour  in  light  of  Hegel's   understanding  of  humans'  appropriation  of  the  intelligible  world  (objects  and  other   subjects  of  knowledge).  This  is  of  particular  relevance  to  this  dissertation,  which  directly  

31  

     

relates  to  Marx's  (and  by  extension,  Marcuse's)  concerns:   Marcuse  argues  that:  `The  traditional  epistemological  antagonism  between   subject  (consciousness)  and  object,  Hegel  makes  into  a  reflection  of  a  definite   historical  antagonism.  The  object  first  appears  as  an  object  of  desire,  something   to  be  worked  up  and  appropriated  in  order  to  satisfy  a  human  want.  In  the  course   of  the  appropriation,  the  object  becomes  manifest  as  the  ``otherness''  of  man'   (Marcuse  1941,  259).  This  Hegelian  premise  is  taken  up  by  Marx  who  would   argue  that:  `.  .  .  the  realization  of  labor  appears  as  negation  to  such  an  extent  that   the  worker  is  negated  to  the  point  of  starvation.  The  objectification  appears  as  a   loss  of  the  objects  to  such  an  extent  that  the  worker  is  deprived  of  the  most   necessary  objects  of  life  and  labor.  Moreover,  labor  itself  becomes  an  object  of   which  he  can  make  himself  master  only  by  the  greatest  effort  and  with   incalculable  interruption.  Appropriation  of  the  object  appears  as  alienation  to  such   an  extent  that  the  more  objects  the  worker  produces  the  less  he  possesses  and   the  more  he  comes  under  the  sway  of  his  product,  of  capital'  (cited  by  Marcuse   1941,  277)  (Torres,  2012,  p.117).      This  quotation  brings  to  the  fore  one  of  the  problems  of  capitalism,  which  is  exemplified   by  low-skilled  labour:  the  tendency  for  the  commodification  of  human  transformative   capacities  to  be  exploited  to  the  point  of  sacrificing  workers'  personal  wellbeing.  For   example,  an  agricultural  worker  whose  labour  would  be  more  than  sufficient  to  feed  their   family,  cannot  feed  his  family  even  though  he  works  beyond  the  point  of  exhaustion.  In   the  world  of  mass  production,  low-skilled  workers  have  no  other  choice  but  to  sell  their   transformative  capacity  and,  in  many  cases,  to  sell  it  under  exploitative  circumstances.      In  this  way,  CST  provides  critical  tools  for  understanding  processes  of  

oppression.  With  this  in  mind,  it  is  important  to  note  that  Critical  Social  Theory  is  a   theory  that  not  only  requires  acknowledging  a  prior  "original  state"  that  gave  rise  to   exploitation,  but  that  also  seeks  to  actively  "transform  it,"  by  creating  a  new  state  of   consciousness  (Torres,  2012).      In  line  with  this  tradition,  this  dissertation  will  provide  evidence  to  bring  about  new  

knowledge  based  on  critiquing  labour  conditions  of  low-skilled  temporary  foreign   32  
     

workers.  In  light  of  Adorno's,  Horkheimer's  and  Marcuse's  work,  Habermas  finds  in   Critical  Social  Theory  the  place  of  knowledge  creation  linked  to  social  action  (Scott,   1978).     As  will  be  shown  in  the  following  section,  along  with  RCT,  CST  is  regularly   embedded  in  different  theories  of  labour  migration.  While  the  literature  on  international   labour  migration  theories  is  quite  prolific,  the  following  section  is  based  primarily  on  two   key  pieces:  a  1993  article  written  by  Massey  et  al.,  entitled  Theories  of  International   Migration:  A  Review  and  Appraisal,  and  a  2013  book  by  Russell  King  called  Theories   and  Typologies  of  Migration:  An  Overview  and  a  Primer.  These  pieces  are  chosen   because  they  are  frequently  cited  in  articles  about  migration  theories;  most  of  the   theories  explored  appeal  to  either  rational  choice  or  social  critical  theory;  and  they  play   an  important  role  in  the  evolution  of  migration  theories.  Based  on  these  articles,  this   dissertation  uses  three  specific  migration  theories,  one  based  on  RCT  and  two  based   on  CST.      2.3.  Labour  Migration  Theories  in  Relation  to  RCT  and  CST        The  RCT-based  theory  informing  this  dissertation  is  Neoclassical  Economics  and  

Push-Pull  Theory.  The  additional  two  theories  (based  on  CST)  both  belong  to  the  group   of  theories  called  Historical-Structural  (Political-Economy  Based)  Theories  of  Migration,   which  include  Dual  Market  Theory  and  Segmented  Labour  Market  Theory.  Together,   these  theories  help  us  understand  the  experiences  of  low-skilled  NPRs  moving  to   Canada.

2.3.1.  Neoclassical  economics  and  Push-Pull  Theory.  Based  on  neoclassical  

principles,  push-pull  theories  focus  on  microeconomic  factors  related  to  one's   motivations  to  temporarily  depart  one's  homeland  and  then  return  (Budnik,  2011).  This   neoclassical  approach,  which  sees  migrants  as  rational  individuals  who  maximize  their   utility  and  move  according  to  push  and  pull  economic  factors,  is  at  the  heart  of   mainstream  econometric  analysis  of  labour  migration.  It  was  "developed  originally  to   explain  labor  migration  in  the  process  of  economic  development"  (Massey  et  al.,  1993)   and  views  migration  as  the  consequence  of  an  imbalance  of  labour  supply  and  demand   within  different  centres  of  production.  The  key  assumptions  of  this  approach  are  that:  1)   migration  depends  on  differentials  in  wages  and  unemployment  between  countries  of   origin  and  destination;  2)  an  individual's  characteristics  (social  capital,  human  capital,   socio-economic  conditions,  etc.)  influence  the  likelihood  to  move;  3)  migration  flows  are   the  aggregate  of  multiple  individuals'  cost-benefit  evaluations;  and  4)  governments   control  labour  inflows  through  migration  policies  (Massey  et  al.,  1993).      In  contrast  with  this  microeconomic  neoclassical  approach,  which  focuses  on  the  

individual  choices  of  migrants,  a  macroeconomics  neoclassical  approach  examines  the   distribution  of  labour  at  the  macro  level,  in  terms  such  as  the  abundance  or  scarcity  of   labour  in  different  countries  (Massey  et  al.,  1993).  The  key  assumptions  of  this   approach  include:  1)  migration  is  due  to  wage  differentials  between  countries/regions;  2)   if  controlled,  they  have  effects  on  levels  of  migration;  and  3)  high-skilled  labour   responds  to  returns  (compensation)  to  human  capital  (Massey  et  al.,  1993).      From  this  neoclassical  perspective,  labour  migration  is  a  way  of  optimizing  the  

redistribution  of  production  factors  in  a  way  that  benefits  both  sending  and  receiving  

34  

     

countries  (Haas,  2010).  Thus,  this  theory  highlights  geographic  differences  in  the  supply   and  demand  of  labour  (Massey  et  al.,  1993).  For  instance,  from  a  macro  perspective,   TFWs  from  Mexico  and  the  Caribbean  move  from  a  labour-abundant  location  to  one   that  is  scarce  in  labour.  To  be  mutually  beneficial  for  both  countries,  this  framework   requires  the  possibility  of  moving  to  and  remaining  in  the  country  of  destination.  For   example,  when  workers  leave  their  country  of  origin  for  higher  wages  abroad,  a   neoclassical  approach  highlights  how  this  decision  benefits  the  receiving  country  in   terms  of  cheap  labour  and  the  sending  country  in  terms  of  access  to  foreign  capital.19   Under  perfect  conditions,  a  neoclassicist  would  expect  this  dynamic  to  revert  when   labour  in  the  country  of  origin  is  scarce  and  wages  or  labour  conditions  improve.      Indeed,  a  neoclassical  approach  to  globalization  expects  a  mere  "global  

economic  convergence"  (McGrew,  2011,  p.270).  However,  this  principle  of  convergence   has  been  challenged,  as  has  the  expectation  that  migration  contributes  to  economic   stability.  Migration  has  been  shown  to  both  increase  and  decrease  international   economic  differences  (Termote,  1993).  This  neoclassical  approach  has  also  been   challenged  from  a  Marxist  perspective,  insofar  as  it  does  not  consider  the  structural  or   class  aspects  of  labour  migration.  In  fact,  Marx  would  call  the  neoclassical  approach  a   superstructure  that  rationalizes  and  thus  legitimates  migrant  labour  exploitation.  It  is   accordingly  helpful  to  complement  this  theory  with  the  following  perspectives,  which   acknowledge  structural  and  class  factors  that  influence  the  flow  of  migration.

2.3.2.  Historical  structural  theories  (neo-Marxist  based).  Before  engaging  this  

                                                                                                 
  Mexican  agricultural  workers  in  Canada,  for  example,  earn  in  eight  months  what  they  would  earn  in  five   years  in  Mexico  (Basok,  2000).       

35  

     

group  of  neo-Marxist  theories,  it  is  worth  examining  the  differences  between  traditional   Marxism  and  neo-Marxism,  the  latter  of  which  has  its  origins  in  the  Frankfurt  School  and   Critical  Social  Theory.  In  contrast  with  traditional  Marxism,  which  identifies  the   proletariat  as  the  source  for  change,  Neo-Marxists  are  concerned  with  the  dormant  state   of  the  working  class  and  "with  the  functioning  of  science  and  technology  as  instruments   of  domination"  (Antonio,  1981,  p.337).  While  classical  Marxism  approaches  labour   relations  in  a  capitalist  society  in  terms  of  a  market  economy  and  the  means  of   production  owned  by  private  hands  (Postone,  2005),  neo-Marxism  considers  economics   to  be  in  a  constant  process  of  evolution.  To  neo-Marxists,  the  economy  is  part  of  a   larger  cultural  process  (Gruchy,  1984).  Highlighting  this  difference,  Axel  Honneth,  a   successor  of  the  Frankfurt  School,  focuses  on  the  struggle  for  recognition  and   advocates  for  a  "broader  normative  theory  of  experiences  of  injustices  than  the  `more  or   less  utilitarian  anthropology'  of  Marxism"  (Therborn,  2006,  p.197).      Framed  within  a  neo-Marxist  approach  to  the  labour  market,  historical  structural  

theories  consider  migration  to  be  the  consequence  of  exploitative  structures  that  have   developed  throughout  history  to  allocate  some  people  on  top  and  some  people  at  the   bottom  of  a  hierarchical  labour  system.  Historical  Structural  Theory  suggests  that  the   current  situation  of  global  imbalances  in  labour  and  wages  is  a  consequence  of  our   colonial  past.      For  example,  Zolberg  (1991a)  traces  the  origins  of  the  use  of  low  skilled  foreign  

labour  in  slavery.  This  was  done  by  the  different  colonial  hegemons  in  history  (Spain,   France,  Portugal  and  England).  These  countries  at  the  time  required  low  skilled  labour   to  exploit  plantations  in  their  colonies,  which  gave  them  access  to  significant  richness  

36  

     

across  time  (and  space).  The  author  identifies  common  elements  that  permitted/eased   exploitation.  Factors  include  coercion  and  use  of  ethnically  different  labour.  After  slavery   became  controversial,  these  countries  continued  to  use  cheap  labour  but  now  in   indentured  ways.  For  example,  using  coercion  the  British  Empire  moved  peoples  mainly   from  India  and  China  across  its  colonies  to  continue  to  sustain  mainly  plantation   economies  and  development  of  projects  that  domestic  labour  would  not  do  (e.g.  railway   construction).  Zolberg,  explores  the  interaction  of  competing  forces  in  economic-political   systems  bounded  by:  institutions,  like  the  state  and  citizenship;  concepts,  like   sovereignty  and  identity;  and,  forms  of  labour  like  slavery  and  indentured  labour.   Zolberg  (1991b)  also  presents  the  role  the  nation  state  plays  domestically  and   internationally  in  setting  conditions  either  as  a  country  of  origin  or  as  a  country  of   destination  to  facilitate/restrict  the  movement  of  low  skilled  labour.  Ethnically  different   labour  was  not  originally--and  still  isn't--meant  to  be  given  the  opportunity  to  integrate   in  the  host  society.  All  these  are  constructed  as  key  elements  to  have  low  skilled  labour   captive  and  provide  cheap  labour  to  developed  countries.      These  theories  focus  on  socio-economic  imbalances  that,  on  a  global  scale,  

transform  workers  into  vulnerable  individuals  who  are  at  the  mercy  of  capitalism   (Gabriel  &  Pellerin,  2012).  Emphasizing  the  structural  mechanisms  of  oppression  that   influence  migration,  historical  structural  theories  tend  to  overlook  migrants'  potential  for   resilience,  self-determination,  and  decision-making,  dividing  the  world,  and  its  relations,   into  polarized  terms  with  clearly  demarcated  categories  (King,  2013).  They  also  fail  to   account  for  the  agency  that  countries,  both  at  the  periphery  and  at  the  core,  may  have   (via  elected  officials,  bureaucrats  and  institutions  of  the  state)  in  either  pulling  or  

37  

     

pushing  migrants  (King,  2013).  In  short,  they  overlook  the  aspects  brought  to  the  fore  by   neoclassical  push-pull  theories  of  migration.  Of  the  four  theories  grouped  under   historical  structural  theories  ­    Dual  Market  Theory,  Segmented  Labour  Market  Theory,   Dependency  Theory  and  the  World  Systems  Theory  (King,  2013)  ­  this  dissertation  will   draw  on  the  first  two.  These  theories  are  especially  relevant  for  understanding  low- skilled  temporary  foreign  migration  because  they  provide  a  theoretical  basis  to  unveil   structures  of  exploitation  affecting  low-skilled  NPRs.  
   The  Dual  Labour  Market  Theory  primarily  refers  to  different  kinds  of  jobs,  which  

can  be  framed  in  two  different  sectors  of  most  labour  markets,  each  holding  a  different   set  of  labour  conditions:  one  is  secure,  well  paid,  with  good  conditions,  and  is  mostly   reserved  for  citizens;  the  other  is  unprotected,  has  poor  labour  conditions  and  low   wages,  with  legal  holes  that  allow  exploitation  of  its  workers,  most  of  which  are  migrants   (Doeringer  &  Piore,  1971).  This  theory  is  considered  blind  to  the  economy  of  decision- making  at  the  level  of  individual  agents  (for  example,  the  decision  to  go  to  school  and   improve  skills,  which  may  result  in  a  change  of  sectors)  and  is  especially  suitable  for   examining  structures  of  imbalance  at  an  international  level  that  may  inform  experiences   of  low-skilled  NPRs  in  Canada.      The  Segmented  Labour  Market  Theory,  proposed  by  Edna  Bonacich  in  1972,  

has  close  ties  to  the  Dual  Labour  Market  Theory.  Both,  for  example,  highlight  the   demand-dependent  characteristic  of  labour  markets20  (King,  2013).  Rather  than   emphasize  the  different  kinds  of  jobs  on  the  market,  however,  the  Segmented  Labour   Market  Theory  focuses  on  intrinsic  characteristics  of  the  workers  themselves,  such  as   ethnic  origin,  that  are  used  to  differentiate  them.  According  to  Bonacich  (1972),  the

  By  this  King  means  that  labour  markets  depend  more  on  the  demand  of  labour  than  on  its  supply.

precursor  to  ethnic  antagonism  is  a  labour  market  split  along  ethnic  lines,  that  is,  a   labour  market  that  contains  at  least  two  groups  of  workers  being  paid  or  offered  different   prices  for  the  same  work.  From  this  perspective,  immigrants'  needs,  determined  by  their   individual  conditions,  are  systematically  exploited  to  establish  a  lower  price  for  their   labour  on  the  market.  At  an  international  level,  this  segmentation  occurs  along  lines  of   citizenship  and  culture  (Bauder,  2006),  a  consideration  that  is  particularly  relevant  for   this  dissertation,  which  compares  wages  of  workers  with  and  without  citizenship.      2.4.  Globalization  and  Neoliberalism      Other  key  factors  that  affect  the  lives  of  migrants  are  globalization  and  

neoliberalism,  two  phenomena  that  have  emerged  alongside  transnationalism  to   redefine  the  ways  in  which  immigration  policies  are  introduced.  Globalization  refers  to   the  global  integration  of  ideas,  policies,  cultures,  knowledge  as  well  as  the   establishment  of  a  global  economic  market  (Al-Rodhan,  2006)  and  neoliberalism  refers   to  the  neoclassical  principle  of  liberating  the  economy  from  any  kind  of  control,   especially  government-based.  Neoliberal  followers  advocate  for  the  privatization  of   public  goods,  the  de-regularization  of  markets,  and  a  general  strengthening  of  the   private  sector,  agendas  that  significantly  define  their  labour  experiences.  Following,  I   present  a  broad  overview  of  neoliberalism  in  relation  to  migration,  labour  and  citizenship   insofar  as  these  topics  relate  to  my  inquiry.      Neoliberalism  has  been  central  in  reshaping  economic  rules  and  transforming  

labour  conditions  on  a  global  scale.  From  a  neo-Marxist  perspective,  increases  in   temporary  foreign  labour  that  emerge  alongside  neoliberalism  are  related  to  the  state  

39  

     

using  its  power  to  more  aggressively  support  capital  through  policy  and  regulation  (or,   when  it  is  advantageous,  privatization  and  deregulation).  From  this  perspective,   expansion  of  low-skilled  TFW  programs  cannot  be  explained  without  considering  the   increase  of  state  intervention  that  is  needed  to  open  access  to  foreign,  vulnerable  low- skilled  labour.        As  a  series  of  policies  and  initiatives  beginning  in  the  1970s,  mainly  in  the  global  

North,  neoliberalism  functioned  to  boost  the  asymmetrical  accumulation  of  capital   (Glick-Schiller,  2011).  After  the  fall  of  the  Soviet  Union,  the  neoliberal  agenda  was   implemented  by  American  and  British  leadership  throughout  the  1980s  and  1990s.   Jessop  (2002)  identifies  three  forms  of  neoliberalism  stemming  from  this  agenda,  all   related  to  the  nature  of  accumulation  in  capitalism:  As  modulation  of  policies,  as   paradigm  shift  and  as  a  strategy  (Jessop,  2002,  p.458).  As  an  economic  project,  Jessop   (2002)  links  neoliberalism  with     the  liberalization  and  deregulation  of  economic  transactions,  not  only  within   national  borders  but  also--and  more  importantly--across  these  borders;  the   privatization  of  state-owned  enterprises  and  state-provided  services;  the  use  of   market  proxies  in  the  residual  public  sector;  and  the  treatment  of  public  welfare   spending  as  a  cost  of  international  production,  rather  than  as  a  source  of   domestic  demand  (p.454).        As  a  political  project,  neoliberalism  closely  associates  the  state  with  intervention  for  the   sake  of  capital  accumulation:   [neoliberalism]  seeks  to  roll  back  "normal"  (or  routine)  forms  of  state  intervention   associated  with  the  mixed  economy  and  the  Keynesian  welfare  national  state  (or   analogous  forms  of  intervention  in  the  developmental  state  or  socialist  plan  state)   as  well  as  the  "exceptional"  (or  crisis-induced)  forms  of  intervention  aimed  at   managing,  displacing,  or  deferring  crises  in  and/or  of  accumulation  regimes  and   their  modes  of  regulation  in  Atlantic  Fordism,  East  Asia,  and  elsewhere.  It  also   involves  enhanced  state  intervention  to  roll  forward  new  forms  of  governance   (including  state  intervention)  that  are  purportedly  more  suited  to  a  market-driven   40  
     

(and,  more  recently,  also  allegedly  knowledge-driven)  globalizing  economy.  This   typically  involves  the  selective  transfer  of  state  capacities  upwards,  downwards,   and  sideways,  as  intervention  is  rescaled  in  the  hope  of  securing  conditions  for  a   smoothly  operating  world  market  and  to  promote  supply-side  competitiveness  on   various  scales  above  and  below  the  national  level  (Jessop,  2002  p.454).  
  

The  market-  and  knowledge-driven  economic  aspects  identified  by  Jessop  directly   relate  to  the  state's  use  of  foreign  labour  although  it's  power  to  grant  rights  is  in  a  way   limited.  Global  neoliberalism  is  taking  away  the  power  states  have  to  grant  rights  even   to  their  own  nationals,  leaving  citizenship  mainly  as  a  means  for  a  romantic  sense  of   national  identity  (Somers,  2008a;  2008b).  Right  wing  groups  and  parties  across  Europe   (Askanius  &  Mylonas,  2015;  Ocak,  2016)  and  the  United  States  (Gokanksel  &  Smith,   2016)  harness  this  national  identity  (which,  in  many  cases,  is  interwoven  with  racism21)   and  mix  it  with  the  genuine  economic  dissatisfaction  derived  from  neoliberal  economic   policies.  Then  they  use  the  outcome  of  this  mix  against  non-citizens  living  in  their   countries  (refugees  and  migrants),  blaming  them  for  their  economic  misfortunes  in   recent  years  (Askanius  &  Mylonas,  2015;  Gokanksel  &  Smith,  2016;  Ocak,  2016).   According  to  Monbiot,  this  race-based  antagonism  functions  to  divert  attention  away   from  the  real  underlying  issues  inciting  the  anger  of  nationalists,  such  as  the  neoliberal   economic  policies  set  in  place  in  the  Reagan  and  Thatcher  era  in  the  1980s  (Monbiot,   2016).  In  fact,  neoliberal  economic  policies  are  the  root  causes  of  the  current  high  levels   of  unemployment  in  the  US  and  the  UK,  especially  among  low-skilled  white  workers  and   their  loss  of  privilege  in  society  (Inglehart  &  Norris,  2016).  They  also  played  a  significant   role  in  the  most  recent  world  financial,  political  and  economic  crises  (ex.  2008  Financial  
                                                                                                 
21

    Though  racism  undoubtedly  has  dynamics  and  roots  of  its  own,  in  recent  years  latent  and  dormant   racism  have  regularly  been  used  to  deflect  the  outcomes  of  neoliberal  policies  by  rejecting  those  outside   the  circle  of  belonging.

meltdown  and  Brexit)  (Inglehart  &  Norris,  2016).  Part  of  this  neoliberal  agenda  includes   the  use  of  a  lack  of  citizenship  to  access  and  create  a  need  for  foreign  labour  in  a   perennial  status  of  temporariness.      The  neoclassical  principles  of  Rational  Choice  Theory  maintain  that  migrants'  

decisions  are  based  on  their  desire  to  both  satisfy  basic  needs  and  ascend  the  social   ladder,  whether  within  the  context  of  their  country  of  origin  or  the  broader  global  context   (Nonimi,  2012).  From  the  structural-historical  perspective  provided  by  Critical  Social   Theory,  such  "decisions"  are  made  in  the  face  of  class-specific  dilemmas  that  migrants   face  and  are  circumscribed  by  the  various  regimes  that  regulate  their  labour  and  their   lives  (Nonimi,  2012).  Though  epistemologically  different,  both  perspectives  help  us   understand  the  effects  of  neoliberalism  on  policies  that  impact  the  experiences  of  low- skilled  temporary  foreign  workers.  Both  are  central  to  understanding  the  decision- making  processes  that  are  reached  at  the  level  of  policy  (Johnson,  2005).  Both  help   show  the  interplay  between  neoliberalism  and  policies  that  favour  the  increase  of   foreign  low-skilled  labour  in  Canada  and,  more  importantly,  help  illuminate  why  such   labour  is  likely  to  experience  lower  wages  than  low-skilled  CB  and  IMM.      While  approaching  a  state  of  global  governance,  humanity  still  can  have  a  

globalization  that  works  for  all.22  Nation-states  can  continue  to  trade  and  exchange,   each  dealing  with  the  inequality  brought  about  by  neoliberal  agendas.  However,  in  a   highly  competitive  world,  skills  and  prices  are  the  battleground,  the  former   predominantly  linked  to  high  skilled,  the  latter  to  low-skilled.  While  both  high-  and  low- skilled  foreign  labour  are  market  driven,  high-skilled  labour  is  associated  with  a

  In  its  purest  form,  the  policy  that  would  best  capture  this  is  a  complete  opening  of  all  borders.  While  we   are  not  yet  equipped  for  such  openness,  I  maintain  that  humanity  must  nevertheless  strive  toward  this   goal.

knowledge-market-driven  labour  and  low-skilled  labour  to  a  mere  market-driven  labour.   In  the  case  of  low-skilled  labour,  the  state  can  either  deregulate  or  regulate  the  market   to  remove  barriers  to  foreign  labour,  limiting  it  to  temporary  contracts  (i.e.  denying   access  to  a  permanent  status).  From  a  neo-Marxist  perspective,  the  flexibility   demanded  of  temporary  labourers  can  be  interpreted  as  the  outcome  of  economies   shaped  to  foster  the  accumulation  of  capital  at  the  expense  of  access  to  citizenship  and   rights.  Ideologies  that  appeal  to  the  promotion  of  individual  choice  at  the  expense  of   collective  choice  have  been  central  to  the  neoliberal  project  (Badie,  1993),  as  has  the   transformation  of  labour  migration  from  permanent  to  temporary,  flexible  and  without   mobility  in  the  labour  market.  Exploitation  is  part  of  the  mode  of  production  that  requires   labour  immobility,  denial  of  workplace  protections  and  the  right  to  unionize,  all  to  the   benefit  of  capital  accumulation  (United  Food  and  Commercial  Workers  Union,  2015).        In  Canada,  the  Harper  government`s  outlook  was  articulated  through  a  specific  

alignment  of  neoliberal  agendas,  strategies  and  structures.  This  means  of  power  took   place  through  specific  instruments  related  to  the  state,  including  specific  political   regimes  and  policy  instruments  (Jessop,  2012),  like  TFW  programs.  In  this  respect,  the   neoliberal  agenda  of  the  Harper  government  was  considered  extreme:  "His  efforts  to   bring  in  free-market  environmentalism  and  a  new  land-ownership  regime  for  First   Nations  are  radical,  not  conservative.  The  agenda  is  to  create  and  enforce  markets,   often  where  they  didn't  exist  before.  Such  major  transformation  of  Canadian  society   must  be  undertaken  incrementally  so  they  don't  look  like  revolution"  (Gutstein,  2014,   p.245).  Part  of  that  transformation  included  the  expansion  of  low-skilled  temporary   foreign  worker  programs.

The  Program  for  Occupations  Requiring  Lower  Levels  of  Formal  Training  was  

formed  in  2001  in  response  to  demands  of  the  oil  and  gas  industry  in  Alberta  and  the   construction  sector  in  Toronto  (Faraday,  2012a).  Initially  known  as  the  Low-Skilled  Pilot   Project,  this  program  permits  employers  to  access  the  vast  global  pool  of  low-skilled   workers,  primarily  those  working  in  the  construction,  manufacturing,  service  and   agriculture  industries  (Hughes,  2012).        As  with  Live-In  Caregivers,  workers  who  participate  in  the  Program  for  

Occupations  Requiring  Lower  Levels  of  Formal  Training  leave  families  behind,  which   has  a  direct  impact  on  the  entire  social  fabric  of  the  sending  countries  (Palacio,  2010).   Nevertheless,  many  countries  promote  the  opportunity  to  work  abroad.  In  response  to   global  neoliberal  policies  from  the  1970s  and  1980s,  for  example,  countries  like  the   Philippines  established  programs  that  encouraged  their  citizens  to  emigrate  (Law  and   Nadeau,  1999).  Much  of  the  migrant  labour  force  is  increasingly  transformed  into  a   flexible  work  force  that  can  respond  to  labour  constraints  and  meet  employer's  interests   in  a  timely  way.    
  

2.5.  Citizenship  and  Low-skilled  Labour      Since  the  presence  of  low-skilled  NPRs  in  Canada  takes  place  within  legal  

frameworks  validated  by  citizenship,  it  is  helpful  to  review  theoretical  analyses  of   citizenship,  which  highlight  how  a  lack  of  citizenship  enables  exploitation  and  injustice.   This  dissertation  examines,  from  a  theoretical  perspective,  how  a  lack  of  citizenship  has   provided  a  means  to  bring  in  low-skilled  foreign  labourers  and  how  their  status  as   noncitizens  simultaneously  renders  them  highly  vulnerable  and  exploitable.  This  section   initially  presents  the  literature  on  the  relation  between  citizenship  and  low-skilled   44  
     

temporary  foreign  labour  in  Canada,  and  then  moves  to  the  broader  understanding  of   citizenship  in  relation  to  the  nation-state.      An  overview  of  the  literature  highlights  the  ways  in  which  a  lack  of  citizenship  

impacts  temporary  foreign  workers  in  Canada.23  Gabriel  and  Macdonald  (2011)  focus  on   SAWs'  lack  of  citizenship  rights  and  reduced  labour  protection.  Reed  (2008)  references   the  case  of  Canadian  temporary  foreign  worker  programs  to  expose  how  citizenship  is   used  to  control  both  migration  and  immigration.  Her  research  examines  how  controlled   international  labour  migration  functions  to  create  a  permanent  source  of  temporary   foreign  labour,  such  as  the  SAWP  and  LIC  programs.  Nakache  and  Kinoshita  (2010)   reflect  upon  both  Canadian  and  Albertan  structures  for  protecting  TFWs.  In  a  similar   vein,  Faraday  (2012a)  presents  and  critiques  the  legal  terms  and  conditions  that   surround  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  worker  programs  in  Canada.  More  specifically,   she  engages  in  a  "critical  analysis  of  the  federal  and  provincial  laws  that  regulate  and   constrain  the  rights  of  low-wage  migrant  workers,  proposes  a  rights-based  framework  to   assess  their  treatment,  identifies  the  ways  in  which  the  law  constructs  migrant  workers'   insecurity  through  each  stage  of  the  labour  migration  cycle,  and  examines  options  for   systemic  change  to  increase  workers'  security"  (Faraday,  2012a,  p.3).        In  her  latest  work,  Faraday  (2016)  reviews  the  conditions  of  low-skilled  workers  

after  changes  to  the  TFW  program  were  set  in  place  in  201424  (and  that  will  be

  While  some  works  explore  Provincial  and  Territorial  Nominee  Programs  (PTNPs)  as  a  possible   instrument  for  low-skilled  workers  to  gain  citizenship  (Canadian  Federation  of  Independent  Businesses,   2014;  Faraday,  2016;  Nakache  &  D'aoust,  2102;  Palacio,  2010)  others  evaluate  the  relations  between   TFW  programs  and  the  PTNPs  (Carter,  2012).   24   In  June  2014,  Immigration,  Refugees  and  Citizenship  Canada  -  IRCC  (formerly  known  as  Citizenship   and  Immigration  Canada  -  CIC)  changed  the  Temporary  Foreign  Worker  Program.  Under  the  new   program  temporary  foreign  workers  (TFWs)  correspond  only  to  those  coming  under  the  Temporary   Foreign  Worker  Program  (i.e.  requiring  Labour  Market  Impact  Assessment  -  LMIA).  Those  not  requiring   LMIAs  are  now  called  International  Mobility  Program  workers  -  IMP.  The  LMIA  is  a  document  that

discussed  in  more  detail  in  chapter  three).  This  report  is  a  continuation  to  her  2012   report  "Made  in  Canada:  How  the  Law  Constructs  Migrant  Workers'  Insecurity,"  which   focuses  on  the  common  experiences  of  exploitation  that  cut  across  all  low-skilled   temporary  labour  workers,  which  make  it  evident  that  "exploitation  is  not  isolated  and   anecdotal.  It  is  endemic"  (Faraday,  2012b,  p.5).  Her  2016  report  shows  that  instead  of   addressing  previously  identified  instances  of  exploitation,  the  changes  introduced  in   2014  to  the  TFW  policy  have  further  intensified  the  exploitation  of  low-wage  temporary   foreign  workers.  The  report  introduces  three  narratives  present  throughout  TFW  policy:   (1)  some  workers'  contributions  merit  a  pathway  to  citizenship,  while  others  do  not;  (2)   some  workers  can  bring  their  families,  while  others  cannot;  and  (3)  some  forms  of   labour  are  linked  to  a  "commitment  to  developing  a  sustainable  labour  force  with  secure   status;  other  forms  of  work  are  treated  as  `zones  of  exceptionality.'  These  zones  foster   an  enduring  and  expanding  reliance  on  low-wage  labour  with  temporary  status  and   conditions  that  `Canadians'  are  `unwilling  to  accept'"  (Faraday,  2016,  p.7).        The  literature  also  reveals  how  a  lack  of  citizenship  disqualifies  low-skilled  TFWs  

from  language  acquisition  programs,  which  would  significantly  help  them  become  aware   of  their  rights  (Preibisch  &  Binford,  2007)  and,  by  extension,  help  make  their  labour   conditions  more  humane.  From  this  perspective,  citizenship  can  be  viewed  as  a   mechanism  of  "differential  inclusion,"  (Foster  &  Barnetson,  2015,  p.110)  that  is,  those   who  possess  it  have  the  "privilege"  to  claim  greater  rights  than  those  who  do  not   (Castles  &  Miller,  2009;  Lister  1997;  Stasiulis  &  Bakan,  2005  as  cited  in  Foster  &  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
assesses  whether  a  temporary  foreign  worker  is  indeed  needed  and  whether  it  affects  the  Canadian   labour  market.  Additionally,  in  January  2015,  CIC  introduced  a  new  way  of  counting  temporary  residents   st st (TFWs  included).  This  new  methodology  counts  stock  not  on  December  1   but  on  December  31 .  With   this  new  methodology,  some  low-skilled  workers  may  not  be  counted,  since  they  will  have  already  left  by   the  end  of  the  month.

Barnetson,  2015,  p.110).      Finally,  the  literature  demonstrates  how  difficult  it  is  to  reform  the  systematic  

oppression  that  surrounds  the  denial  of  citizenship.  It  details  the  challenges  faced  by   advocacy  groups  fighting  for  citizenship  rights  or  other  legal  privileges  related  to   accessing  human  rights.  As  Basok  reports,  advocacy  groups  face  the  challenge  of   "counter-hegemonic  human  rights  values,  the  ones  that  in  one  way  or  another  challenge   the  status  quo,  either  by  undermining  the  political  economic  foundations  of  liberal   democracies  and/or  the  principles  of  national  sovereignty"  (Basok,  2009,  p.184).   Triadafilopoulos'  (2011)  analysis  of  the  use  of  illiberal  means  to  achieve  liberal  ends  in   immigration  policy  in  Europe  could  be  compared  with  Canadian  policy's  characterization   of  low-skilled  workers.  While  Europe's  approach  is  deemed  problematic  for  its   reductionist  characteristics,  Canada's  is  also  problematic  for  its  way  of  using  the  socially   constructed  meanings  of  skills  and  race  as  means  to  maintain  the  low-skilled  in  a   revolving  door  of  temporariness.  Canada  sees  low-skilled  workers  as  the  `undesirable'   others  for  citizenship  because  of  their  lack  of  human  capital-based  skills.  Piché  et  al.   (2006)  identify  the  main  obstacles  preventing  Canada  from  signing  the  International   Convention  on  the  Protection  of  the  Rights  of  All  Migrant  Workers  and  Members  of  Their   Families.  Additionally,  it  is  argued  that  if  granted  citizenship,  agricultural  workers  are   likely  to  move  to  other  industries  and  the  seasonality  of  their  labour  generates   uncertainty  surrounding  their  off-season  labour  activities.  Some  alternatives  have  been   proposed,  including  citizenship  tied  to  the  agricultural  industry  for  a  determined  period   (Hennebry,  2012;  Palacio,  2010),  offseason  training  activities  paid  by  employers  and  the   various  levels  of  government  involved  (Palacio,  2010);  and,  working  in  industries  suited

for  the  offseason  period  (ex.  winter-related  activities  including  snow  removal).  
  

2.6.  Citizenship  and  the  nation-state.        The  current  understanding  of  citizenship  in  Canada  derives  from  ancient  

developments  of  the  city  states  in  ancient  Greece  (Arendt,  1998).  For  more  than  a   millennium,  the  meaning  of  the  relationship  between  collective  and  individuals   (citizenship)  has  been  expanding.  In  the  mid-18th  century,  for  example,  Prussia  (part  of   today's  Germany)  officially  formalized  belonging  via  citizenship.  This  was  the  outcome   not  only  of  control  of  movement  on  its  territory  but  also  of  unification  of  various  levels  of   sovereignty  of  cities  and  regions,  which  at  the  time  operated  with  a  certain  degree  of   autonomy  (Torpey,  2000).  Today  we  have  a  system  that  associates  citizenship  with   nation-states  interacting  within  a  system  of  other  nation-states  (Sassen,  2003).  Although   both  citizenship  and  nationality  speak  of  belonging,  citizenship  points  to  an  intra-borders   relationship  with  the  nation-state  and  nationality  to  the  system  of  nations  (Sassen,   2003).  In  the  Canadian  context,  citizenship  (or  lack  thereof)  should  be  seen  from  a  lens   of  relations  between  Canada  and  the  countries  in  the  periphery  that  provide  it  with   foreign  low-skilled  labour.      In  view  of  the  incredible  impact  that  access  to  citizenship  (or  lack  thereof)  has  on  

the  lives  of  those  working  and  living  outside  of  their  country  of  origin,  it  is  important  to   consider  what  exactly  citizenship  means  and  its  relationship  with  the  nation-state.  In  the   most  general  terms,  citizenship  may  be  understood  as  the  relations  of  membership  an   individual  has  with  a  political  community.  These  relations  are  expressed  through  rights,   duties,  identities  and  public  participation  (Delanty,  2000,  as  cited  in  Lister  &  Pia,  2008).   Stated  otherwise,  citizenship  provides  access  to  identity,  legal  status,  rights,  and   48  
     

participation  (Bloemraad,  2000;  2006;  Isin  &  Wood,  1999;  Lister  &  Pia,  2008).  It  also   unites  people  who  share  a  set  of  common  cultural  traits,  who  live  in  a  bordered  territory   and  who  are  part  of  a  polity  that  rules  itself  (Castles,  2005).  And  yet,  the  meaning  of   citizenship  goes  beyond  identity  and  nationhood;  it  also  defines  the  actual  lives  of  many   human  beings  via  their  labour  conditions.  As  has  already  been  elaborated,  the  literature   on  migration  in  Canada  shows  that  a  lack  of  citizenship  represents  a  barrier  to  better   labour  conditions,  to  increased  wages  and  to  further  social  integration  (Faraday,  2016).   Conversely,  understood  as  the  negation  of  the  rights  and  freedoms  associated  with   citizenship,  temporary  foreign  workers'  status  as  noncitizens  means  that  they  have  a   constrained  legal  status  and  limited  rights  and  participation.  Some  attempts  to  improve   inclusion  of  TFWs  focus  on  transnational  political  activities  and  possibilities  of  inclusion   that  extend  beyond  the  nation-state.  Post-national  citizenship  is  an  attempt  to  separate   rights  from  identity  (Soysal,  2006).  It  contends  that  immigrants  moving  to  a  country   different  than  their  country  of  birth  should  be  granted  rights  based,  not  on  their  national   identify,  which  continues  to  be  linked  to  the  geographic  limits  of  the  nation-state  (Soysal,   2006),  but  rather  on  the  ideals  of  universal  rights.  This  post-national  understanding  of   citizenship  emerges  in  response  to  the  rise  of  transnational  political  structures,  which   render  obsolete  models  of  citizenship  tied  to  the  sovereignty  of  the  nation-state  (Lister  &   Pia,  2008).  As  such,  it  could  be  considered  as  a  means  of  proposing  new  ways  to   extend  inclusion  to  low-skilled  TFWs  working  in  Canada.        Post-national  citizenship  invokes  the  "de-territorialisation  of  citizenship  practices  

and  identities"  (Lister  &  Pia,  2008)  and  has  been  proposed  in  response  to:  experiences   of  exclusion,  violation  or  lacking  access  to  rights  (Carens,  2008),  especially  experienced  

49  

     

by  agricultural  migrant  workers  (Basok,  2003;  2004;  2006a;  2010);  the  active  role  of   citizens  and  global  organizations  in  improving  global  wellbeing  (Basok,  2006b);  and  the   role  of  advocacy  at  the  international  level  in  the  quest  towards  rights  and  justice  for   migrant  workers  (Basok,  2009;  Hanley  &  Shragge,  2009).  Advocates  of  post-national   citizenship  question  the  actual  validity  of  borders  and  consider  the  trade-offs  of  opening   borders  (Carens,  1987;  2000;  Sharma,  2012).  Some  contend  that  national  identity,   circumscribed  by  geopolitical  borders,  is  little  more  than  a  means  for  social  exclusion   and  an  enabler  of  global  capitalism  (Sharma,  2012).  Others  argue  that  the  nation-state   is  losing  control  of  its  responsibility  to  provide  "equality,  liberty  and  civic  participation"   (Tambini,  2001,  p.200).  Indeed,  the  nation-state  is  facing  forces  from  within  and  from   without  (for  example,  global  economies,  immigration,  social  media,  communications,   terrorism,  etc.)  that  challenge  its  sovereignty.  In  the  words  of  Keating,  challenges  to  the   integrity  of  the  nation-state  come  "from  above  and  below,  and  also  by  the  market"   (Keating  1998,  p.10,  as  cited  in  Tambini,  2001,  p.200).        In  view  of  those  who  have  been  depoliticized  by  unjust  policies  of  labour  

migration,  appeals  to  post-national  citizenship  tend  to  focus  on  the  global  rather  than   the  local  (i.e.  the  nation-state)  as  the  space  for  re-politicization  (Bauder,  2006).  While   this  view  is,  in  my  opinion,  the  final  goal,  at  this  point  in  history  it  remains  unreachable;   we  are  in  an  "in-between"  state.  Although  influences  from  within  and  without  have   eroded  national  borders,  the  world  is  nevertheless  still  ruled  within  the  confines  of  the   nation-state25.  I  accordingly  advocate  a  theory  of  re-politicization  that  is  crafted  within   the  nation-state  but  aims  at  future  global  citizenship  (i.e.  global  mobility)  as  the  most  
                                                                                                 
25

  There  are  also  local  initiatives,  such  as  sanctuary  cities,  that  contravene  nation  state  policies  and  may   be  interpreted  as  outside  the  rulings  of  the  nation-state.  

50  

     

desirable.  Such  an  approach  demands  that  we  look  for  solutions  not  outside  the  nation- state,  but  rather  within  its  borders26  (Bauböck,  2001a).  That  is,  the  focus  should  be  on   those  lacking  citizenship,  whose  presence  questions  the  way  political  communities  are   constituted  (Bauböck,  2000).        When  it  comes  to  granting  rights  to  foreign  nationals,  three  kinds  of  rights  frame  

the  debate:  civil,  political  and  social  rights  (Marshall,  1973,  as  cited  in  Evans,  1998).   Social  rights,  which  are  the  focus  of  this  study,  involve  the  right  to  seek  employment  in   an  occupation  of  preference;  basic  economic  and  welfare  rights  and  protections;  as  well   as  access  to  education  (Evans,  1998).  
  

2.7.  Theories  of  the  State,  a  Neo-Marxist  Perspective      Insofar  as  the  state  uses  citizenship  (or  a  lack  thereof)  as  a  means  for  

maintaining  economic  conditions  that  favour  its  interests,  or,  conversely,  protect  migrant   workers,  an  interest  in  temporary  foreign  workers  in  Canada  prompts  us  to  turn  to   theories  of  the  state.  The  following  theories  of  state  are  framed  within  Critical  Social   Theory  and,  hence,  are  supported  by  neo-Marxist  analysis.  More  specifically,  they  draw   on  the  analysis  of  state  provided  by  Bob  Jessop.        Considering  the  state  and  its  origins  is  relevant  to  understanding  these  patterns  

because,  as  it  will  be  further  explained,  the  state  is  the  place  where  different  forces  and   powers  converge  to  affect  the  labour  market  experiences  of  low-skilled  workers.  While   the  origin  of  states  can  be  traced  back  thousands  of  years  to  when  wars  and  means  of   food  production  were  the  primary  means  of  power  and  dominance  (Herb,  1999),  the   world  as  we  currently  know  it  began  to  be  shaped  in  large  part  by  the  Westphalia  peace

  Within  the  current  structure,  this  type  of  initiatives  would  be  of  federal  domain.

agreement  in  1648,  which  brought  an  end  to  the  Christian  wars  (Palacio,  2009).  It  is   worth  mentioning  that  the  treaties  of  Westphalia  established  the  precedent  for  the   autonomy  and  independence  of  sovereign  states.  However,  the  nation-state  and   nationalism  only  began  to  fully  form  in  the  second  half  of  the  19th  century,  when  the   state  and  its  power  started  to  be  identified  with  a  given  nation.      Jessop  (a  Neo-Marxist  theorist)  identifies  three  characteristics  of  the  state:  a  

territory  controlled  by  that  state;  a  structure  that  makes  collectively  binding  decisions;   and  all  residents  who  are  subject  to  state  authority  (Jessop,  2014;  2010).  While  all   sovereign  states  theoretically  have  equal  rights  on  the  global  stage,  in  reality  the   asymmetrical  distribution  of  power  and  resources  governs  the  flow  of  capital,   information  and  people      In  their  structural  understanding  of  power,  neo-Marxists  distinguish  themselves  

from  behaviourists  and  conservatives/liberals,  who  posit  power  as  something  concretely   installed  in  specific  people.  From  a  behaviourist  perspective,  for  example,  Dahl  (1957)   centers  power  analysis  on  the  persons  involved  in  a  particular  issue.  Dahl  defines   power  as  "A  has  power  over  B  to  the  extent  that  he  can  get  B  to  do  something  that  B   would  not  otherwise  do"  (Dahl,  1957,  p.203).  Gelb  (2009)  identifies  a  similarly  localized   understanding  of  power  operative  in  conservative/liberal  worldviews.  While   conservatives  have  an  individualistic  worldview  that  frames  power  as  military  might,   liberals  understand  power  as  based  on  others'  perception  of  factors  including  leadership   and  communications  (Gelb,  2009,  p.27).      In  contrast,  in  a  neo-Marxist  analysis,  class  power  is  foundational  to  

understanding  processes  of  labour  and  social  interactions  of  production  in  relation  to  the  

52  

     

state  (Jessop,  2011).  All  power  relations  are  considered  within  the  broader  context  of   the  power  that  is  installed  in  structures  of  class  domination  and  relations  of  power   across  factors  including  economics,  politics,  and  ideologies  (Jessop,  2012).  Rather  than   being  localized  in  particularly  powerful  individuals,  from  a  neo-Marxist  perspective,   power  is  economically  rooted  in  very  concrete,  tangible  capacities  located  "in  the  social   relations  of  production,  in  control  over  the  state,  or  in  intellectual  hegemony  over  hearts   and  minds"  (Jessop,  2012,  p.4).            2.7.1.  Class  domination  and  the  state:  economics  and  politics.  In  the  social  

relations  of  production,  `economic  class  domination'  refers  to  "social  control  over  the   allocation  of  resources  to  different  productive  activities  and  over  the  appropriation  of  any   resulting  surplus"  (Jessop,  2012,  p.5).  In  this  context,  Jessop  identifies  three  modes  of   control:  bureaucratic,  technical  and  despotic,  each  affecting  the  distribution  of  power   between  the  capital  and  labour  in  different  ways.  In  view  of  these  mechanisms  of   control,  we  can  better  understand  the  formation  of  policies  concerning  low-skilled   workers,  which,  in  turn,  account  for  wage  differentials.      In  what  Jessop  calls  a  "bourgeois  democracy,"  that  is,  a  democracy  in  which  the  

bourgeoisie  make  up  the  dominant  class  ­  a  characteristic  of  a  capitalist  state  ­   economic  class  domination  is  indicative  of  the  way  in  which  the  bourgeoisie  are  taxed:   for  the  bourgeoisie  (transnational  companies),  taxes  are  the  subject  of  political   negotiation  and  are  linked  to  their  global  privileges  (Jessop,  2014).  In  this  theory,  taxes   are  relevant  because  they  are  one  of  the  most  evident  links  between  economics  and   politics.  While  the  separation  of  economics  from  the  political  is  desirable,  it  is  not  really  

53  

     

feasible  in  a  capitalist  state.  In  view  of  this  difficulty,  Jessop,  drawing  on  the  early  work   of  John  Hallowell,  suggests  that  a  state  should  instead  strive  for  a  separation  in  unity   instead  of  a  total  separation27  (Jessop,  2014).      Class  domination  not  only  influences  economics;  it  is  also  political.  That  is,  the  

state  ensures  economic  class  domination  through  political  dominance  (Jessop,  1982;   2012).  Jessop  accordingly  understands  statehood  as  "territorialized  political  power"   (Jessop,  2009,  p.92).  The  state  fills  the  gaps  resulting  from  failures  in  the  market  and   barriers  to  capital  accumulation.  It  also  regulates  the  different  interests  at  play  and   manages  the  consequences  derived  from  any  exploitation  that  may  arise  (Jessop,   1982).  For  example,  in  the  case  of  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  workers,  the  state  has   responded  to  complaints  of  exploitative  conditions,  but  only  when  the  pressure  was   sufficiently  high  (Faraday,  2016)28.        Political  class  domination  is  of  special  interest  to  this  dissertation  because  the  

demand  for  foreign  low-skilled  labour  in  Canada  has  been  primarily  constructed  via   political  actions  (Bauder,  2005).      Jessop  identifies  three  approaches  Marxist  theorists  use  to  consider  the  state  

politically:  instrumentalist,  structuralist,  and  `strategic-relational'  (Jessop,  1982;  2012).   According  to  instrumentalists,  an  instrumentalist  view  of  the  state  is  indispensable  in   capitalist  societies,  which  are  characterized  by  ruling  classes  using  the  state  through  
                                                                                                 
27

  In  the  current,  capitalistic,  world,  economics  is  relevant  to  policymaking.  However,  economics  has  a   role  (a  very  important  one)  in  society  that  should  not  be  used  as  a  means  to  power  (via  politics).   Economics  in  relation  to  politics  needs  to  be  reframed,  perhaps  around  Amartya  Sen's  (1977)  tenets  of   self-interest,  empathy  (via  unselfishness)  and  commitment,  "assessed  in  terms  of  one's  values  and   instincts"  (Sen,  1977,  p.344).  Sen  presents  these  three  values  as  the  foundation  of  decision-making,  as   opposed  to  mere  self-interest  (in  a  vacuum)  as  argued  by  the  first  rational  choice  theorists.      28   As  will  be  explained  in  chapter  three,  in  2014  the  federal  government  introduced  legislation  to  regulate   TFWs  in  Canada  because  of  two  principal  pressures:  a  rapid  increase  in  the  use  of  foreign  labour  and   exploitation  (Faraday,  2016).  

54  

     

their  economic  power  to  dominate  society.  From  an  instrumentalist  perspective,  Marx   and  Engels  see  the  state  as  a  political  subject  that  lacks  autonomy,  that  is,  as  "an   instrument  of  coercion  and  administration  which  can  be  used  for  various  purposes  by   whatever  interests  manage  to  appropriate  it"  (Jessop,  1982,  p.12).  Different  theoretical   streams  of  thought  have  approached  Marx's  stance  on  the  state,  from  an  instrumental   perspective.  Neo-Ricardian  theorists,  for  example,  see  the  state  as  an  instrument  of   capital  "through  its  interventions  to  maintain  or  restore  profits  at  the  expense  of  wages"   (Jessop,  1982,  p.14).  The  `stamocap'  (state,  monopoly,  capitalism)  theorists  also  fall  into   this  category,  highlighting  the  convergence  between  the  state  and  monopolies  (Jessop,   1982).      Jessop  argues  that  a  strictly  instrumental  view  of  the  state  makes  it  necessary  to  

think  of  the  state  as  "non-partisan  and  passive  in  its  personnel  and  orientation"  (Jessop,   1982,  p.15).  It  also  makes  it  difficult  to  account  for  the  reproduction  of  dominant  modes   of  production  when  the  "dominant  class  does  not  actually  occupy  the  key  positions  in   the  state  system"  (Jessop,  1982,  p.15).  It  similarly  loses  explanatory  force  when  those   running  the  state  not  only  have  independence  from  the  dominant  class  but  also  actively   distance  themselves  from  it.      In  a  structuralist  interpretation  of  the  state,  capitalism  relates  to  the  state  not  

instrumentally,  but  essentially.  Essentially  capitalistic,  the  state  accomplishes  its  mission   by  "organizing  capital  and  disorganizing  the  working  class"  (Offe,  1984  as  cited  in   Jessop,  2012,  p.7).  Under  these  conditions  capital  needs  to  be  as  politically  strong  as   possible  without  undermining  the  state's  legitimacy.      In  contrast,  the  state  can  also  be  understood  as  a  factor  of  cohesion.  Marx  and  

55  

     

Engels  "suggest  that  the  conquest  of  the  state  power  presupposes  the  successful   representation  of  a  class  interest  as  the  general  interest"  (Jessop,  1982,  p.17).  Engels   argued  that  this  is  the  regulator  of  differences  between  polar  classes,  keeping  them   "within  the  bounds  of  social  order"  (Jessop,  1982,  p.18).  Challenging  this  reading,   Jessop  notes  that  "while  the  state  must  appear  to  stand  above  society  and  keep  class   antagonism  in  check,  it  is  normally  the  state  of  the  most  powerful,  economically   dominant  class"  (Jessop,  1982,  p.18).  He  believes  that  this  is  a  function  of  the  fact  that   class  function  overrides  social  functions  and  he  accordingly  understands  the  state  as  a   "distinct  ensemble  of  institutions  and  organizations  socially  constructed  and  [whose]   accepted  `function'  is  to  define  and  enforce  collectively  binding  decisions  on  members  of   a  society  in  the  name  of  their  common  interests  or  the  general  will"  (Jessop  2014).  This   brings  us  to  the  third  approach.      The  strategic-relationist  approach  (advanced  mainly  by  Nicos  Poulantzas  and  

Bob  Jessop),  uses  Marx's  observation  that  the  state  "is  not  a  thing  but  a  social  relation"   (Jessop,  2012,  p.7).  According  to  Jessop,  "Marx  showed  how  continued  reproduction  of   the  material  and  institutional  forms  of  the  capital  relation  shaped  the  dynamic  of  capital   accumulation  and  the  economic  class  struggle  ­  but  the  dominance  of  these  forms   could  not  in  and  of  itself  guarantee  capital  accumulation"  (Jessop,  2012,  p.8).  This  is  the   main  approach  used  by  Jessop  and  the  approach  that  most  directly  informs  the   discussion  of  my  results.  As  such,  it  will  be  following  elaborated  in  more.         2.7.2.  The  Strategic  Relational  Approach,  a  Definition  of  the  State.  Through  

its  Strategic  Relational  Approach  (SRA),  Jessop's  work  continues  the  neo-Marxist  

56  

     

theorization  of  the  state  initiated  by  Poulantzas  after  his  early  death  in  1978  (Marinetto,   2007).  Although  Jessop's  work  is  based  primarily  on  Poulantzas'  contributions,  it  also   incorporates  elements  from  other  thinkers,  such  as  Gramsci  (Carlassare,  2010).   Drawing  on  Nicos  Poulantzas  and  Gramsci,  advancing  the  strategic-relationist  approach   is  Jessop's  main  contribution  to  the  theory  of  state.  This  approach  elaborates  Marx's   observation  that  the  state  "is  not  a  thing  but  a  social  relation"  (Jessop,  2012,  p.7).   According  to  Jessop  (2012),   Marx  showed  how  continued  reproduction  of  the  material  and  institutional  forms   of  the  capital  relation  shaped  the  dynamic  of  capital  accumulation  and  the   economic  class  struggle  ­  but  the  dominance  of  these  forms  could  not  in  and  of   itself  guarantee  capital  accumulation.  This  depended  on  capital's  success  in   maintaining  its  domination  over  the  working  class  in  production,  politics,  and  the   wider  society.  (p.7)  
  

From  this  perspective,  Jessop  emphasizes  capital's  domination  not  only  over  production   but  also  over  politics  and  the  wider  society.  Indeed,  capital  has  been  successful  in   supporting  political  agendas  that  not  only  contribute  to  capital  accumulation  but  also   affect  the  social  fabric  of  society,  like  temporary  foreign  labour.  The  state  facilitates   capital's  domination.  Likewise,  the  state's  dominance  is  activated  via  the  politicians  and   bureaucrats  that  rule  it  (Jessop,  2012),  according  to  their  ideologies29.  The  history  of   temporary  foreign  labour  policy  in  Canada  shows  that  bureaucrats'  have  been  a  mix  of   gatekeepers  and  non-neutral  policy  brokers  between  elected  officials  and  different   forces  at  play  (Satzewich,  2008)  but,  that  power  is  something  that  has  been  challenged

  While  ideologies  often  play  a  significant  role  in  influencing  policy,  policymakers  often  look  for  strategies   to  present  the  processes  behind  their  decision-making  as  if  they  are  made  within  a  sort  of  neutral  vacuum   (Wedel,  Shore,  Feldman  &  Lathrop,  2005).  This  apparent  neutrality  may  either  be  a  response  to  external   political  pressures  (neutrality  would  not  be  chosen  in  other  circumstances)  or  a  political  response  in  itself   (intentional  apparent  neutrality  with  a  hidden  political  agenda)  or  a  genuine  way  of  proceeding  politically   (no  hidden  political  agenda)  (`t  Hart,  2010).

by  resistance  that  extends  from  beyond  the  state  (with  its  own  ideologies)  that   "transform  it,  to  determine  its  policies,  or  simply  to  influence  it  at  a  distance"  (Jessop,   2012,  p.8).      According  to  Gramsci  (1971),  the  state  is  "the  entire  complex  of  practical  and  

theoretical  activities  with  which  the  ruling  class  not  only  justifies  and  maintains  its   dominance  but  manages  to  win  the  active  consent  of  those  over  whom  it  rules"   (Gramsci,  1971,  p.244  as  cited  in  Jessop,  2012,  p.8).  Jessop  distinguishes  between   power  in  a  capital  state  and  in  a  state  in  a  capitalist  society.  In  the  former,  power  is   manipulated  in  a  somber  way;  there  is  no  clear  demarcation  of  its  origins.  In  the  latter,   "power  is  contingent  and  mediated  via  relations"  (Jessop,  2014,  27:38).  In  either  case,   the  state  is  not  the  owner  of  power  but  a  means  to  mediate  different  types  of  power,   which  it  does  with  different  kinds  of  biases,  including  racial,  ethnic  and  class  biases.  The   Canadian  state  has  made  use  of  its  political  position  of  privilege  at  the  international  level   to  use  geographic  place  of  birth  (which  is  linked  to  race  and  ethnic  origin)  as  a  means   for  easy  access  to  exploitable  labour  (Strauss  &  McGrath,  2016).  Strategic-relationalist   theorists  see  the  state's  power  as  the  outcome  of  the  meeting  of  class  forces  (Jessop,   2012).   Expanding  Gramsci's  developments  on  power  and  the  state  (focused  on  state's   power  rather  than  on  its  mediatory  role),  Jessop  reinterprets  the  state  as  "government  +   governance  in  the  shadow  of  hierarchy"  (Jessop,  2014,  36:00).  Jessop's  reinterpretation   of  the  state  begins  to  pave  the  way  to  understand  the  state  as  a  mediator  of  powers  and   itself  with  a  top  down  power  used  to  bring  a  people  to  conformity,  into  the  shadow  of   ideological  influences.  In  Jessop's  (2014)  own  words,    

58  

     

Government  is  more  than  the  state  considered  as  territory,  apparatus,  population   -  it  exercises  power  in  ways  that  go  well  beyond  imperative  coordination   (Gramsci's  point  about  political  society  +  civil  society).  [And]  government  as  a   social  relation  (hegemony  armoured  by  coercion  or  statecraft),  involves  practices   that  go  well  beyond  the  state,  is  an  attempt  to  juggle,  to  rearticulate,  to   recombine,  in  different  contexts,  the  different  purposes,  at  different  times,   governmental  power  and  imperative  coordination  as  law  with  other  ways  of   influencing,  shaping,  directing,  normalizing  society  to  bring  it  into  conformity,  as   Gramsci's  would  say,  with  the  requirements  of  the  dominant  mode  of  production.   (36:12)      This  coincides  with  Michel  Foucault's  interpretation  of  the  state  as  the  "key  site  for   `strategic  codification  of  power  relations'"  (Jessop,  2014,  38:08),  which  serves  as  the   introduction  of  the  state  as  a  social  relation  by  Poulantzas.  According  to  Jessop,  "The   state,  as  official  `résumé'  of  society,  has  a  key  role  in  political  domination...all  this  occurs   through  selective  impact  of  state  form  on  shaping  political  opportunities  and  alliances   and  through  specific  state  strategies,  projects  and  policies"  (Jessop,  2014,  40:24).  As   the  place  of  confluence  of  relations,  it  is  also  a  place  of  confluence  of  powers,  so  it  is   not  uniform.      Chapter  Summary     The  first  section  of  this  chapter  provides  an  overview  of  the  different  aspects   found  in  the  literature  about  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  labour  in  Canada  that  relate  to   this  dissertation.  This  literature  review  identifies  an  area  that  is  not  addressed  in  the   existing  literature,  namely  systematic  studies  that  examine  wage  differences  at  the  level   of  occupation,  and  helps  situate  the  hypotheses  that  this  dissertation  addresses.  The   second  section  introduces  the  broader  theoretical  lenses  guiding  this  dissertation,   namely  Rational  Choice  Theory  and  Critical  Social  Theory.  The  former  is  chosen   because  it  provides  the  theoretical  tenets  supporting  the  sort  of  quantitative  analysis   59  
     

used  in  this  dissertation  (cross  tabulation  and  multivariate  regression  analysis).  The   latter  is  used  because  it  provides  a  way  to  critique  the  status  quo  for  low-skilled  TFWs   and  to  consider  new  ways  for  the  state  to  deal  with  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  labour.   The  third  section  focuses  on  three  migration  theories  (one  based  on  RCT  and  two  on   CST).  These  theories  help  interpret  the  reasons  behind  decision-making  processes  of   each  of  the  stakeholders  involved  in  the  process  of  migration  and  wage  determination.   Stakeholders  include  workers,  employers  and  the  government.  The  fourth  section   presents  the  theoretical  foundations  of  neoliberalism,  which  is  one  of  the  global  forces   that  shapes  labour  migration  and  therefore  influences  the  wages  of  low-skilled  NPRs.   The  fifth  section  provides  a  review  of  the  literature  on  foreign  low-skilled  labour  in   Canada  in  relation  to  citizenship,  which  is  the  main  distinguishing  factor  between  the   groups  whose  wages  will  be  compared.  This  section  also  addresses  theoretical  views   on  citizenship  that  help  interpret  non-citizenship  as  a  means  to  access  cheap  low-skilled   temporary  foreign  labour.  It  also  presents  theoretical  proposals  to  provide  new  ways  of   inclusion  (via  citizenship)  for  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  workers.  No  specific  studies   that  explain,  from  a  quantitative  perspective,  the  effect  of  a  lack  of  citizenship  on  wages   of  low-skilled  workers  in  Canada  were  found.  The  sixth  section  introduces  the  relation   between  citizenship  and  the  nation  state.  The  seventh  section  focuses  on  the  theoretical   approaches  of  the  state  that  help  interpret  how  the  state  constructs  the  need  for   temporary  foreign  labour  via  citizenship.     Together,  these  theoretical  tools  inform  the  following  hypothesis:  "The  policy- created  lack  of  citizenship  significantly  accounts  for  the  negative  wage  differentials  for   low-skilled  NPRs  (compared  to  CB  and  IMM)  even  when  factors  such  as  sex,  province  

60  

     

of  residence,  rural/urban  workplace,  level  of  studies,  knowledge  of  either  official   language  or  country  of  birth  are  accounted  for."  The  following  chapter  explores  the   policy  origins  of  low  wages  among  non-citizens  and  the  role  stakeholders  played  in   shaping  policy.

Chapter  Three:  Low-Skilled  Temporary  Foreign  Worker  Policies  and  Programs      This  chapter  focuses  on  the  main  policies  related  to  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  

workers  in  Canada  that  led  them  to  be  particularly  disadvantaged  in  already  low  wage   occupations.  It  explores  the  ways  in  which  immigration  policy  has  influenced  wage   disparity  across  occupational  categories  and  the  role  of  stakeholders  in  forging  such   policies.  A  revision  of  the  evolution  of  TFW  policy  is  relevant  because  it  shows  the   incidence  of  policy  on  the  low  wages  of  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  workers.  One  of   the  contributions  of  this  dissertation  is  to  think  of  how  capitalist  labour  markets  need  a   super  exploitable  workforce.  In  the  Canadian  context,  there  are  at  least  two  ways:  via   the  low-skilled  in  general;  and  by  attaching  some  low-skilled  (foreign-born)  to   temporality  and  non-citizenship.  Some  in  those  low-skilled  jobs  are  paying  a  high  price   by  earning  very  low  wages  derived  from  their  lack  of  citizenship.      Temporary  foreign  labour  policy  has  divided  low-skilled  populations  into  three  

main  groups:  caregiving,  agriculture  and  workers  in  all  other  low-skilled  occupations.   Caregivers  were  the  first  to  work  as  noncitizens  in  the  Canadian  labour  force,  followed   by  agricultural  workers  and  then  by  workers  in  all  other  low-skilled  occupations.  From   policy  perspective,  employing  foreign  workers  in  low-skilled  occupations  is  justifiable   when  such  occupations  exhibit  genuine  labour  market  shortages  (Gross,  2014).   However,  my  analysis  will  show  that  a  significant  number  of  workers  without  citizenship   in  these  occupations  earn  significantly  less  than  Canadian-born  and  Immigrants.  Even  if   each  occupation  has  a  broad  range  of  jobs  with  an  equally  broad  range  of  wages,  it  is   nevertheless  important  to  ask:  why  a  significant  number  of  those  working  on  a  

62  

     

temporary  basis  (i.e.  without  citizenship)  earn  less  than  those  with  the  rights  associated   with  citizenship?  Are  such  differences  dictated  by  policy?        Regulations  pertaining  to  low-skilled  TFW  programs  have  provided  a  means  to  

maintain  an  indentured  labour  force  that  works  for  lower  wages.  Such  regulations  bind   workers  to  a  single  employer  and  deny  them  access  to  citizenship  or  settlement   programs  that  would  help  them  integrate  into  the  larger  society  (Hennebry,  2012;   Preibisch  and  Binford,  2007).  Even  if  workers  can  change  employers,  fear  of  being  sent   back  to  the  country  of  origin  or  not  being  called  back  the  following  season  holds  most   TFWs  captive  in  their  existing  job  conditions.  These  programs  also  allow  the  state  to   foster  competition  in  the  internal  labour  market  (Hennebry  &  Preibisch,  2012),  fostering   conditions  that  maintain  low  wages  and  help  local  economies  prosper.  As  cited  in   Hennebry  and  Preibisch  (2012),  Hahamovitch  (2003)  observes  that  as  "`efforts  to  make   immigration  temporary  or  to  `regularize'  illegal  immigration,  guest-worker  programs  have   failed.  Yet  as  labour  supply  systems  designed  to  `regularize'  wages,  to  hold  down  the   cost  of  sugar  cane  harvesting  in  Florida,  diamond  mining  in  South  Africa,  construction   work  in  Europe,  and  child  care  in  Montreal,  and  to  keep  foreign  workers  segregated  in   low-wage  industries,  these  programs  have  been  unmitigated  success  stories"  (p.21).        Low-skilled  temporary  foreign  labour  policy  in  Canada  designates  three  groups  of  

low-skilled  workers  (caregiving,  agriculture  and  other  low-skilled  occupations).  Each   group  has  very  distinct  origins  and  policy  developments.  Insofar  as  they  provide   different  pathways  for  foreign  low-skilled  labourers,  each  group  offers  a  unique   experience  of  the  Canadian  labour  market.  Though  some  experiences  are  common   among  all  groups,  it  is  nevertheless  important  to  distinguish  the  policies  operative  in  

63  

     

each  group.  As  the  analysis  shows,  occupations  in  each  of  these  groups  have  different   labour  market  outcomes.     The  following  sections  will  consider  the  TFW  policy  changes  affecting  each  of   these  occupational  groups  as  well  as  stakeholders'  role  in  policy  making.  Employers,   policymakers,  advocacy  groups  and  the  workers  themselves  have  all  played  a  role  in   shaping  policy.  While  some  stakeholders,  such  as  employers,  policymakers,  advocacy   groups  and  local  and  foreign  governments,  have  played  a  more  explicit  or  intentional   role  in  defining  program  regulations,  others,  most  notably  the  workers,  have  played  a   more  tacit  or  unintentional  role.  Though  no  less  important,  the  impact  that  workers  have   on  developing  policy  is  less  a  function  of  agency  and  more  a  function  of  individual   circumstances.  In  this  research  we  will  see,  a  NPRs'  lack  of  citizenship  has  a   predominant  role  on  their  low  wages.       Academics  from  different  disciplines  tend  to  express  very  different  views  on  low- skilled  temporary  foreign  labour.  Using  quantitative  tools,  economists  are  more  likely  to   advocate  approaches  based  on  rational  principles  that  maximize  benefits  and  minimize   costs.  In  contrast,  social  scientists,  drawing  on  qualitative  methods  and  critical   perspectives,  usually  focus  on  the  lived  experience  of  TFWs  and  the  influence  of   powerful  interests.  The  discrepancy  between  these  positions  reflects  the  fundamental   tension  between  Rational  Choice  Theory  and  Critical  Social  Theory  (discussed  in  the   previous  chapter),  a  tension  that  informs  the  analysis  of  this  dissertation.   With  all  this  in  mind,  each  of  the  following  sections  explores  the  perspectives  of  various   stakeholders  in  view  of  their  unique  role  in  the  historical  development  of  TFWs  policies.   A  historical  approach  provides  clarity  on  how  each  group  of  workers  has  been  affected  

64  

     

by  the  specific  interests  governing  stakeholders'  actions.  As  the  primary  recipients  of   these  policy  regulations,  the  role  of  the  workers  is  considered  in  more  detail  in  the   subsections  that  follow.   The  chapter  is  divided  in  four  main  sections:  In  section  one,  I  present  the   changes  associated  to  temporary  foreign  labour  in  caregiving  occupations.  In  section   two,  I  introduce  the  policy  changes  related  to  the  temporary  foreign  labour  in  agriculture.   In  section  three,  I  outline  the  main  changes  associated  to  temporary  low-skilled  foreign   labour  in  occupations  other  than  caregiving  and  agriculture.  Finally,  in  section  four,  I   introduce  the  current  pathways  to  access  low-skilled  TFWs  and  make  a  brief  overview   of  the  policy  changes  recently  introduced  by  the  federal  government  that  affect  low- skilled  TFWs  in  general.  Sections  one  and  two  cover  policies  and  experiences  affecting   low-skilled  temporary  foreign  labour  linked  exclusively  to  caregiving  and  agriculture   developed  from  the  late  1800s  up  until  2010.  The  third  section  outlines  the  changes   from  the  early  2000s  to  2013  and  that  opened  doors  to  low-skilled  TFWs  in  occupations   other  than  caregiving  and  agriculture.  The  final  section  covers  the  current  low-skilled   pathways  and  policy  changes  including  those  introduced  between  2014  and  2016.      3.1.  Live-in  Caregivers:  Main  Policy  Changes  and  Motivations      There  is  a  long  history  to  this  program;  the  discussion  here  goes  beyond  the  very  

brief  treatment  in  chapter  two.  Historically,  race  has  been  a  significant  factor  in   policymaking  for  domestic  workers  in  Canada.  The  LIC  has  historical  roots  that  trace  as   far  back  as  to  the  end  of  the  nineteenth  century,  when  British  and  Scandinavian  women   migrated  as  domestic  labourers  to  be  considered  as  potential  wives  (Cohen,  2000).  As  

65  

     

this  example  illustrates,  policies  related  to  temporary  foreign  workers  usually  target  a   specific  sex,  a  specific  country  of  origin  and,  by  extension,  a  specific  race  of  foreign   workers  to  fulfill  specific  labour  demands.  In  line  with  this  trend,  women  from  the   Philippines  have  become  the  main  source  of  live-in  caregivers  in  Canada.        By  1889  the  need  for  domestic  labour  was  acute  so  bringing  domestic  labour  

from  the  British  Isles  became  the  first  solution.  British  domestic  women  were  brought  to   Canada  in  keeping  with  policies  designed  to  consolidate  'Saxon  superiority'  and  uphold   specific  expectations  concerning  the  role  of  women  in  society  (McLaren,  1990;  Stasiulis   &  Williams,  1992,  as  cited  in  Bakan  &  Stasiulis,  1994).  Unmet  demand  of  domestics   (linked  to  declining  relevance  of  domestic  work  among  woman)  made  the  government  to   persuade  Finish  domestics  to  move  to  Canada  in  the  early  1900s  (Lindström,  2010).   British  domestics  still  represented  the  largest  proportion  ("75%  before  World  War  One   and  60%  during  the  1920s")  (Lindström,  2010,  p.  36).  During  the  1920s  Finish   domestics  made  8%  of  all  female  immigrant  domestics  (Lindström,  2010,  p.  36).  Most  of   them  were  mature  women  with  domestic  work  experience  back  in  Finland.  By  the  late   1920s  and  early  1930s,  during  the  depression  years,  only  women  would  find  work,  to   the  point  that  women  were  the  breadwinners.    Even,  by  1937  "when  all  doors  to   immigration  were  shut,  the  government  launched  a  special  scheme  to  bring  in   `Scandinavian  and  Finish  domestics'"  (Lindström,  2010,  p.38).  After  World  War  II,   prosperity  in  rural  areas  and  a  consolidation  of  the  middle  class  in  urban  Canada  led   again  to  an  increase  in  requests  for  foreign  domestic  workers  (Cohen,  2000).  Since   domestic  labour  was  scarce  in  the  1950s,  the  Canadian  government  opened  its  doors  to   other  women,  at  first  from  Germany,  and  then  from  Italy  and  later  from  Greece.    

66  

     

Between  1911  and  1914,  a  small  group  of  black  women  from  Guadeloupe  was  brought   to  Canada  to  work  as  domestics.  However,  afterwards,  black  women  were  not  brought   to  Canada  because  of  their  "assumed  inability  to  adapt  to  the  Canadian  climate,  and   their  assumed  sexual  licentiousness"  (MacKenzie,  1988;  Timoll,  1989,  38-9,  as  cited  in   Bakan  &  Stasiulis,  1994,  p.12).   Up  until  the  1950s,  foreign-born  women  of  colour  were  rarely  offered  work  as   domestics  in  Canada  (Cohen,  2000).  In  1955,  Canada  admitted  a  few  Caribbean   women  (mainly  from  Jamaica  and  Barbados)  to  work  in  domestic  labour  (Cohen  2000,   Faraday,  2012).  .  Although  residence  was  granted  upon  arrival,  a  policy  was  developed   that  restricted  their  ability  to  stay  to  their  employers'  satisfaction.  They  were  also   subjected  to  sexually  transmitted  diseases  tests  proving  this  the  government   assumptions  on  their  assumed  licentiousness  (Bakan  &  Stasiulis,  1994).  An  official   agreement  between  Canada  and  the  Caribbean  nations  stipulated  that,  if  they  were   deemed  unsuitable  for  the  work,  women  could  be  sent  back  to  their  countries  of  origin   (Bakan  &  Stasiulis,  1994).  By  the  late  1950s  less  than  one  fourth  of  all  Caribbean   domestic  women  were  staying  more  than  three  years  working  as  domestics  (Macklin,   1992).  This  labour  mobility  and  the  intent  among  some  to  bring  their  relatives  were   concerning  factors  to  the  Canadian  government  (Macklin,  1992).  Even  though  the   literature  documents  labour  mobility,  by  the  1960s,  Caribbean  women  had  been  left  out   of  many  labour  regulations,  negatively  reinforcing  their  marginal  and  precarious  status   in  low-wage  jobs.  They  were  excluded  from  legislation  that  guaranteed  a  minimum   wage  and  that  regulated  hours  of  labour;  and  in  most  Canadian  provinces,  except   Prince  Edward  Island  and  Saskatchewan,  annual  vacation  legislation  did  not  apply  to  

67  

     

them  (Daenzer,  1991).  Only  in  Manitoba  were  these  women  included  in  public  holidays   laws  (Daenzer,  1991).  Job  discrimination  in  the  Montreal  area  was  also  documented   (Henry,  1968).  This  experience  contrasted  significantly  with  that  of  domestic  workers  of   European  origin,  who  did  not  face  the  same  barriers,  as  reported  by  Cohen  (2000).  As  if   these  barriers  were  not  enough,  as  of  1973,  Caribbean  women  were  no  longer  granted   residence  upon  arrival.  The  temporary  nature  of  foreign  domestic  work  was  formally  and   strategically  introduced  through  policy  with  the  Temporary  Employment  Authorization   Program.  Government  officials  introduced  this  program  because,  even  though   Caribbean  domestic  workers  were  not  supposed  to  have  a  family,  some  began  to   sponsor  family  members  (Brickner  &  Straehle,  2010).  This  program  allowed  them  entry   with  temporary  work  permits  that  could  be  renewed  annually  for  a  period  of  up  to  three   years  (Bakan  &  Stasiulis,  2002).     After  years  of  pressure  from  advocacy  groups,  in  1981  the  federal  government   introduced  the  Foreign  Domestic  Movement  Program  (FDM)  (Cohen,  2000).  This  was  a   formal  response  to  complaints  regarding  the  violation  of  domestic  workers'  human   rights.  LIC's  pathway  to  citizenship  was  the  outcome  of  pressures  from  human  rights   activist  groups,  academics,  bureaucratic  analysts  and  domestic  organizations  all   denouncing  abuses  related  to  domestics'  living  and  labour  conditions  (Cohen,  2000;   Daenzer,  1997).  This  program  allowed  them  to  apply  for  permanent  residence  after  two   years  of  work  (Stratemeyer-Trinczek,  2012).  Of  all  requirements  included  in  this   program,  the  mandatory  condition  that  domestic  workers  live  with  their  employer   contributed  most  to  the  vulnerability  and  abuse  experienced  by  women  participating  in   this  program.  While  most  foreign  domestics  in  the  past  had  also  lived  with  their  

68  

     

employers,  previous  versions  of  the  program  did  not  stipulate  that  this  condition  was   mandatory  (Daenzer,  1991).  The  argument  for  making  it  mandatory  was  that  live-out   domestics  were  available  for  the  local  labour  market  (Bakan  &  Stasiulis,  1994).   Whatever  the  economic  reason,  it  is  clear  that  this  mandate  led  to  an  increased  sense   of  isolation  and  fear  of  deportation  among  workers  (Hodge,  2006)  and  lower  wages   (Faraday,  2012).  It  points  to  the  folly  of  developing  policies  based  on  labour  market   principles  without  duly  considering  their  impact  on  the  most  vulnerable  members  of   society.     In  addition  to  its  domestic  policies,  global  neoliberalism  and  foreign  policies  also   contributed  to  Canada's  use  of  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  labour.  This  is  especially   apparent  in  the  case  of  employing  workers  from  the  Philippines  or  the  Caribbean.  The   influx  of  Filipino  caregivers  in  Canada  started  to  become  significant  in  the  1980s.  In   1983,  about  3  500  people  entered  Canada  through  the  FDM.  By  1990,  this  number  had   increased  to  approximately  10  700  (Mikita,  1994).  In  1983,  29%  of  domestic  workers  in   Canada  were  European  (of  which  almost  19%  were  British);  and  Filipino  and  Caribbean   workers  made  up  approximately  15%.  In  1990,  Filipino  applicants  made  up  more  than   60%  (approximately  6  500  entries)  of  all  FDM  entries  and  Europeans  made  up  only  14%   (Mikita,  1994).     This  sudden  increase  in  Filipino  migration  can  be  understood  as  a  response  to   economic  pressures  in  the  Philippines  backed  up  by  emigration  policies  introduced  by   the  Filipino  government.  More  specifically,  "the  declaration  of  Martial  Law  by  President   Marcos  in  1972  combined  with...the  promotion  of  overseas  labor  export  as  an  economic   development  strategy  to  relieve  nationwide  unemployment,  fueled  the  huge  outflow  of  

69  

     

migrant  workers  in  this  era"  (Garchitorena  2007;  Kelly  2006;  Lan  2000  as  cited  in   Ronquillo  et  al.,  2011  p.267).  While  Caribbean  migration  is  the  outcome  of  imperial  ties,   Filipino  migration  reveals  "aggressive  marketing  of  labour  for  export  on  the  part  of   various  Philippine  governments  (from  Marcos  to  Aquino  to  Ramos)"  (Bakan  &  Stasiulis,   1997,  p.125).      In  1992,  the  domestic  program  evolved  into  the  Live-in  Caregiver  Program,  which  

introduced  a  more  formal  assessment  of  caregiver's  credentials  (education  equivalent  to   grade  12  and  six-month  training  in  a  field  similar  to  the  job  applied).  Instead  of  being   called  domestics,  workers  in  this  occupation  were  referred  to  as  caregivers.  Access  to   permanent  residence  (and  further  citizenship)  was  dependent  not  only  on  two  years  in   caregiving  work,  but  also  on  proof  of  social  adaptability,  occupational  upgrading  and   financial  security  (Bakan  &  Stasiulis,  1994).  While  the  last  requirement  represents  the   most  vivid  disconnect  between  the  regulation  and  the  lived  reality  of  these  workers  (i.e.   low  wages),  all  these  requirements  were  considered  unfair  since  they  did  not  apply  to   workers  in  other  occupations  with  a  high  demand  for  labour  (Arat  Koc,  1991,  as  cited  in   Bakan  &  Stasiulis,  1994).     To  mitigate  these  imbalances,  in  the  spring  of  2010,  both  the  federal  government   and  the  government  of  Ontario  passed  laws  to  protect  live-in  caregivers  (Ontario   Ministry  of  Labour,  2010).  Ontario  enacted  the  Employment  Protection  for  Foreign   Nationals  Act  (Live-in  Caregivers  and  others),  which,  as  the  name  suggests,  focuses  on   protection  of  temporary  foreign  workers  coming  under  the  Live-in  Caregiver  Program.   The  act  was  designed  to  regulate  recruitment  practices  by  "banning  recruitment  fees,   prohibiting  reprisals  against  live-in  caregivers  for  exercising  their  rights  under  the  

70  

     

legislation,  and  prohibiting  an  employer  or  recruiter  (the  legislation  uniquely  covers   recruiters)  in  Ontario  from  taking  possession  of  a  live-in  caregiver's  property,  including   documents  such  as  passports"  (Gellatly  et  al.,  2011,  p.89).     The  act  also  gives  them  up  to  3.5  years  to  make  claims  on  unlawful  fees  that   may  have  been  paid,  given  the  precariousness  of  their  citizenship  situation  before   applying  for  permanent  residence  (Gellatly  et  al.,  2011).  However  well-intended,  the  act   fell  short  in  three  specific  aspects:  1)  its  jurisprudence  is  limited  to  Ontario  and  most   workers  have  arrangements  with  recruiters  outside  of  Canada,  which  makes   enforcement  difficult;  2)  the  legislation  targets  a  small  group  of  workers  (LICs),   excluding  other  workers  in  precarious  and  unprotected  working  conditions  (Gellatly  et   al.,  2011);  and  3)  even  if  caregivers  are  granted  an  avenue  to  issue  complaints,  this   does  not  resolve  the  power  dynamics,  which  are  driven  by  fear  of  reprisal,  that  prevent   workers  from  speaking  out30  (Faraday,  2012).        3.2.  Agricultural  Labour:  Main  policy  Changes  and  Motivations        Since  the  decrease  in  the  number  of  LICs  coming  to  Canada,  agriculture  

represents  the  largest  employer  of  TFWs.  The  Conference  Board  of  Canada  reports  that   agriculture  represented  58%  of  all  LMIAs31  approved  in  2015  (Conference  Board  of   Canada,  2016).  The  general  labour  and  living  conditions  of  agricultural  workers  in   Canada  have  been  defined  by  three  different  geographic  and  historical  origins:  The   Caribbean,  Mexico,  and  other  countries  (mainly  in  Central  America,  the  Philippines  and

  In  2015,  Ontario  also  introduced  the  Immigration  Act,  which  includes  clauses  addressing  some  of  the   issues  related  to  recruitment.   31   LMIA=  Labour  Market  Impact  Assessment,  a  document  that  evaluates  whether  a  TFW  affects  the   Canadian  labour  market.

Southeast  Asia).  This  section  will  focus  on  Caribbean  and  Mexican  influences.  The  third   group  of  agricultural  workers  will  be  explored  alongside  workers  from  other  occupations   later  in  this  chapter.   The  first  two  groups  have  historically  come  to  Canada  through  the  Seasonal   Agricultural  Worker  Program  (SAWP).  In  the  past,  the  last  group  came  primarily  through   the  program  previously  known  as  the  Low-Skilled  Pilot  Program,  which  was  later   transformed  into  the  low-skilled  stream.  Currently  this  group  comes  through  the   Agricultural  stream  and  the  low-wage  stream32.  Through  these  alternative  agricultural   streams,  employers  can  hire  workers  from  anywhere  other  than  Mexico  and  the   Caribbean.  Thus,  workers  from  outside  of  Mexico  or  the  Caribbean  have  a  relatively   recent  history  of  participation  in  Canadian  agriculture.           3.2.1.  Caribbean  agricultural  labor.  The  presence  of  Caribbean  workers  in  

Canada  stems  from  the  historic  relationship  that  already  existed  between  Britain  and  the   Caribbean.  The  Caribbean's  primary  means  of  production  were  primarily  owned  by   British  citizens  who  took  most  of  the  profits  back  to  Britain,  creating  a  relation  of   dependency  on  Britain.  In  the  Caribbean,  "Monoculture  during  slavery  has  been   replaced  by  monopoly  and  foreign  ownership"  (Andre,  1990,  p.253).  This  tradition  of   dependence  and  foreign  ownership  persists  to  the  present  day  and,  as  an  heir  of   Britain's  colonial  past,  Canada  continues  to  have  strong  economic  ties  to  the  Caribbean.   Canadian  banks,  for  example,  have  dominated  the  banking  sector  in  the  Caribbean   since  the  early  1900s  (Andre,  1990).  This  permanent  dominance  by  foreign  corporations

over  the  Caribbean's  means  of  production  has  led  to  a  continuous  export  of  revenue   and  high  levels  of  unemployment  in  the  Caribbean  nations  (Andre,  1990).   Scarcity  of  labour  in  Canada  was  also  a  significant  driver  of  temporary  foreign  labour.   The  number  of  agricultural  workers  in  Ontario  dropped  from  about  850  000  in  1953  to   about  470  000  in  1974  (Andre,  1990).  Alongside  this  increased  demand  for  foreign   labour,  high  unemployment  rates  in  the  Caribbean  led  Caribbean  governments  to   introduce  policies  to  encourage  emigration  (permanent  or  temporary)  to  richer  countries,   including  Canada.  For  example,  in  1873  the  government  of  Barbados  approved  a  law  to   help  poor  and  unemployed  Barbadians  emigrate  (Andre,  1990).  Caribbean  countries   saw  the  possibility  of  working  in  Canada  (among  other  nations)  as  a  means  to  economic   development  (Andre,  1990),  perhaps  via  remittances  and  the  future  transmission  of   knowledge.   While  the  federal  government  tried  to  implement  programs  to  attract  Canadian- born  workers  and  immigrants  to  the  agricultural  sector,  the  turnouts  were  not  enough  to   meet  labour  needs.  The  government  also  tried  to  mobilize  indigenous  people,  prisoners,   people  in  psychiatric  hospitals  and  unemployed  French  Canadians  to  work  in  Southern   Ontario  farms.  However,  Ontario  farmers  found  them  to  be  unsatisfactory  labourers   (Satzewich,  2008).  As  a  result,  the  Commonwealth  Caribbean  Seasonal  Agricultural   Workers  Program  (CSAWP)  was  introduced  to  fulfill  labour  demands  (Andre,  1990).   This  was  the  first  country-to-country  agreement  to  fulfill  labour  needs  with  temporary   foreign  labour.  However,  in  time  this  would  show  to  be  a  way  to  segment  agricultural   labour  in  the  lines  of  race  (via  ethnic  origin).  

73  

     

  

As  with  the  LIC  program,  race  has  been  a  significant  factor  in  the  development  of  

Canadian  TFW  agricultural  policy.  In  the  years  following  the  second  world  war,  scarcity   of  agricultural  labour  in  southern  Ontario  led  the  government  to  bring  in  some  of  the  less   desired  workers  from  Eastern  Europe  willing  to  move  to  Canada.  The  following  is  an   excerpt  extracted  from  Satzewich's33  research  (1991,  2008),  which  quotes  the  Deputy   Minister  of  Citizenship  and  Immigration  in  the  1960s.  It  illustrates  how  Canada's   policymakers  established  a  distinction  between  two  types  of  immigration  that  is  still   operative  today:  immigration  by  necessity  (not  so  desirable)  and  immigration  by  choice   (desirable):  "The  Polish  veterans  and  refugees  [Displaced  Persons]  were  in  a  position   where  they  had  little  alternative  but  to  emigrate  from  their  European  countries  of   residence.  At  present,  however,  most  immigrants  are  employed  in  their  own  country  and   come  to  Canada  not  through  necessity  but  as  a  matter  of  choice.  It  is  necessary  to  sell   them  on  the  idea  of  coming  to  Canada"  (Satzewich,  1991,  p.120,  as  cited  in  Satzewich,   2008,  p.264).  In  contrast  with  the  treatment  of  veterans  and  refugees,  Dutch   immigrants,  who  came  to  Canada  by  choice,  were  considered  too  valuable  to  place   them  in  conditions  of  'unfreedom'  (Satzewich,  2008).      Canada  also  has  a  history  of  discriminating  against  black  workers.  However,  in  

the  1960s  the  government  finally  responded  to  pressure  from  employers  and  agreed  to   give  up  its  position  on  the  inability  of  black  people  to  integrate  (Kelley  &  Trebilcock,   1999).  In  response  to  an  obvious  scarcity  of  labour  and  the  criticism  of  advocacy  groups   and  academics  about  the  racial  characteristics  of  Canadian  immigration  policies,  black

  Satzewich  (2008)  presents  the  evolution  of  Canadian  temporary  foreign  labour  policies  in  agriculture  by   reviewing  internal  communications  from  the  Department  of  Manpower,  old  Immigration,  Refugee  and   Citizenship  Canada  (IRCC).

people  were  officially  allowed  to  work  in  Canada  (Satzewich,  2008).  This  opened  the   doors  of  Canadian  temporary  agricultural  work  to  Caribbean  employees.  The  first  labour   agreement  was  with  Jamaica  and  in  1966  the  first  264  Jamaican  agricultural  workers   came  to  Canada  (Andre,  1990).  Numbers  grew  to  about  3  000  by  1973  and  in  1976   other  Caribbean  nations  signed  similar  agreements  with  Canada  (Andre,  1990).  In  this   way,  the  incorporation  of  Caribbean  temporary  labour  responded  to  economic  and  racial   rationales  designed  to  benefit  Canada  (Satzewich,  2008).  The  presence  of  Caribbean   workers  on  a  temporary  basis  was  not  only  the  result  of  pressure  from  employers,  but   also  the  outcome  of  pressure  from  other  fronts  and  policymaker's  decision-making   processes  and  negotiations:     By  admitting  workers  from  the  Caribbean  on  a  seasonal  basis  to  come  to   Canada,  Canadian  immigration  officials  could  offer  this  as  further  proof  that   immigration  policy  was  not  tinged  by  racial  considerations.  Employer  interests   were  not  the  sole  determining  factors  in  shaping  policy  decisions.  If  employer   interests  and  their  associated  lobbying  were  all-powerful,  then  employers  would   have  had  access  to  migrant  labour  well  before  1966.  Immigration  officials  did   play  a  determining  role  insofar  as  they  were  the  gatekeepers  and  were   unconvinced  that  employers'  preferred  solution  to  labour  force  recruitment  and   retention  problems  ­  migrant  labour  from  the  Caribbean  ­  would  be  in  the  best   long-term  economic  and  social  interests  of  the  country  (Satzewich,  2008,  p.265).      Thus,  low  wages  among  Caribbean  workers  in  agriculture  is  the  continuation  of  a   historically  exploitative  relationship  between  Britain  and  the  Caribbean  that  goes  back  to   colonial  times.  It  was  the  continuation  of  a  pre-existing  kind  of  labour  force  that  would,   out  of  necessity,  eventually  respond  to  the  labour  needs  of  Canada.      Canada's  exploitative  use  of  foreign  workers,  however,  is  certainly  not  limited  to  

Caribbean  workers.  Workers  from  other  nationalities  have  come  to  replace  the  role  of   Caribbean  workers  in  the  Canadian  economy.  As  will  be  further  explored,  race-related  

75  

     

stereotypes  surrounding  Caribbean  people's  culture  and  behaviour  have  led  to  their   replacement  with  Mexican  labour  (Preibisch  &  Binford,  2007).         3.2.2.  Mexican  agricultural  labour.  Temporary  low-skilled  Mexican  labour  in  the  

Canadian  agricultural  sector  coming  through  a  government-run  TFW  program  has  its   origins  in  1974  when  the  first  208  agricultural  workers  from  Mexico  joined  the  5  500  plus   Caribbean  workers  working  on  Canadian  farms  (Preibisch  &  Binford,  2007).  Over  the   next  10  years,  their  number  gradually  increased,  reaching  approximately  1  000  workers   in  1984  (Weston  &  Scarpa  Marsellis,  2003).  Between  1985  and  1990,  the  number   started  to  increase  even  more  rapidly  and  in  the  early  1990s  it  exceeded  the  number  of   Caribbean  workers  (Weston  &  Scarpa  Marsellis,  2003).  By  2001,  Mexican  labour   accounted  for  51%  of  all  seasonal  agricultural  workers  coming  through  the  SAWP   (Preibisch  &  Binford,  2007).  But  the  increase  in  Mexican  labour  was  not  entirely  due  to   the  growth  of  production  that  took  place  during  the  1990s.   The  replacement  of  Caribbean  workers  with  Mexican  labour  is  relevant  to  this   analysis  because  it  demonstrates  how  pressure  from  different  stakeholders  has  the   power  to  inform  policy.  Documents  from  the  Department  of  Manpower  and  Immigration   (DMI)  and  the  Department  of  External  Affairs  identified  two  main  issues  that  defined   seasonal  agricultural  labour  in  the  early  1970s.  On  the  one  hand,  although  farmers  had   access  to  Caribbean  labour  through  the  CSAWP,  the  labour  provided  via  this  program   was  becoming  economically  inefficient.  As  a  way  to  control  the  number  of  Caribbean   workers  coming  to  Canada,  during  the  first  years  of  agreements  Caribbean  countries  

76  

     

had  the  power  to  annually  negotiate  the  workers'  wages.  Not  surprisingly,  annual  wage   increases  made  these  workers  less  attractive  to  farmers  in  Ontario:     As  a  result,  the  wage  rates  specified  in  the  contracts  for  Caribbean  seasonal   workers  tended  to  increase  from  year  to  year.  According  to  documentation   provided  to  government  officials  by  the  Ontario  Fruit  and  Vegetable  Growers   Association,  the  wage  rate  for  workers  from  the  Caribbean  had  increased  32%   from  $1.25  per  hour  in  1966  to  $1.65  per  hour  in  1970.  At  the  same  time,  the   Association  noted  that  the  price  of  apples  (one  of  the  main  crops  harvested  by   seasonal  workers)  increased  by  only  8%  during  the  same  period  (Satzewich,   2008,  p.266).      On  the  other  hand,  investigations  in  the  early  1970s  reported  Ontario  farmers  employing   seasonal  workers  from  Mexico  and  Portugal,  many  of  whom  were  undocumented  and   received  low  wages.  DMI  reports  state  that  Mexican  workers  and  their  families  were   Mennonites  from  the  Mexican  provinces  of  Chihuahua  and  Durango  and  many  were   driven  to  their  destinations  in  buses  from  the  US-Mexican  border.  The  report  describes   the  deplorable  accommodations  and  general  labour  conditions  endured  by  these   Mexicans  and  their  families.  Some  of  them,  for  example,  were  lodged  in  abandoned   shacks  and  barns.  Wages  were  paid  to  the  father  and  perhaps  to  the  mother  and   children  over  18  (Satzewich,  2008).     Farmers'  complaints  about  the  economic  unviability  of  bringing  in  Caribbean   workers  and  the  growing  use  of  undocumented  hyper-exploited  Mexican  labour   prompted  government  leaders  to  officially  include  Mexico  in  the  agricultural  temporary   foreign  worker  program  (Satzewich,  2008).  Including  Mexico  served  several  purposes:  it   curtailed  the  bargaining  power  of  Caribbean  nations  when  negotiating  wages  for   Caribbean  workers;  it  regularized  the  use  of  a  significantly  exploited  labour  force;  and  it  

77  

     

helped  the  DMI  recover  control  over  certain  aspects  of  immigration  that  had  been   somewhat  out  of  control  (Satzewich,  2008).   As  previously  discussed,  in  contrast  with  English-speaking  Caribbean  workers,   Mexicans'  lack  of  English  proficiency  resulted  in  a  labour  force  facing  more  challenges   to  complain34  than  those  who  spoke  English.  In  agricultural  occupations,  a  lack  of  skills   in  English  or  French  proved  to  be  detrimental  to  workers'  health  (Henebry,  McLaughlin  &   Preibisch,  2015)  and  to  limit  workers'  access  to  their  rights  (Basok,  2004),  prompting   some  authors  to  make  a  case  for  certified  interpreters  (Mysyk  et  al.,  2009).  A  lack  of   language  skills  also  restricts  access  to  social  spaces  of  inclusion,  human  relations,   identities,  services,  as  well  as  responsibilities  (De  Luna-Villalón,  2011).  Despite  their   lack  of  English  or  French  proficiency,  they  are  desirable  because  of  their  willingness  to   work  under  less  desirable  conditions.  Though  motivated,  in  part,  by  a  genuine  desire  to   do  their  best,  Mexicans'  willingness  to  work  is  also  related  to  a  lack  of  language  skills   and  knowledge  of  their  rights  and  the  fear  of  being  sent  back  home  to  the  desperate   labour  conditions  back  in  Mexico  (Preibisch  &  Binford,  2007).  Thus,  some  employers   use  a  workers'  lack  of  official  language  skills  to  segment  the  labour  market  (Binford,   2008).  In  contrast,  the  required  capacity  for  live-in  caregivers  to  speak  either  English  or   French  enables  them  to  know  their  rights  and  to  voice  their  experiences.  Nevertheless,   it  is  important  to  note  that  speaking  an  official  Canadian  language  does  not  guarantee  a   positive  labour  experience;  Caribbean  workers  who  speak  English,  for  example,

  In  a  similar  vein,  reports  reveal  that,  among  Caribbean  workers,  farmers  preferred  Jamaicans  because   they  were  known  to  complain  less  than  other  Caribbean  workers.  Trinidadians  and  Tobagonians,  for   example,  had  a  reputation  for  demanding  better  accommodation  and  labour  conditions  (Satzewich,  2008),   which  made  them  less  desirable.             

78  

     

nevertheless  experience  discrimination  linked  to  their  accent,  let  alone  race  (Henebry,   McLaughlin  &  Preibisch,  2015)   As  with  LICs,  foreign  policies  once  again  favoured  Canada's  use  of  low-skilled   foreign  labour.  Neoliberal  policies  in  Mexico,  including  privatization  and  agreements   such  as  NAFTA,  led  to  reductions  in  the  government's  capacity  to  help  Mexican  farmers   (peasants)  (Binford,  2009).  The  Mexican  economy  has  been  flooded  with  American   products.  Even  agricultural  products  that  were  staple  items  of  the  Mexican  diet  ended   up  being  cheaper  to  purchase  abroad  (from  producers  who  received  large  subsidies)   than  to  produce  them  locally  (Binford,  2009).     In  view  of  the  racialized  and  gendered  nature  of  selecting  temporary  foreign   workers,  research  also  explores  how  the  host  society  plays  a  role  in  constructing   stereotypes  of  foreign  workers  ­  often  ethnically-related  ­  that  reinforce  discourses  of   separation  between  locals  and  workers  and  provide  tools  to  perpetuate  exploitation   (Bauder,  2008a).  From  this  perspective,  conditioning  at  birth  and  at  work  (interior- exterior  conditioning)  work  together  to  construct  the  essential  aspects  of  a  "productive   workforce  that  can  be  profitably  deployed"  (Binford,  2009,  p.505).  Indeed,  it  is  only  with   the  right  conditioning  that  a  dual  wage  framework,  for  example,  which  differentiates   Mexican  (lower)  wages  from  Canadian  wages,  can  be  portrayed  as  a  great  opportunity   for  poor  Mexican  workers  (Binford,  2009)  rather  than  as  a  form  of  systematic   exploitation.  Underlying  these  instances  of  systemic  racism  is  the  global  ethnic   hierarchy,  a  consequence  of  our  colonial  past,  which  privileges  white  people  of   European  origin  and  marginalizes  people  from  non-white  ethnic  origins  (Gradstein  &   Schiff,  2004).

Through  temporary  foreign  worker  programs,  farmers  have  access  to  a  labour   force  that  competes  transnationally  with  the  local  labour  force  and  that  is  willing  to  work   for  significantly  lower  wages.  But  it  is  important  to  remember  that  the  apparent   eagerness  exhibited  by  many  low-skilled  workers  is  usually  generated  by  a  desperate   situation  in  their  countries  of  birth  (Basok,  2002;  Binford,  2006).  Indeed,  the  program   specifically  targets  peasants  who  live  in  desperate  conditions  and  can  only  find  rural   jobs  that  have  very  low  wages.  In  2001,  they  were  paid  at  about  40  to  60  Mexican   pesos  a  day,  which  was  between  6  and  10  Canadian  dollars  a  day  (Binford,  2002).  In   2006,  the  exchange  rate  was  about  9.6  pesos  per  dollar  (Canadian  Forex,  2015).  As   such,  Mexican  wages  between  40  to  60  pesos  were  equivalent  to  between  3.3  and  6.4   Canadian  dollars  a  day.  In  contrast,  Canadian  wages  in  the  same  year  (the  year  of  the   census)  were  about  $7.45/hour,  (the  2006  minimum  wage  in  Ontario),  at  least  10  times   higher  than  what  they  would  earn  in  Mexico.  The  Canadian  program  is  attractive  to   them  not  only  because  it  has  better  wages  but  also  because  it  is  safer  than  illegally   crossing  the  border  to  the  United  States  and  is  cheaper  (in  2001,  approximately  120   dollars)  than  the  high  cost  of  legally  doing  so  (Binford,  2002).  However,  even  if  these   wages  allow  them  to  educate  their  children  and  to  improve  their  general  living   standards,  the  price  for  doing  so  is  high:  family  separation,  long  (sometimes  unpaid)   hours  of  employment  and,  in  some  cases,  abuse  and  exploitation.  The  wage   discrepancy  between  Mexican  and  Canadian  workers  is  also  an  outcome  of  neoliberal   policies  established  in  Mexico  in  the  1970s  and  1980s,  which  left  the  peasant  population   in  miserable  condition.  Privatization  and  the  implementation  of  maquiladoras35  led  the

  `Maquiladoras'  is  a  Spanish  word  that  refers  to  companies  (mainly  manufacturing  companies)  located  in   Mexico,  generally  near  the  border  with  the  United  States.

Mexican  economy  into  a  relationship  of  dependency  on  foreign  investment  (Arzate   2001;  Ramirez  1992;  Ramos  1998  as  cited  in  Binford,  2002).     Neoliberal  principles  in  Canada  have  also  defined  the  structure  of  agri-food   production  and  its  participation  in  the  global  agricultural  market.  The  highly  competitive   nature  of  modern  agriculture  has  transformed  agriculture  in  Canada  into  economies  of   scale.  This,  in  turn,  has  led  to  an  increase  in  volume  of  production  and  farm  size  and  a   reduction  in  costs,  which  is  typically  accomplished  by  cutting  wages.  As  the  number  of   large  farms  increases  to  meet  the  demands  of  production,  the  number  of  small  farms   decreases:  "The  most  recent  census  of  agriculture  shows  that  between  2001  and  2006   there  was  a  seven  percent  decline  in  the  number  of  farms;  this  compares  to  an  11   percent  decline  between  1996  and  2001"  (Agriculture  and  Agri-food  Canada,  2008b  as   cited  in  Preibisch,  2010,  p.430).  In  contrast,  in  1996,  "farms  with  more  than  $250,000  in   sales  represented  10  percent  of  all  farms  and  56  percent  of  total  farm  receipts;  by  2006,   these  farms  represented  17  percent  of  all  farms  and  contributed  almost  75  percent  to   total  farm  receipts"  (Agriculture  and  Agri-food  Canada,  2008b  as  cited  in  Preibisch,   2010,  p.430).   As  with  Caribbean  workers,  the  introduction  of  Mexico  into  the  SAWP  provided   employers  with  means  to  continue  with  now  more  elaborated  labour  segmentation   practices  along  the  lines  of  race.  Over  time  some  employers  found  strategies  for  using   and  adapting  stereotypical  characteristics  of  Mexican  and  Caribbean  workers  according   to  their  needs.  Stereotypes  linked  to  workers'  origin  and  their  language  skills  (or  lack   thereof)  have  been  translated  into  reduction/increase  in  their  desirability.  Concerns  from   employers  and  locals  about  Caribbean  workers  being  prone  to  have  sex  with  Canadian  

81  

     

women  have  made  them  less  desirable.  Employers  also  complain  that  Caribbean   workers'  extended  social  networks  in  Canada  make  them  more  likely  to  acquire   commitments  outside  the  workplace  compared  to  Mexicans.  In  contrast,  Mexicans'   perceived  docility,  eagerness  to  work  longer  hours  and  to  put  up  with  tough  labour   conditions  without  complaining  have  increased  their  appeal  among  Canadian  farmers   (Preibisch  &  Binford,  2007).  Fluctuations  in  the  number  of  workers  representing  different   nationalities  also  reflect  employers'  methods  of  coping  with  difficulties  linked  to   globalization,  international  competition,  environmental  factors,  etc.  In  the  tobacco   industry,  for  example,  changes  in  policies,  reduction  in  tobacco  consumption,  changes   in  weather  and  crop  diseases  have  significantly  altered  the  need  for  Caribbean  labour,   which  have  also  affected  their  wages  (Ramsey,  Stewart,  Troughton  &  Smit,  2003  as   cited  in  Preibisch  &  Binford,  2007).   Unfortunately,  the  converse  is  not  always  true  and  significant  increases  in   production  do  not  necessarily  translate  into  better  conditions  for  workers.  Strong   competition  against  US  producers  and  changes  in  regulations  make  it  difficult  to  stay   afloat  in  the  market,  even  if  a  good  crop  is  yielded.  One  notable  exception  is  in  apple   production,  primarily  in  Ontario,  which  grew  between  the  1980s  and  1990s,  where   prices  fell  relative  to  a  growth  in  foreign  workers'  wages  (Preibisch  &  Binford,  2007).  In   other  sectors,  however,  genuine  economic  growth  did  not  translate  into  an  increase  in   wages  for  TFWs.  Horticulture  and  floriculture,  for  example,  grew  significantly  during  the   1990s,  however,  it  is  documented  that  foreign  workers  continued  to  be  paid  less  than   Canadian  workers  (Basok,  2002).  In  fact,  in  Ontario,  "wages  fell  in  real  terms  for  most   crops  by  an  estimated  7%  between  1992  and  2003"  (Preibisch  &  Binford,  2007  p.11).  

82  

     

Thus,  what  seems  to  be  a  common  denominator  is  that  "many  Canadian  growers  seek   to  displace  the  rising  costs  of  agricultural  land  and  inputs,  as  well  as  to  mitigate  the   effects  of  highly  competitive,  globalized  markets  in  which  retailers  hold  the  upper  hand,   by  minimizing  the  wages  of  the  most  vulnerable  sector  of  the  work  force"  (Binford,  2006   as  cited  in  Preibisch  &  Binford,  2007).  As  a  result,  the  agricultural  labour  force  ends  up   being  racially  segmented  (Binford,  2002)  by  commodity  and/or  country  of  origin   (Preibisch  &  Binford,  2007).   In  this  way,  both  the  LIC  and  the  SAWP  programs  function  by  racializing  and   gendering  temporary  foreign  workers  (Faraday,  2012a),  which  in  a  way  continued  the   racialized  immigration  policies  that  existed  prior  to  the  points  system  (Kelley  &   Trebilcock,  1999;  Triadafilopoulos,  2004).  While  many  theorists  have  questioned  the   stereotypical,  gendered  and  ethnic  basis  for  migration  operative  in  the  selection  of   women  for  live-in  caregiving  jobs  (Bakan  &  Stasiulis,  1994;  Brickner  &  Straehle,  2010;   Grandea  &  Kerr,  1998;  Hsiung  &  Nichol,  2010),  the  continued  existence  of  programs   such  as  LIC  and  SAWP  reaffirms  the  highly  gendered  and  racialized  nature  of   international  migration  programs  (Dauvergne,  2000).  All  in  all,  in  contrast  with  LICs,   temporary  foreign  agricultural  workers  do  not  have  a  pathway  to  permanent  residence   or,  by  extension,  to  citizenship,  which  contributes  significantly  to  their  exploitability   (Basok,  2004;  Hennebry  &  Preibisch,  2012;  Preibisch  &  Binford,  2007;  Preibisch,  2010).   Except  for  live-in  caregivers,  low-skilled  workers  by  and  large  do  not  count  with  a   pathway  to  citizenship.  However,  some  provinces  like  Manitoba,  Alberta  and  British   Columbia  allow  employers  to  nominate  some  low-skilled  (NOC  C  and  D)  workers   through  their  Provincial  Nominee  Program  -  PNP  (Manitoba's  PNP  Website,  Alberta's  

83  

     

PNP  Website  and  BC's  PNP  Website,  2017).  In  Ontario,  the  only  low-skilled  workers   with  access  to  permanent  residence  are  LICs  (Faraday,  2012a).  Thus,  both  citizenship   laws  and  migration  laws  and  programs,  which  are  economically  conceived,  are  the   primary  means  to  impede  citizenship  (Dauvergne,  2000).  Migration  laws  serve  as   façades  of  citizenship  laws  by  taking  charge  of  the  hurdles  linked  to  migration   (Dauvergne,  2000,  p.309)  in  a  way  that  contradicts  principles  of  citizenship  such  as   inclusion,  belonging  and  freedom.   While  mainly  Caribbean  and  Mexican  male  workers36  have  supplied  labour  needs   in  the  agricultural  sector  since  the  1960s  (Palacio,  2010),  (and  Filipino  women   caregiving  needs),  the  Canadian  government  has  recently  opened  doors  to  workers   from  other  regions.  Now  employers  can  select  workers  from  almost  anywhere  in  the   world,  though  in  agriculture  workers  from  Guatemala,  the  Philippines  and  other  Asian   countries  represent  now  the  main  sources.  These  workers  started  to  come  through  the   former  low-skilled  Pilot  Program  (LSPM),  which  provided  access  not  only  to  foreign   agricultural  workers  but  also  to  low-skilled  workers  in  other  occupations.        3.3.  Low-skilled  Workers  in  Other  Occupations        The  third  group  is  comprised  of  all  other  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  workers  

coming  to  Canada  (including  agricultural  workers  coming  through  pathways  other  than   the  SAWP).  These  workers  come  to  Canada  through  the  old  Low-skilled  Pilot  Program,

  Although  SAWP  women  represent  a  small  proportion  of  the  total  SAWPs,  and  research  on  female   temporary  foreign  workers  in  agriculture  is  scarce  (Edmunds  et  al.,  2011),  it  is  evident  that  the  impact  of   working  temporarily  in  Canada  on  these  women  is  significant.  Research  on  female  seasonal  agricultural   workers  in  the  SAWP  reports  mothers'  separation  from  their  children  as  well  as  specific  experiences  of   indentured  labour  (Edmunds  et  al.,  2011;  Hanson,  2007;  Preibisch,  2005;  Preibisch  &  Encalada-Grez,   2010).  Female  SAWs  experience  issues  often  specific  to  being  a  woman,  and  issues  that  can  only  be  fully   understood  within  the  context  of  globalization,  a  globalization  that  is  gendered,  economically  driven  and   mostly  neoliberal  (Edmunds  et  al.,  2011).

which  was  later  transformed  into  the  low-skilled  stream  of  the  TFW  program  and  then   into  the  current  Temporary  Foreign  Worker  Program,  which  includes  most  "low-wage"   workers.  In  2002,  the  federal  government  departed  from  "government  to  government"   low-skilled  programs  (Veena  et  al.,  2002)  and  introduced  the  Low-skilled  Pilot  Program.   In  contrast  with  the  SAWP,  this  program  opened  the  door  to  low-skilled  temporary   foreign  workers  from  anywhere  in  the  world  for  any  low-skilled  occupation  (including   agricultural-related  occupations).   Scarcity  of  labour  in  Alberta's  tar  sands  and  Toronto's  construction  sector   prompted  the  government  to  introduce  the  Low-skilled  Pilot  Program  (LSPP)  in  2002   (Fudge  &  MacPhail,  2009).  This  program  was  designed  to  complement  the  previous  LIC   and  SAW  programs.  When  the  program  was  set  in  place,  the  CIC  made  a  case  for   avoiding  dependency  on  cheap  labour  and  ensuring  that  workers  came  to  fill  genuine   gaps  in  the  labour  market.  Only  jobs  ranked  in  occupations  C  or  D  in  the  NOC  system  of   classifications  were  eligible  (Fudge  &  MacPhail,  2009).  In  the  first  stages  of  the   program,  work  permits  were  one-year  long.  In  contrast  with  high-skilled  workers,  low- skilled  workers  were  not  (and  still  are  not)  allowed  to  bring  their  families.  The  Canadian   government  raised  concerns  about  the  workers'  financial  capacity  to  cover  airfares  and   general  expenses  of  their  families  while  in  Canada  (Fudge  &  MacPhail,  2009).  To   ensure  that  a  low-skilled  TFW  was  not  taking  a  job  from  a  Canadian,  employers  had  to   obtain  a  Labour  Market  Opinion  (LMO),  recently  transformed  into  Labour  Market  Impact   Assessment  (LMIA).37  Following  employers'  lobbying  efforts,  in  2006  the  elected  
                                                                                                 
37

  This  requirement  was  also  in  place  for  high-skilled  workers  not  coming  via  either  provincial  or   international  agreements  (i.e.  GATs  and  NAFTA).  It  also  did  not  apply  to  workers  coming  under  Canadian   interest  categories  and  other  non-LMIA  required  pathways.             

85  

     

Conservative  government  modified  the  TFW  program  to  make  it  more  accessible  to   employers.  TFW  support  centers  were  opened  in  the  main  urban  centers  across   Canada  to  assist  employers  in  obtaining  LMOs  and  work  permits.  In  coordination  with   the  provincial  governments  of  Alberta  and  British  Columbia,  the  government  initiated   working  groups,  which  were  tasked  with  establishing  lists  of  occupations  under  pressure   to  help  employers  with  the  process  of  obtaining  temporary  foreign  labour  (Fudge  &   MacPhail,  2009).  The  first  list  in  BC  included  more  than  230  occupations;  in  future   iterations,  this  list  would  change  to  have  a  heavier  low-skilled  composition  (Fudge  &   MacPhail,  2009).   In  2007,  the  duration  of  work  permits  was  extended  from  one  year  to  two  years.   Between  2007  and  2010  the  Expedited  Labour  Market  Opinion  (E-LMO)  pilot  project   (Gross,  2014)  was  set  in  place.  This  pilot  project  allowed  select  employers  in  select   occupations  to  obtain  LMOs  in  three  to  five  days  (Fudge  &  MacPhail  2009).  These   changes  boosted  the  use  of  the  TFW  program  significantly  (more  than  a  100%   increase),  especially  in  low-skilled  occupations.  These  selected  occupations,  which   include  low-skilled  positions  in  construction,  hospitality,  and  tourism,  accounted  for  25%   of  the  combined  volume  of  regular  requests  for  LMOs  in  Alberta  and  British  Columbia.  In   2008,  twenty-one  additional  occupations,  including  food  and  beverage  services  and   residential  cleaning  and  support  workers,  were  added  to  the  pilot,  covering  50%  of  the   combined  total  of  requests  for  LMOs  from  the  two  provinces.  More  than  230,000   requests  for  temporary  foreign  workers  were  received  by  HRSDC  in  2007,  up  from   150,000  requests  in  2006  (Fudge  &  MacPhail  2009,  p.  27).  

86  

     

According  to  Foster  (2012),  the  Temporary  Foreign  Worker  Program  in  Canada   transitioned  from  a  program  designed  to  address  short-term  labour  market  needs  into  a   program  that  has  brought  a  significant  number  of  TFWs,  especially  low-skilled  workers,   to  Canada  (Foster,  2012).  Between  2006  and  2007,  TFW  applications  grew  four-fold  in   Alberta  (Fudge  &  MacPhail,  2009).  In  response  to  a  corresponding  increase  in  abuse   and  complaints,  unions  voiced  their  concern  with  the  exponential  increase  of  the  TFW   program.  Although  the  TFW  program  is  federally  operated,  the  federal  government   objected  that,  because  labour  protection  is  a  provincial  domain,  it  was  up  to  the   provinces  to  introduce  mechanisms  of  protection.  Despite  this  initial  effort  to  shirk   responsibility,  the  federal  government  later  introduced  protective  measures,  including:   "developing  memoranda  of  understanding  with  provincial  governments  to  improve   cooperation  on  matters  concerning  employment  standards;  amending  the  IRPA  to   prevent  vulnerable  foreign  workers  from  being  exploited  or  abused;  and  developing   mechanisms  to  monitor  employer  compliance  with  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the   TFWP  as  well  as  a  formal  process  to  address  instances  of  noncompliance"  (Fudge  &   MacPhail,  2009,  p.  29).   In  2007,  mechanisms,  including  changes  to  the  contract  between  employer  and   employee,  were  set  in  place.  Such  changes,  however,  were  not  enforceable  by  the   federal  government  and  each  party  was  responsible  for  being  informed  about  its  rights   and  responsibilities  (Fudge  &  MacPhail,  2009).  Provinces  also  passed  laws  to  protect   foreign  workers  (ex.  Manitoba's  Worker  Recruitment  and  Protection  Act  and  Ontario's   Employment  Protection  for  Foreign  Nationals  Act  (Live-in  Caregivers  and  Others)).   However,  some  provinces  (including  those  with  the  highest  number  of  TFWs,  namely  

87  

     

Ontario  and  Alberta)  still  do  not  allow  agricultural  workers  to  unionize,  depriving  them  of   collective  bargaining  rights  (Fudge  &  MacPhail,  2009).  Quebec,  however,  does  allow  it.   Mechanisms  of  enforcement  were  also  introduced,  but  most  of  them  were  voluntary   (Fudge  &  MacPhail  2009).  Further  changes  were  made  to  the  TFW  program  to  ease   hiring  processes.  In  2009  lists  of  occupations  were  eliminated  and  employers  only  had   to  advertise  their  job  postings  for  14  days  (Gross,  2014).  In  2011,  the  maximum  length   of  time  that  foreign  workers  could  stay  in  Canada  was  increased  from  two  to  four  years.   The  E-LMO  process  was  introduced  in  2007,  initially  for  12  occupations  but  then  was   further  expanded  in  2008  to  include  33  occupations,  only  to  be  eliminated  in  2010   (Gross,  2014).  Other  policies  were  designed  to  regulate  wages  for  TFWs.  Since  2012,   employers  can  pay  low-skilled  workers  5%  below  the  median  wage,  ostensibly  to  avoid   paying  TFWs  wages  above  those  of  some  nationals.  In  fact,  TFWs  were  likely  to  be  paid   the  median  wage  for  the  specific  occupation  in  the  region/province  where  the  job  takes   place.   Other  measures  were  taken  to  allow  employers  "to  offer  high-skilled  TFWs  up  to   15  percent  less  than  the  median  wage  and  low-skilled  TFWs  5  percent  less  as  long  as  it   remained  above  the  minimum  wage"  (Gross,  2014,  p.7).  The  Accelerated  LMO  (A-LMO)   was  introduced  to  allow  employers  hiring  workers  in  occupations  NOC  0,  A  and  B  to   obtain  the  LMO  within  10  business  days  (Gross,  2014).  Both  measures  functioned  to   significantly  increase  the  number  of  TFWs  coming  to  Canada.  In  2008,  British  Columbia   and  Alberta  had  accessed  more  than  twice  the  number  of  workers  in  the  rest  of  Canada,   combined  (Gross,  2014).  Complaints  from  advocacy  groups  and  pressure  from  the   media  prompted  the  government  to  make  changes,  including  the  elimination  of  the  very  

88  

     

unpopular  pay  of  5%/15%  below  median  wage  and  the  A-LMO;  posts  were  to  be   advertised  for  four  weeks;  and  jobs  were  to  require  speaking  only  one  of  Canada's   official  languages  (Gross,  2014).  An  LMO  processing  fee  was  also  introduced  and   requiring  other  languages  (different  to  Canada's  official  languages)  was  allowed  only  if  it   was  strictly  related  to  the  job  description.        All  these  changes  led  to  significant  increases  in  TFWs,  which  in  some  cases  

appears  to  have  harmed  provincial  economies.  Gross  argues  that  temporary  foreign   worker  programs  make  sense  when  there  are  low  unemployment  rates  in  specific   regions  or  in  specific  industries  or  occupations.  Between  2002  and  2012,  policy   changes  were  implemented  that  eased  employer's  access  to  TFWs,  but  unemployment   rates  either  remained  the  same  or  even  increased.  Some  of  those  increases  were   caused  in  part  by  the  employers'  easy  access  to  TFWs  (Gross,  2014).   Easing  the  rules  to  access  TFWs  was  a  response  to  supposed  shortages  in  the   labour  market.  A  lack  of  accurate  information  with  which  to  nuance  and  identify  clear   labour  needs  led  to  the  creation  of  the  Accelerated  LMO  and  the  E-LMO  pilot  projects   that  ended  up  increasing  unemployment  rates,  especially  in  provinces  with  the  highest   consumption  of  TFWs:  Alberta  and  British  Columbia  (Gross,  2014).   Up  to  the  present  day,  the  Canadian  government  still  seems  to  be  experimenting  with   the  Canadian  labour  market.  Under  the  government  of  Stephen  Harper,  temporary   foreign  labour  was  used  to  respond  to  labour  needs,  but  lacked  the  substantial  research   needed  to  evaluate  policy  outcomes.  Policies  were  simply  set  in  place  with  little   empirical  evidence  about  labour  shortages  or  consultation.  The  number  of  policy   changes  between  2002  and  2013  was  significant  and  many  policies  came  and  left  in  a  

89  

     

matter  of  a  few  years.  In  general,  policies  were  introduced  to  create  incentives  for   employers  to  use  temporary  foreign  labour  as  opposed  to  domestic  labour  (Gross,   2014).  While  pressure  from  the  media,  academics  and  advocacy  groups  prompted  an   entire  overhaul  of  the  system  presented  in  2014,  which  included  changing  basic   methodologies  and  assumptions  underlying  foreign  low-skilled  labour  (i.e.  a  move  from   skills  to  wages)  (CIC,  2014),  many  of  these  changes  have  been  criticized,  especially  in   how  they  relate  to  low-skilled  workers  (Faraday,  2016).  Critics  argue  that  some  changes   extended  and  even  exacerbated  the  precariousness  workers'  conditions  (Faraday,   2016).  The  significant  number  and  rapid  turnover  of  changes,  both  in  the  economy  and   in  policy,  have  made  immigration  policy  analysis  and  research  incredibly  volatile  and,  by   extension,  difficult  to  analyze.  Not  surprisingly,  the  practice  of  introducing  a  significant   number  of  changes  without  a  significant  body  of  research  and  analysis  led  to  ineffective   policymaking  that  needed  constant  revisions.          3.4.

As  of  July  1,  2016,  ESDC  offers  employers  four  pathways  to  hire  low-skilled   workers:  The  Live-in  Caregiver  Program,  the  Seasonal  Agricultural  Worker  Program,  the   Agricultural  Stream,  and  the  Low  Wage  Stream.      3.4.1.  The  Live-in  Caregiver  Program.  This  stream  allows  employers  to  hire   live-in  caregivers  for  children  and  for  people  with  high  medical  demands.  Caregivers  for   children  work  in  occupation  NOC  6474-Live-in  Caregivers  and  Nannies.  Caregivers  for   high  medical  needs  can  work  in  any  of  the  four  following  occupations:  NOC  3413  Nurse   Aides,  Orderlies  and  Patient  Service  Associates,  NOC  6471  Visiting  Homemakers  and   Housekeepers  and  Related  Occupations  (ESDC,  2016c).  Employers  hiring  workers   under  this  program  are  required  to  apply  for  a  Labour  Market  Impact  Assessment   (LMIA),  which  provides  a  way  to  signal  that  the  worker  will  not  affect  the  Canadian   labour  market.  Live-in  caregivers  require  fluency  in  either  English  or  French  and   demonstrated  work  experience  (ESDC,  2016c)38.  Employers  are  required  to  provide   proof  of  the  individual  requiring  care  and  financial  ability  and  to  pay  transportation  fees   for  low-wage39  LICs  (from  their  country  of  origin  to  the  place  of  work  in  Canada)  (ESDC,   2016c).  The  previously  long-standing  requirement  that  caregivers  live  in  the  employer's   house  no  longer  holds.  However,  if  the  employer  does  offer  accommodations,  they  must   be  private,  furnished,  with  a  bedroom  door  that  has  a  lock  and  bolt,  and  in  the  home  of   the  person  in  need  of  care.     Employers  must  also  provide  health  Insurance  and  an  employment  contract,   which  meets  the  minimum  wage  for  the  occupation  in  the  region  of  work.  They  must  pay  
                                                                                                 
38

  In  addition  to  at  least  six  months  of  training  and  relevant  caregiving  experience,  eligibility  to  the  LIC   program  also  demands  fluency  in  one  of  Canada's  official  languages  (Sweetman  &  Warman,  2010)   39   See  Stream  for  Low-wage  Positions  in  this  chapter.

any  overtime  and  ensure  provision  of  due  breaks  and  holidays  as  well  as  a  safe   workplace  (ESDC,  2016c).  Live-in  caregivers  are  eligible  to  apply  for  permanent   residence  after  two  years  of  work.  The  Live-in  Caregiver  Program  is  the  only  federally   run  temporary  foreign  worker  program  with  a  pathway  to  citizenship  (ESDC,  2016c).   However,  as  will  be  explained  in  this  chapter,  changes  introduced  in  2014  made   eligibility  more  restrictive  and  not  entirely  guaranteed  (Faraday,  2016).      3.4.2.  The  Seasonal  Agricultural  Workers  Program  (SAWP).  This  program   was  initially  conceived  as  a  government  to  government  program.  In  contrast  with  other   low-skilled  TFW  programs  in  agriculture,  in  this  program,  the  sending  country  is  also   involved  (Hennebry  &  Preibisch,  2012).  This  program  is  the  outcome  of  agreements   reached  between  the  Canadian  government  and  the  governments  of  Barbados,   Jamaica,  Mexico,  Trinidad  and  Tobago  and  the  Organization  of  Eastern  Caribbean   States  (Hennebry,  2012).  Under  this  program,  employers  can  only  hire  TFW  workers   from  these  countries  and  must  follow  the  regulations  stemming  from  the  agreements   with  these  countries  (Hennebry,  2012).  Participants  of  the  program  must  be  experienced   farm  workers  and  at  least  18  years  old.  The  work  is  restricted  to  primary  farm  work   (within  the  confines  of  a  farm,  nursery  or  greenhouse)  and  the  worker  can  be  hired  for  a   maximum  of  eight  months  (ESDC,  2016d).  The  employer  is  responsible  for  paying  for   the  worker's  round-trip,  although  a  portion  of  the  expenses  may  be  recovered  through   payroll  deductions.  Employers  are  expected  to  provide  housing  (except  in  British   Columbia),  an  employment  contract,  proof  of  a  functioning  business,  and  to  pay  work

permit  fees.40  Employers  must  ensure  that  workers  are  registered  on  a  provincial  or   territorial  health  plan  as  soon  as  they  become  eligible  (ESDC,  2016d).  Health  coverage   during  the  waiting  period  represents  a  bit  of  a  grey  area  because  there  is  no  explicit   regulation,  except  in  Ontario,  where  health  care  is  provided  upon  arrival  (Hennebry  &   Preibisch,  2016).     Employees  are  technically  allowed  to  transfer  from  one  farm  to  another,  but  only   with  the  approval  of  both  sending  and  receiving  employers,  which  is  very  difficult  to   obtain  (Hennebry,  2012).  Adding  to  this  difficulty,  the  worker's  legal  status  is  tied  to  the   employer  (Hennebry,  2012),  which  means  that  the  process  of  job  termination  ends  in   deportation.  Employers  are  required  to  prove  attempts  to  recruit  Canadians  (or   permanent  residents),  before  offering  a  position  to  a  TFW.  They  must  then  obtain  a   LMIA.41  Wages  and  benefits  must  be  the  same  for  TFWs  as  what  is  offered  to   Canadians  and  permanent  residents,  a  legislation  that  is  brought  into  question  in  this   dissertation.     Interviews  with  a  former  official  in  charge  of  the  SAWP  suggest  that  the  program   provides  a  model  for  temporary  migration  because  it  "recognizes  and  responds  to   legitimate  labor  shortages  in  the  economy,  ...  [has  a]  formal  structure...  [ensuring]  that   all  the  key  players  are  engaged  and  that  the  workers'  rights  are  clearly  understood,   outlined,  and  enforced  through  agreements,  memoranda  of  understanding,  and   operations  guidelines"  (Basok,  2007).  However,  the  program's  emphasis  on  the   employer  and  its  restriction  of  workers'  mobility,  both  in  the  labour  market  and  various   social  contexts,  lead  to  flaws  at  the  level  of  integration  and  access  to  rights  (Basok,

2007).      3.4.3.  The  Agricultural  Stream  to  Hire  Temporary  Foreign  Agricultural   Workers.  Employers  in  the  agriculture  sector  also  have  the  option  to  hire  low-skilled   temporary  workers.  In  contrast  with  SAWP,  which  restricts  the  countries  from  which   workers  can  be  hired,  the  agriculture  stream  is  not  the  outcome  of  a  concerted   agreement  between  nations  and  employers  are  allowed  to  hire  workers  from  any   country  in  the  world  (Preibisch,  2012).  Workers  can  be  hired  for  up  to  two  years,  which   can  then  be  extended  to  four  years.  This  is  the  maximum  period  a  TFW  can  work   continuously  in  Canada,  after  which  point  it  is  necessary  to  wait  another  four  years   before  being  eligible  to  apply  for  another  TFW  work  permit  (ESDC,  2016d).  Depending   on  the  province  or  territory  in  which  the  job  takes  place,  specific  application  processes   may  apply.  Before  applying  for  a  TFW,  employers  must  demonstrate  attempts  to  hire   Canadians  or  permanent  residents.  They  must  then  apply  for  a  LMIA.  Employers  must   cover  round-trip  travel  expenses  and  provide  either  onsite  or  offsite  housing,  the  costs   of  which  can  be  deducted  from  a  worker's  salary  up  to  a  maximum  of  30  dollars  per   week.  Employers  must  pay  for  the  private  health  insurance  of  their  employees.  As  with   SAWPs,  workers  under  this  stream  must  be  paid  the  same  wage  as  Canadians  and   permanent  residents  (ESDCd,  2016d).        3.4.4.  Stream  for  Low-wage  Positions.  This  stream  officially  allows  employers   to  hire  full-time  temporary  foreign  workers  for  a  wage  that  is  below  the   provincial/territorial  median  hourly  wage  for  the  occupation  and  in  the  region  where  the  

94  

     

job  will  take  place.  Any  employer  offering  wages  below  the  provincial/territorial  median   must  abide  by  the  regulations  of  this  stream.  Applications  in  this  stream  will  be  rejected   if  the  three  following  rejection  criteria  are  met:  the  unemployment  rate  in  the  region   where  the  job  will  take  place  is  6%  or  higher;  the  occupation  is  classified  within  the   North  American  Industry  Classification  System  (NAICS)  as  either  NAICS  72   Accommodation  and  Food  Service  or  NAICS  44-45  Retail  Trade;  or  the  position  is  in   any  of  the  following  NOC  occupations:   1.   Food  counter  attendants,  kitchen  helpers  and  related  occupations  (NOC  6641);   2.   Light  duty  cleaners  (NOC  6661);   3.   Cashiers  (NOC  6611);   4.   Grocery  clerks  and  store  shelf  stockers  (NOC  6622);   5.   Construction  trades  and  labourers  (NOC  7611);   6.   Landscaping  and  grounds  maintenance  labourers  (NOC  8612);   7.   Other  attendants  in  accommodation  and  travel  (NOC  6672);   8.   Janitors,  caretakers  and  building  superintendents  (NOC  6663);   9.   Specialized  cleaners  (NOC  6662);  
10.  Security  guards  and  related  occupations  (NOC  6651)     

Employers  are  charged  $1  000  for  each  position  requested  (LMIA  fees),  and   recovering  this  fee  is  forbidden.  Employers  hiring  workers  with  wages  below  the   provincial  or  territorial  median  are  subject  to  a  cap  on  the  number  of  TFWs  hired  (a   maximum  of  20%  of  the  employer's  labour  force).  Exemptions  to  the  cap  are  made  for:   agricultural  and  caregiving  occupations;  positions  that  will  become  permanent  via  

95  

     

express  entry42;  employers  with  less  than  10  employees  nationally  (including  the   position  to  be  filled)  (ESDC,  2016e).  From  February  2016  until  the  end  of  2016,  the   federal  government  extended  exemptions  to  all  seasonal  jobs  (up  to  180  days)   (Faraday,  2016).  It  is  noteworthy  that  exemptions  to  the  cap  primarily  cover  agricultural   workers  and  live-in  caregivers,  which  comprise  the  highest  number  of  TFWs  in  Canada.   Exploitation  in  these  occupations  has  already  been  amply  documented  (Hennebry,   2012;  Preibisch  &  Binford,  2007)  and  a  two-tiered  wage  system  creates  a  "patchwork  of   differential  rights  and  pockets  of  permanent  precarity"  (Faraday,  2016,  p.31).  Eligible   jobs  cannot  require  languages  other  than  English  or  French,  unless  the  employer  can   demonstrate  that  another  language  is  essential  for  the  job,  but  low-skilled  occupations   may  require  previous  work  experience.  Round-trip  transportation  costs  are  borne  by  the   employer  and  must  be  presented  up  front  in  order  to  protect  the  workers  from  being   offered  other  transportation  arrangements  in  exchange  for  a  contract  (ESDC,  2016e).   The  employer  is  not  obliged  to  provide  housing  but  must  ensure  that  affordable  housing   is  available;  he  or  she  must  arrange  and  to  pay  for  employee  safety  insurance;  and,  if   the  job  is  unionized,  must  follow  specific  regulations.  Employers  must  also  prove  that   they  attempted  to  hire  Canadians  (or  permanent  residents)  and  then  they  need  to  obtain   an  LMIA.  (ESDC,  2016e).      3.4.5.  Most  Recent  Changes  Affecting  Low-Skilled  TFWs.  The  report  on  the   TFW  program  presented  at  the  Standing  Committee  on  Human  Resources,  Skills  and

  Express  Entry  is  the  system  used  by  the  Canadian  federal  government  to  manage  applications  for   permanent  residence  in  some  federal  and  provincial  programs  including  the  Federal  Skilled  Worker   Program,  the  Federal  Skilled  Trades  Programs  and  the  Canadian  Experience  Class  Program  (IRCC,   2017).       

96  

     

Social  Development  and  the  Status  of  Persons  with  Disabilities  in  September  2016   (HUMA)  states  that  employers  hiring  low-wage  workers  are  subjected  to  a  cap  in  the   number  of  workers,  now  at  20%  of  the  total  employed  labour  force  in  an  enterprise.  In   July  2017  it  will  be  lowered  to  10%  (HUMA,  2016).  The  cap  does  not  apply  to   "employers  with  fewer  than  ten  employees  nationally  or  to  positions  in  on-farm  primary   agriculture,  caregiving,  highly  mobile  positions  that  cross  provincial,  territorial  and/or   international  boundaries,  and  positions  that  last  for  fewer  than  120  days.  In  February   2016,  the  government  added  an  exemption  for  any  low-wage  `seasonal'  positions  that   last  no  more  than  180  days"  (Faraday,  2016  p.24).  Affected  employers,  especially  in  the   seafood  industry  in  the  Maritimes,  meat  processing  industry  in  Manitoba  and  fishing   industry  in  Prince  Edward  Island,  complained  that  the  cap  negatively  affects  productivity   (HUMA,  2016).  Another  complaint  is  that  the  cap's  calculation  for  exempted  seasonal   occupations  was  unfair  (HUMA,  2016).  Some  of  these  regions  experience  significant   labour  shortages  linked  to  interprovincial  migration  and  migration  of  youth  (Harling- Stalker  &  Phyne,  2014).   While  some  industries  and  occupations  may  experience  genuine  labour   shortages,  it  is  worth  noting  that  some  exemptions  take  place  in  occupations  with  the   highest  number  of  TFWs  (caregiving  and  agriculture).  Proposed  suggestions  for   effectively  implementing  the  cap  on  TFWs  include  the  suggestion  that  "greater  micro   labour  market  data  be  collected  and  that  the  cap  be  frozen  at  levels  that  are  supported   by  LMIA  labour  needs  ...  [and,  that]  the  seafood  sector  be  covered  under  the  primary   agriculture  stream"  (HUMA,  2016,  p.17).  The  committee  recommended  the  cap  to  be  set   at  a  minimum  of  20%  with  "further  review  sector  and  geographic  considerations"  

97  

     

(HUMA,  2016,  p.32).        Another  restriction  extracted  from  the  changes  introduced  in  November  2014  is  

to  refrain  from  processing  "LMIA  applications  for  certain  low-wage  positions  in  the   Accommodation,  Food  Services  and  Retail  Trade  sectors  in  economic  regions  with  a   6%  or  higher  unemployment  rate"  (HUMA,  2016,  p.16).  Representatives  of  the  Hotel   Association  of  Canada  explained  how  these  restrictions  have  significantly  affected  their   industry,  arguing  that  they  have  tried  "multiple  initiatives  to  recruit  Canadians  first,   including  some  targeting  Indigenous  peoples"  (HUMA,  2016,  p.16).  The  report  also   raises  concerns  on  inaccuracies  on  regional  unemployment  rates,  since  such   calculations  are  based  on  high-level  data,  which  is  not  granular  enough  and  hence   unreliable  (HUMA,  2016).  Proposed  solutions  include  the  creation  of  a  "Seasonal   Lodging  Worker  Program  to  recognize  the  seasonality  of  the  hospitality  industry  and   that  some  tourism  jobs,  such  as  foreign  language  tour  guides,  be  moved  from  the  low- skill  to  the  high-skill  category"  (HUMA,  2016,  p.17).  Acknowledging  the  need  for  further   studies  to  evaluate  the  impact  on  workers  and  industries  of  introducing  other  seasonal   temporary  foreign  worker  programs,  the  committee  proposed  that  "Employment  and   Social  Development  Canada  take  immediate  steps  to  improve  the  collection  of  labour   market  data  and  review  the  geographic  zones  used  for  determining  unemployment   rates,  with  a  view  to  aligning  the  labour  market  conditions  of  more  localized  economies   with  the  requirements  of  the  Temporary  Foreign  Worker  Program"  (HUMA,  2016,  p.31).   One  more  restriction  introduced  in  2014  to  address  low-skilled  workers  is  a   reduction  in  the  length  of  stay  for  low-wage  workers'  work  permits  from  two  years  to  one   year  (Faraday,  2016).  Another  significant  recommendation  was  number  16:  "That  

98  

     

Immigration,  Refugees  and  Citizenship  Canada  review  the  current  pathways  to   permanent  residency  for  all  temporary  foreign  workers,  with  a  view  to  facilitating  access   to  permanent  residency  for  migrant  workers  who  have  integrated  into  Canadian  society   and  are  filling  a  permanent  labour  market  need"  (HUMA,  2016,  p.  32).  The  committee   acknowledged  the  need  for  workers  who  are  contributing  to  the  Canadian  economy  to   have  a  pathway  to  Canadian  Citizenship  (HUMA,  2016).   The  introduction  of  the  2014  changes  also  resulted  in  specific  policy  changes  in   the  Live-in  Caregiver  Program  (LCP),  especially  related  to  its  pathway  to  permanent   residence.  The  former  LIC  program  guaranteed  all  participants  access  to  permanent   residence  after  two  years  of  work  as  TFWs.  Under  the  new  program,  the  federal   government  created  two  capped  streams  (The  Caring  for  Children  Class  and  the  Caring   for  People  with  High  Medical  Needs  Class),  each  of  which  allowed  up  to  2  750  places   for  permanent  residence  a  year  (Farady,  2016).  In  the  year  before  the  ruling  came  into   place  (November  2014),  the  federal  government  had  approved  13  335  caregiving   positions  on  LMIAs43  (Faraday,  2016).  In  2015  and  2016  the  number  of  approved   caregiver  LMIAs  dropped  significantly  to  3  983  in  2015  and  to  3  128  in  the  first  two   quarters  of  2016  (ESDC,  2016i).  If  the  quota  is  already  filled  when  applying  for   permanent  residence,  IRCC  advises  caregivers  to  either  wait  until  the  next  year  or  to   apply  in  any  of  the  other  PR  streams  (Faraday,  2016).  This  new  approach  introduces   considerably  more  insecurity  since  permanent  residence  is  no  longer  guaranteed   (Faraday,  2016).  Although  the  number  of  caregivers  coming  to  Canada  dropped   significantly  after  the  changes,  there  is  no  legislation  that  caps  the  number  of  LMIAs   issued,  which  depends  on  employers'  demand  (Faraday,  2016).  The  low  numbers  of

LICs  also  raises  questions  of  an  imminent  scarcity  of  caregivers,  since  the  number  of   caregiving-LMIAs  has  dropped  by  approximately  70%  (from  13  335  to  3  983).   In  summary,  recommendations  in  the  HUMA  report  address  issues  including   LMIA  processes  and  fees,  pathways  to  permanent  residence,  monitoring  and  enforcing.   The  report  raises  issues  related  to  the  LIC  program,  including  the  existence  of  a  backlog   of  38  000  applicants  expecting  a  decision  and  cases  taking  an  average  of  49  months  to   process  (HUMA,  2016).  Although  there  is  no  mention  of  removing  the  cap  on  the  LIC   program,  the  report  recommends  pathways  to  permanent  residence  for  all  migrant   workers  (HUMA,  2016).   As  this  thesis  is  being  written,  more  changes  in  the  TFW  program  have  occurred.   On  December  13,  2016,  Immigration,  Refugees  and  Citizenship  Canada  issued   changes  to  the  TFW  program,  including,  1)  the  elimination  of  the  four  cumulative  year   rule  (four  years  in  and  four  years  out)  in  place  since  April  2011;  2)  low-wage  employers   are  now  obliged  to  "advertise  to  more  than  one,  and  up  to  four,  under-represented   groups  in  the  workforce--youth,  persons  with  disabilities,  Indigenous  people  and   newcomers"  (IRCC  website,  2016a)  before  trying  to  hire  a  low-wage  TFW;  and  3)  the   cap  on  low-wage  workers  will  be  kept  at  20  "for  employers  who  accessed  the  program   prior  to  June  20,  2014,  and  at  10  percent  for  new  users  of  the  program  after  that  date.   The  exemption  on  the  cap  for  seasonal  industries  seeking  temporary  foreign  workers  for   up  to  180  days  during  the  2017  calendar  year  will  be  extended  until  December  31,   2017"  (IRCC  website,  2016a).

Summary      The  reasons  for  low  wages  among  low-skilled  non-citizens  are  diverse  and  range  

from  a  colonial  legacy  to  policy  makers'  entrenched  ideas,  from  lobbying  efforts  of   employers  to  the  economic  devastation  abroad  caused  by  neoliberal  policies.  Whatever   the  reasons,  citizenship  or  a  lack  thereof  has  been  used  as  a  means  to  articulate  and   validate  low  wages  among  low-skilled  non-citizens.  While  variables  related  to  either  the   workers  themselves  (gender,  age,  country  of  birth,  level  of  education,  etc.)  or  to  the   work  setting  (rural/urban  location,  province  of  residence)  are  likely  to  influence  wage   difference,  citizenship  (or  lack  thereof)  is  the  most  significant  factor.     The  low  wages  earned  by  TFWs  can  be  traced  back  to  the  time  when  programs  were   introduced  to  bring  temporary  foreign  workers  to  Canada.  While  employer  needs   significantly  drive  TFW  policy,  this  chapter  detailed  the  ways  in  which  they  are  not  the   sole  factor  determining  the  number  of  TFWs  in  the  labour  market.  If  that  were  the  case,   the  number  of  TFWs  would  be  significantly  higher  (as  shown  in  chapter  one,  the   proportion  is  very  small,  around  1.7%  of  the  labour  force).  Government  policies  also   exert  influence,  insofar  as  they  respond  to  labour  needs  and  weigh  the  needs  of   different  stakeholders  and  regions  in  Canada.  The  ruling  government  party  navigates   these  needs  while  keeping  its  own  political  agenda  in  mind  (Carty  et  al.,  2007).  The  next   chapter  provides  the  methodology  followed  to  evaluate  wage  differences  as  well  as  the   impact  of  lack  of  citizenship  and  other  variables  including  sex  and  province  of  residence   on  wages  of  low-skilled  Non-Permanent  Residents  (NPRS).  It  will  also  introduce  the   methodology  to  evaluate  whether  wages  concentrate  around  either  low  or  high  values   (as  demonstrated  through  quartile  analysis  of  wages).

Chapter  Four:  Methods,  Considerations  and  Methodological  Challenges      Using  quantitative  methods,  this  dissertation  compares  the  wages  of  low-skilled  

NPRs  against  those  of  two  specific  groups:  low-skilled  immigrants  (IMM)  (naturalized   immigrants  and  permanent  residents)  and  low-skilled  Canadian-born  workers  (CB).  The   data  source  used  must  accordingly  include  information  about  all  three  groups  (NPR,   IMM,  CB)  as  well  as  the  variables  that  will  serve  to  compare  the  three  groups.  This   chapter  is  divided  into  eight  main  sections.  In  the  first  section  I  provide  a  general   description  of  the  problem,  the  research  questions.  In  the  second  section  I  present  a   general  description  of  methods  used  in  this  dissertation.  In  the  third  section  I  present  the   process  I  used  to  select  the  dataset  (2006  census  data).  In  the  fourth  section  I  gather   information  about  all  the  variables  I  used  in  the  analysis,  including  justifications  for  their   use  and  criteria  for  selection  of  categories  in  each  variable.  Variables  include:  wages   (dependent  variable),  age,  province  of  residence  and  country  of  birth  (independent   variables).  In  the  fifth  section  I  focus  on  the  criteria  for  selection  of  populations  used  in   the  analysis  (i.e.  who  is  included  in  the  NPR  population).  In  the  sixth  section  I  present   the  limitations  I  faced  throughout  the  analysis.  In  the  seventh  section  I  introduce  a  high- level  explanation  of  the  quartile  analysis.  This  type  of  analysis  is  of  central  importance  in   the  wage  analysis  in  chapter  six  to  evaluate  whether  wages  concentrate  around  either   low  or  high  values.  In  the  eighth  section  I  explain  the  tests  used  in  the  analysis  (ANOVA   and  Post  Hoc  (Bonferroni)).  These  tests  evaluate  the  comparability  of  the  means.  
  

4.1.  Problem  and  Questions     4.1.1.  The  Problem.  Existing  research  suggests  that  a  lack  of  citizenship  renders   foreign  low-skilled  workers  vulnerable  to  exploitation.  This  dissertation  explores  the   102  
     

effect  that  citizenship  (or  a  lack  thereof)44  has  on  the  wages  of  low-skilled  NPRs   compared  to  those  with  citizenship  (or  with  access  to  most  citizenship  rights)  in  different   layers  of  analysis  including  sex,  province  of  residence,  level  of  education  and  country  of   birth.  Because  the  layers  of  analysis  are  central  to  this  research  work,  most  of  the   dissertation  introduces  a  significant  level  of  detail  that  is  presented  in  many  categories   and  subcategories  of  analysis.  These  categories  and  subcategories  help  to  guide  the   granularity  of  analysis  present  across  the  dissertation,  especially  this  chapter  on   methodologies  as  well  as  the  quantitative  chapters  (five,  six,  seven  and  eight).    
  

4.1.2.  Research  Questions.  This  dissertation  addresses  the  following  question:   To  what  extent  does  the  policy-created  lack  of  citizenship,  combined  with  intrinsic   characteristics  of  workers  (age,  sex,  level  of  education  ability  to  speak  English  or   French,  or  place  of  birth)  and  their  occupations  (provincial  location,  urban/rural  setting)   affect  the  wages  of  low-skilled  NPR  workers  in  Canada?     In  Canada,  no  study  has  compared  wages  among  low-skilled  workers  from  the   perspectives  of  legal  status  and  occupation.  A  literature  review  also  reveals  a  lack  of   systematic  studies  in  Canada  that  examine  wage  differences  by  immigration  status  and   other  intrinsic  characteristics  (of  NPRs  themselves  and  their  occupations)  already   mentioned.  Understanding  wage  differences  in  view  of  these  characteristics  allows  us  to

  While  both  naturalized  immigrants  (immigrant  with  citizenship)  and  permanent  residents  (immigrants   without  citizenship)  have  somewhat  similar  rights  and  privileges  in  Canada,  some  differences  persist.   Only  citizens  have  the  right  to  vote  and  have  access  to  the  Canadian  passport;  and  permanent  positions   that  require  high-level  security  clearance  are  restricted  to  those  individuals  with  Canadian  citizenship   (Government  of  Canada,  2015).  However,  most  low-skilled  occupations  have  no  restrictions  linked  to   citizenship  status.  Since  both  naturalized  citizens  and  permanent  residents  have  equal  rights  with  respect   to  access  to  most  low-skilled  occupations,  there  is  no  distinction  in  this  research  between  the  two  groups.   Both  are  merged  together  and  considered  as  one  group  throughout  the  analysis.  In  this  analysis,  this   group  is  called  `immigrants'  or  `IMM'  whether  naturalized  or  not.

zero  in  on  the  specificities  of  wage  discrepancies.  More  detailed  information  also  stands   to  improve  future  analyses  and  achieve  more  accurate  policymaking.  Finally,  reviewing   the  literature  on  TFW  policymaking  helps  us  evaluate  the  role  of  the  state  in  maintaining   workers'  status  as  noncitizens.  Let  me  now  recall  the  specific  questions  that  this   research  addresses:   Question  One:  What  are  the  demographics  of  low-skilled  labour  in  Canada?   Question  Two:  Do  wages  of  low-skilled  workers  concentrate  around  either  low   or  high  wages?   Question  Three:  How  large  are  the  wage  differences  between  NPRs  and  CB   and  between  NPRs  and  IMM  in  each  industry  sector  and  occupation  analyzed  in  this   dissertation?   Question  Four:  How  large  are  the  wage  differences  between  NPRs  and  CB  and   between  NPRs  and  IMM  by  intrinsic  characteristics  of  workers  (sex,  level  of  education,   ability  to  speak  English  or  French,  or  place  of  birth)  and  their  occupations  (provincial   location,  urban/rural  setting)  in  all  occupations  analyzed  in  this  study?   Question  Five:  How  large  is  the  effect  of  lacking  citizenship  on  the  wages  of   NPRs  if  the  variations  on  wages  linked  to  intrinsic  characteristics  of  workers  above  (age   included)  of  low-skilled  NPRs  are  held  constant?   Question  Six:  Are  wage  differences  the  consequence  of  citizenship-related   policies  in  place?   While  no  studies  have  compared  NPRs  with  other  low-skilled  workers  in  Canada,  the   literature  review  anticipates  that  NPRs  would  likely  have  lower  wages  than  other  low- skilled  CB,  and  low-skilled  IMM  and  that  low-skilled  workers  in  general  concentrate  

104  

     

around  low  wages.  From  this  perspective,  question  one  will  require  elaborating  a  profile   of  low-skilled  labour  in  Canada;  question  two  will  require  exploring  the  wage  ranges  of   the  occupations  analyzed  through  a  quartile  analysis;  questions  three  to  six  are   explored  by  investigating  the  following  hypotheses:   Among  low-skilled  workers  in  Canada,   Hypothesis  1:  All  NPRs  earn  lower  wages  than  CB  and  IMM  when  NPR  wages   are  compared  to  those  of  the  CB  and  IMM  by   a.  Sub-Hypothesis  1a:  industry  sector  and  occupation   b.  Sub-Hypothesis  1b:  sex,  province  of  residence,  work  location   (rural/urban),  level  of  education,  ability  to  speak  English  or  French  and   place  of  birth  all  in  each  occupation  analyzed  in  this  study   Hypothesis  2:  Controlling  for  age,  sex,  immigration  status,  province  of   residence,  work  location  (rural/urban),  level  of  education,  ability  to  speak  English  or   French  and  place  of  birth,  being  a  NPR  has  a  significant  negative  impact  on  wage   compared  to  being  Canadian-born.   Hypothesis  3:  These  previous  statements  are  the  consequences  of  policies  in   place  that  prevent  NPRs  from  accessing  citizenship.   To  determine  the  number  and  distribution  of  low-skilled  workers,  this  research  will   present  a  profile  of  low-skilled  labour  (including  information  of  low-skilled  NPRs)  in   Canada  in  chapter  five.  To  evaluate  the  wage  differences  between  low-skilled  workers   according  to  citizenship  status,  this  study  will  compare  the  wages  of  low-skilled  workers   without  citizenship  (NPRs)  with  the  wages  of  low-skilled  Canadian  born  and  low-skilled   immigrants  (who  are  either  citizens  or  permanent  residents).  The  study  will  further  

105  

     

nuance  these  differences  by  evaluating  wage  differentials  not  only  by  citizenship  status   but  also  by  intrinsic  characteristics.  
  

4.2.  Methods  used  to  test  the  hypotheses  and  address  the  questions.   Addressing  these  questions  and  their  respective  hypotheses  requires  a  quantitative   analysis  following  two  main  methods:  cross  tabulation  and  regression  analysis.      4.2.1.  Cross  Tabulation.  Also  known  as  contingency  analysis,  cross  tabulation   consists  of  tabulating  two  or  more  variables  to  establish  the  degree  of  interrelatedness   between  or  among  them.  This  contrast  takes  place  by  comparing  the  values  of  a   variable,  for  example  by  comparing  the  average  wage  of  population  A  against  the   average  wage  of  population  B.  In  contrast  with  regression  analysis,  it  does  not  treat   variables  as  dependent  or  independent.  However,  in  this  dissertation,  I  will  use  cross   tabulation  to  analyze  how  changes  in  the  independent  variable45  (wages)  are  related  to   changes  in  the  dependent  variables  (sex,  country  of  birth,  etc.).  I  will  also  use  cross   tabulation  to  explore  correlations  between  intrinsic  characteristics  of  the  workers  and   their  occupations  with  wages.   The  outcomes  of  cross  tabulation  analysis  provide  information  on  the  relation   between  variables  (for  example,  the  relation  between  wage  and  sex  in  each  occupation   or  the  average  wage  by  sex  in  each  occupation).  A  limitation  of  this  method  is  that  it   does  not  permit  us  to  simultaneously  consider  multiple  effects  that  independent  
                                                                                                 
45

  As  the  name  indicates,  an  independent  variable  has  no  dependency  on  other  variables  (ex.  sex).  In   contrast,  dependent  variables  build  their  outcomes  in  a  relation  of  dependency  on  other  variables  (ex.   wages).     

106  

     

variables  may  have  on  a  dependent  variable.  For  example,  higher  wages  among  those   working  in  urban  settings  does  not  necessarily  mean  that  working  in  an  urban  area  is   the  only  causal  factor  influencing  high  wages.  Other  characteristics  may  also  affect   wages.  While  simultaneous  analysis  accordingly  provides  a  more  accurate  picture  of  the   effects  of  multiple  variables,  a  single  variable  trend  analysis  is  nevertheless  valuable   insofar  as  it  can  deliver  a  basic  picture  that  is  easy  to  interpret.  In  other  words,  a  cross   tabulation  approach  provides  an  accessible  tool  for  gauging  intervariable  relations,  a   considerable  asset  when  it  comes  to  policymaking.  I  accordingly  use  this  method  in  my   analysis  and  compensate  for  its  limitations  by  also  engaging  in  a  regression  analysis  of   the  data.      4.2.2.  Regression  analysis.  Regression  analysis  is  a  mathematical  method  that   establishes  complex  relationships  between  variables.  More  specifically,  it  allows  us  to   simultaneously  explore  the  effects  of  a  set  of  multiple  independent  variables  on  a   specific  dependent  variable.    =      +      +   +. . . +      
  

Where:   =  observed  values  of  the  dependent  variable     =  constant  (captures  any  bias  due  to  unaccounted  effects)    ,  , . . .    =  coefficients  (capture  the  effects  of  the  independent  variable  on  the   dependent  variable)    ,  . . .    =  observed  values  of  the  independent  variables  

107  

     

In  a  mathematical  model,  the  observed  values  of  the  independent  variables   ( ,  . . .  )  are  mathematically  transformed  to  establish  their  impact  on  the  dependent   variable.  In  this  research,  the  independent  variables  are  the  intrinsic  characteristics  of   workers  (age,  sex,  etc.)  and  their  occupations  (province  of  residence,  etc.).  The   dependent  variable  is  hourly  wage.    

   The  effects  are  captured  through  the  constant  `a'  and  the  coefficients.  This  research   uses  Linear  Multiple  Regression  with  categorical  variables,  a  model  based  on  the   method  known  as  Ordinary  Least  Squares  (OLS).    For  further  details  on  this  method   see  appendix  one.   This  methodology  requires  the  transformation  of  all  categories  of  the  independent   variables  into  dummies.46  The  number  of  categories  transformed  into  dummies  minus   one  is  accordingly  introduced  in  each  of  the  models  developed.  Linear  multiple   regression  with  categorical  variables  also  needs  the  dependent  variables  to  be  normally  

                                                                                                 
46

  Transforming  into  dummy  variables  implies  recoding  each  category  in  a  categorical  variable  into  either   zeros  (0s)  or  ones  (1s).  For  example,  in  a  "Yes/No"  variable,  all  `Yes'  entries  become  `1'  and  all  `No'   entries  become  `0.'  In  variables  with  multiple  categories,  each  category  is  treated  as  a  Yes/No  variable.    

108  

     

distributed.47  Finally,  it  requires  that  there  is  no  co-linearity  between  subcategories  in  a   variable  or  between  variables  (Stockburger,  1998).  This  is  very  important;  otherwise  it  is   impossible  to  distinguish  where  an  effect  is  coming  from.      4.3.  Selection  of  Dataset  (2006  census)        After  evaluating  the  available  datasets,  including  the  Survey  of  Labour  and  

Income  Dynamics  (SLID)  and  Labour  Force  Survey  (LFS),  I  found  the  census  data  to  be   the  most  comprehensive.  Census  data  is  preferred  because  it  contains  information  of  all   groups  to  be  compared  in  my  analysis,  including  temporary  foreign  workers.  To  evaluate   the  outcomes  in  the  labour  market  of  the  three  groups  of  low-skilled  workers,  I  preferred   2006  census  data,  which  was  the  most  recent  census  available  when  I  began  my   research  and  the  dataset  with  the  largest  sample  of  low-skilled  temporary  foreign   workers.  This  database  includes  information  related  not  only  to  the  labour  market  but   also  to  different  characteristics  of  workers.  It  is  worth  mentioning  that  the  census  data  is   collected  on  one  day  of  the  year,  which  means  that  some  temporary  low-skilled  workers   may  be  under-represented.   While  this  research  intends  to  participate  in  the  academic  debate  concerning  the   dramatic  increase  in  low-skilled  TFWs  and  its  effect  on  wages,  the  most  recent  available   data  dates  to  the  years  in  which  this  growth  was  in  its  infancy.  That  is,  at  the  time  that  I   began  my  research,  the  2006  census  was  still  the  most  comprehensive  dataset   available.  Even  if  it  had  been  available,  the  2011  National  Household  Survey  (NHS)   data  would  not  have  been  a  reliable  data  source  for  the  type  of  patterns  examined  in  
                                                                                                 
47

  In  statistical  analysis,  a  normal  distribution  concentrates  most  of  the  values  around  the  mean.  Thus,  a   normal  distribution  contains  about  68%  of  the  observation  within  one  standard  deviation  (Encyclopedia  of   Mathematics,  2015).

this  dissertation.  The  2011  NHS  had  a  response  rate  lower  than  that  of  the  2006  Census   (77%  and  94%,  respectively)  (Verret,  2013),  which  would  have  been  problematic  for  this   study.  Although  the  occupation  level  information  has  been  deemed  reliable  (Statistics   Canada  has  provided  the  public  information  at  the  occupation  level),48  data  by   occupation  at  deeper  levels  of  analysis  (sex,  level  of  education,  etc.)  would  have   included  significantly  fewer  counts.  This  is  even  more  critical  for  analyses  of  the  NPR   population,  which  is  already  very  small.  In  short,  the  2011  NHS  would  have  provided   smaller  sample  sizes  than  the  2006  Census,  which  in  turn  would  have  altered  the   reliability  of  the  present  study.  Furthermore,  although  the  2006  Census  may  seem   dated,  in  some  ways  it  provides  an  ideal  dataset  because  it  acts  as  the  take  off  point  of   the  growth  of  low-skilled  labour  in  Canada.49   To  evaluate  trends  in  temporary  foreign  workers  and  how  their  wages  compare   with  other  immigrant  or  Canadian  workers,  it  would  be  necessary  to  consider   information  from  subsequent  years.  Since  the  amount  of  detail  required  for  this  kind  of   comparative  analysis  is  obtained  only  through  the  Canadian  census,  which  is  conducted   every  five  years,  we  will  have  to  wait  until  more  information  becomes  available.  Ideally,   future  research  will  compare  the  results  from  the  present  study  with  a  similar  analysis  of   other  censuses  (i.e.  the  2016  Census),  which  will  allow  us  to  evaluate  changes  over   time.   Originally,  I  wanted  to  use  the  2006  Public  Use  Microdata  File  (PUMF)  files,   which  is  a  small  sample  of  the  2006  Census.  I  identified  this  as  a  potential  dataset  to   develop  this  study;  however,  the  PUMF  was  not  used  because  its  sample  size  was

  The  2011  National  Household  Survey  Tables  include  information  on  employment  income  at  the   occupation  level  (Statistics  Canada,  2017a).   49   This  will  be  explained  in  more  detail  in  the  following  chapter.

inadequate  (too  small).  Exploring  this  dataset  was  nevertheless  useful  because  it   provided  an  overview  of  the  proportions  and  numbers  within  a  larger  dataset:  the  whole   2006  census  data.  The  census  comprises  approximately  20%  of  the  entire  Canadian   population  or  more  than  6  million  cases  (Canada's  population  in  2006  was  about  32.6   million).  In  contrast,  the  Public  Use  Microdata  File  (PUMF)  contains  only  844  476   records,  representing  2.7%  of  the  Canadian  population.  Having  such  a  small  proportion   of  the  total  population  makes  it  difficult  to  extract  meaningful  information  about  the  NPR   population.  This  is  even  more  problematic  in  the  present  study,  which  explores   outcomes  at  a  very  granular  level  (i.e.  at  the  level  of  occupation).   These  records  were  drawn  from  a  sample  of  one  fifth  of  the  Canadian  population,   a  sample  data  from  questionnaire  2B  (from  the  whole  census).  The  2006  PUMF   includes  123  variables.  Of  these,  102  variables,  or  83%,  come  from  the  individual   universe  and  21  variables,  or  17%,  are  drawn  from  the  family,  household  and  dwelling   universes.  For  details  on  the  distribution  in  the  unweighted  PUMF  files,  as  well  as  the   procedure  used  to  evaluate  why  the  PUMF  files  were  not  sufficient  for  this  analysis,  see   appendix  3A.   Given  that  the  PUMF  was  inadequate,  I  had  to  focus  my  attention  on  the  entire   2006  census  database.  To  access  this  dataset,  a  proposal  was  presented  to  the   Statistics  Canada  and  the  Social  Sciences  and  Humanities  Research  Council  (SSHRC)   (see  appendix  two).  As  with  PUMF  files,  the  2006  census  database  was  explored  using   the  SPSS  statistical  analysis  software.  The  use  of  this  dataset  (among  the  largest  and   most  complex  datasets  in  Canada)  represented  a  massive  research  undertaking.

4.4.  Variables  Used  in  the  Analysis  (Justification)  and  Data  Extraction   The  same  variables  selected  for  the  PUMF  files  were  also  used  for  the  whole   dataset.  It  is  important  to  keep  in  mind  that  some  variables  were  used  to  analyze  the   outcomes  and  other  variables  were  used  to  select  the  population  to  be  analyzed.  This   section  focuses  on  the  former  and  the  next  section  on  the  latter.      Using  the  methods  previously  described  to  evaluate  the  hypotheses,  this  

research  draws  on  a  set  of  independent  variables,  including  immigration  status,  age,   sex,  etc.,  which  will  then  be  contrasted  against  wages.  Detailed  definitions  of  the   variables  as  per  the  2006  Census  Codebook  are  found  in  appendix  3B.  Justifications  for   why  each  of  these  variables  is  used  in  this  study  as  well  as  the  decisions  made  for  each   independent  variable  will  be  addressed  in  this  section.  The  following  are  the  dependent   and  independent  variables  used  in  the  analysis.   Dependent  variable:   ·   Hourly  Wages   Independent  variables   ·   Occupation   ·   Industry  Sectors   ·   Immigrant  Status  (CB,  IMM,  and  NPR)   ·   Province  of  Residence   ·   Age   ·   Sex   112  
     

·   Rural/Urban  setting   ·   Level  of  Education   ·   First  Official  Language  spoken   ·   Country  of  birth/Region  of  Birth      4.4.1.  Depended  variable  -  Why  are  wages  relevant?  Wage  is  generally  the  

main  source  of  income  for  workers  and  is  an  indirect  indicator  of  economic  growth.   When  viewed  in  relation  to  prices,  wages  provide  information  on  the  purchase  power  of   individuals  and,  by  extension,  their  level  of  poverty.  In  association  with  variables,   including  employment,  working  hours  and  type  of  work,  wages  also  provide  a  window   into  the  general  conditions  of  a  labour  market.  The  level  of  wages  provides  information   about  the  economic  strength  of  a  specific  industry  sector  and  the  situation  of  scarcity  or   abundance  of  labour  in  the  regions  of  employment.  Wages  may  also  be  a  means  to   gauge  the  level  of  fairness  vis-a-vis  labour  conditions  within  specific  industry  sectors.   According  to  the  International  Labour  Organization  (ILO),   Wages  are  undoubtedly  among  the  most  important  conditions  of  work  and   employment  at  the  enterprise  level.  Being  a  cost  for  employers  as  well  as  the   main  source  of  income  for  workers,  wages  may  be  a  potential  source  of  conflict   and  have  thus  become  the  major  focus  of  collective  bargaining  all  over  the  world.   At  the  same  time,  wages  can  represent  a  major  source  of  discrimination  and   deprivation  if  no  decent  floor  is  guaranteed  to  the  workers.  On  the  economic  side,   wages  represent  an  important  part  of  labour  costs  and  are  an  essential  variable   for  enterprises'  competitiveness  which  needs  to  be  analysed,  also  with  regard  to   their  interaction  with  other  key  economic  variables,  such  as  employment,   productivity  and  investment.  All  the  above  factors  have  led  States,  together  with   employers'  and  workers'  representatives,  to  reconsider  their  wages  policies  and   undertake  crucial  reforms  in  this  field  or  to  consider  new  approaches  for  which   the  help  of  the  ILO  has  been  required  (2009).        113  
     

As  this  passage  indicates,  wages  deserve  special  attention  for  various  reasons  of   social,  political  and  economic  importance.  Wages  are  often  the  battleground  for  social   conflicts  between  the  forces  that  control  the  means  of  production  and  those  who   actually  produce.  They  are  a  constant  point  of  tension  between  the  promotion  of   economic  growth  and  the  quest  for  humane  living  conditions.  While  social  organizations   have  accomplished  certain  historical  gains,  such  as  setting  a  minimum  wage,  in  the   current  context  of  neoliberalism,  many  instruments  are  set  in  place  to  drive  wages   down.   After  exploring  the  implications  of  analyzing  weekly  wages  and  hourly  wages,  I   chose  Hourly  Wages50  as  a  variable  because  it  allows  direct  comparisons  with  external   data,  which  primarily  use  hourly  wages,  and  because  it  is  the  most  fundamental   remuneration  marker.  The  variable  'Weekly  Wages'  is  the  base  for  developing  the   variable  'Hourly  Wages.'  'Wages'  corresponds  to  "the  gross  wages  and  salaries  before   deductions  such  as  includes  income  tax,  pensions,  employment  insurance,  etc.,"   (Statistics  Canada,  2008,  p.997),  earned  in  2005  and  'Weeks'  refers  to  the  number  of   weeks  worked  in  2005.     Hourly  wages  are  calculated  in  two  steps.  First,  weekly  wages  are  obtained  by   dividing  the  variable  'Wages,'  which  is  annual,  by  the  variable  'Weeks,'  which  gathers   information  on  the  number  of  weeks  worked  during  the  year  (2005)  (for  detailed   definitions,  see  appendix  3B).  This  calculation  yields  'Weekly  Wages,'  which  is  then   divided  by  the  variable  'Hours,'  which  gathers  information  on  the  number  of  hours   worked  during  the  week  prior  to  the  census  (for  a  detailed  definition,  see  appendix  3B).   This  calculation  of  hourly  wages  has  some  limitations  since  it  assumes  that  the

  It  considered  only  for  those  workers  who  reported  employment  income  from  low-skilled  occupations.

average  number  of  hours  worked  during  the  week  for  all  cases  is  equivalent  to  the   number  of  hours  worked  during  the  week  prior  to  the  census.  However,  this  is  the  only   way  to  calculate  hourly  wage  using  census  data.  As  explained  earlier  in  this  chapter,  the   census  was  chosen  because  it  is  the  only  database  that  includes  significant  information   on  NPRs,  which  is  the  main  population  to  be  analyzed  in  this  dissertation.  In  order  to   have  the  most  accurate  calculation  possible,  the  selected  population  includes  only  those   reported  in  the  census  as  working  "full-time"  (working  30  hours  or  more  per  week).  This   ensures  that  all  included  cases  worked  the  minimum  number  of  hours  considered  by   Statistics  Canada  as  'full-time.'  This  is  the  best  possible  way  to  calculate  hourly  wage   rates  with  the  available  data  and  corresponds  with  how  other  research  studies  have   analyzed  wages  based  on  census  data  (Fortin  &  Huberman,  2002;  Pellerin,  2015).  
  

4.4.2.  Independent  variables  (justification  and  selection  of  categories   criteria).  The  following  independent  variables  were  included  in  the  analysis:  
  

4.4.2.1.  Immigration  status.  This  variable  is  arguably  the  most  important   independent  variable  since  it  separates  the  population  according  to  their  legal  status,   which  is  central  to  this  study.  This  variable  captures  whether  low-skilled  workers  either   have  or  do  not  have  access  to  citizenship.  Therefore,  the  quantitative  research  in  this   study  is  anchored  in  three  different  status  circumstances:  NPR,  CB  and  IMM.  As   previously  explained,  the  immigrant  category  includes  both  naturalized  citizens  and   permanent  residents  since  both  have  the  same  access  to  citizenship  and  labour  market   rights.  The  criteria  to  select  who  is  considered  NPR  are  included  in  the  next  section  on   the  selection  of  populations.   115  
     

4.4.2.2.  Industry  sectors.51  This  variable  groups  individuals  according  to  the   economic  sector  to  which  their  occupations  belong.  It  is  relevant  to  the  analysis   because  an  industry  sector-level  analysis  offers  insight  into  the  general  labour  market   outcomes  at  the  sectoral  level,  which  is  also  central  for  policy  analysis.  For  the  industry   sector-level  analysis,  the  three  kinds  of  low-skilled  populations  (IMM,  CB  and  NPR)   correspond  to  the  populations  also  selected  at  the  occupation-level  analysis  (see  the   next  section).   Given  that  occupations  are  grouped  into  industry  sectors,  the  number  of  people  by   industry  sector  in  each  of  the  populations  (NPR,  IMM  and  CB)  comes  from  selecting   only  those  working  in  the  98  occupations  designated  as  low-skilled  and  that  fall  into   each  industry  sector.  The  main  criterion  for  selecting  low-skilled  workers  was   occupation,  not  sector.  The  selection  of  low-skilled  workers  by  sector  is  done  via   occupations  because  skill-level  is  more  closely  related  to  the  occupation  than  to  the   industry  sector.  While  occupations  are  either  low-  or  high-skilled,  industry  sectors   include  both  low-  and  high-skilled  occupations.  Although  the  industry  sector  analysis   provides  a  good  first  approach  to  wage  differences,  it  is  not  granular  enough,  which   makes  the  analysis  at  the  occupation  level  necessary.  This  will  be  explained  in  more   detailed  in  the  next  chapters.   4.4.2.3.  Occupation.  Like  immigration  status,  occupation  is  another  important   pillar  of  this  research.  Analysis  at  the  occupation  level  is  necessary  because  this  is  the   level  at  which  federal  and  provincial  levels  of  government  prepare  labour  market

  This  variable  followed  the  classification  followed  by  ESDC  and  recreated  in  the  census.  The  variable   considers  21  industry  sectors.  Of  the  21  industry  sectors  classified  by  Statistics  Canada,  only  the  13  with   a  reliable  number  of  counts  and  that  passed  the  Bonferroni  test  were  included  (these  criteria  will  be  later   explained  in  this  chapter).

projections.  From  the  perspective  of  citizenship,  occupation  specific  analyses  provide  a   more  accurate  view  of  the  relation  between  the  labour  market  and  legal  status.   Occupations  provide  a  means  to  establish  a  more  granular  analysis  of  industry  sectors.   Having  information  of  outcomes  at  the  level  of  occupations  nuances  and  differentiates   the  relations  of  other  independent  variables  (intrinsic  characteristics)  on  the  dependent   variable  (wages).   The  variable  'occupation'  specifies  the  labour  activities  undertaken  by  low-skilled   workers.  Recall  from  chapter  two  that  the  concept  of  low-skilled  occupation  stems  from   the  classification  of  occupations  based  on  skill  levels  included  in  the  NOC  system  of   classification  of  occupations.  This  system  considers  five  skill  levels  (0,  A,  B,  C  and  D).   The  first  three  (0,  A  and  B)  are  high-skilled  (requiring  education  above  high  school)  and   the  last  two  (C  and  D)  are  low-skilled  (requiring  specific  short  training  after  high  school   (C)  or  high  school  or  below  (D)).  In  addition  to  skill  level,  the  NOC  system  of   classification  also  groups  occupations  according  to  skill  type,  occupational  mobility  and   industry.  What  I  refer  in  this  analysis  as  "occupations"  corresponds  to  what  the  NOC   system  calls  NOC  4  occupations52.  Appendix  3C  presents  specific  details  of  how   occupations  are  classified  in  the  NOC  system.  By  the  same  token,  section  4.5.3.  in  this   chapter  details  the  selection  process  of  the  occupations  included  in  this  analysis.     The  NOC  system  is  the  outcome  of  significant  research  and  consultation,   especially  on  determining  "the  knowledge  and  skill  requirements,  paths  of  progression   and  occupational  mobility"  (Roberts,  2003,  p.7)  related  to  each  job.  While  these  
                                                                                                 
52

  Additional  to  skill  levels,  the  NOC  data  is  also  configured  and  presented  in  digits,  which  refer  to  the   system  to  code  the  grouped  occupations.  NOC  4  refers  to  the  occupations  grouped  at  the  four-digit  level.   This  level  groups  types  of  jobs.  NOC  4  occupation  is  the  most  granular  level  of  classifications  of   occupations.  For  further  details,  see  appendix  3C.

principles  are  evident  for  high-skilled  occupations,  in  low-skilled  occupations  they  are   not  as  clear.  Although  the  system  is  defined  by  the  levels  of  education  required  to   perform  a  job,  in  low-skilled  occupations  the  connection  between  skills  and  education  is   often  very  weak.  The  system  is  based  on  formal  educational  requirements,  which  are   not  reflective  of  the  skills  needed  to  perform  many  low-skilled  jobs,  which  require  levels   of  education  below  high  school.   The  academic  literature  related  to  skills  in  the  labour  market  points  to  their   degradation.  Form  (1987),  for  example,  shows  that  early  studies  on  the  industrial   revolution  showed  not  only  the  disappearance  of  many  crafts,  but  also  the  overall   decline  of  skills  (Form,  1987).  Drawing  on  later,  more  complex,  studies,  he  concludes   that  industrialization  "may  have  created  as  many  new  skills  as  it  destroyed"  (Form,   1987,  p.29).  Braverman's  work  (1974),  which  focuses  on  the  structure  of  and  changes   in  the  American  working  class,  also  reinforces  this  trend  by  detailing  the  deskilling  of   clerical  jobs  (Steinberg,  1990).  Literature  that  focuses  on  skills  (linked  to  education)  in   relation  to  wages  highlights  the  detachment  of  skills  from  the  actual  tasks  of  a  job:   "Among  those  engaged  in  the  debate  over  human  capital  versus  structural  determinants   of  wages,  skill  has  come  to  be  measured  as  the  level  of  education  and  experience  that   an  individual  brings  to  a  job  rather  than  as  a  characteristic  of  a  job  requirement"  (Mincer   &  Polachek,  1974  as  cited  in  Steinberg,  1990,  p.450).  This  observation  reinforces  the   work  of  others,  which  reveals  the  socially-constructed  nature  of  skills  (Steiger,  1993).     A  system  structured  on  occupational  categories  that  are,  in  turn,  based  on  skills   linked  only  to  education  seems  to  be  reductive  (Esposto,  2008)  and  to  reinforce  the   effects  of  class  organization  (Braverman,  1974,  as  cited  in  Jonna  &  Foster,  2014).  

118  

     

Another  consequence  of  the  "social  definition  and  evaluation  of  skills"  is  the   invisibilization  of  women's  skills  (Steinberg,  1990,  p.  475).  This  system  also  provides  a   means  of  stratifying  people  according  to  citizenship  status.  It  marginalizes  many  low- skilled  workers  who  perform  activities  that  are  essential  for  human  life  (ex.  agriculture   and  childrearing)  but  that  not  everybody  is  willing  (or  capable)  of  doing.     Designating  low-skilled  occupations  as  those  that  require  either  high  school  or   other  specific  training  (skill  level  C)  or  on-the-job  training  (skill  level  D),  is  a  rather   imprecise  way  of  defining  a  set  of  jobs  that  require  skills  acquired  neither  in  high  school   nor  through  on-the-job  training.  For  example,  agricultural  labour  is  highly  physically   demanding  and  requires  many  years  of  work  in  agriculture-related  occupations  to  be   able  to  endure  long  hours  working  in  very  uncomfortable  positions.  When  recruiters  look   for  foreign  agricultural  workers,  they  often  look  for  people  with  significant  experience   working  in  agriculture  in  their  countries  of  origin  (Basok,  2002).  The  NOC  system  does   not  account  for  that  type  of  experience,  even  if  it  is  required  to  perform  the  job;  it  only   accounts  for  skills  acquired  via  formal  education.  Truck  driving  provides  another   example  of  this  tendency,  as  it  requires  specific  skills  that  do  not  register  under  the   requirements  of  the  skill  level  C  (education  below  high  school).  This  will  be  explained  in   more  detail  in  chapter  nine.   4.4.2.4.  Province  of  residence.  Consideration  of  a  worker's  province  of   residence  is  important  because  it  provides  a  more  regional/localized  analysis  of  low- skilled  labour.  That  said,  it  is  important  to  disaggregate  data  at  the  provincial  level   because  the  economies  vary  from  province  to  province.  Given  that  some  provinces  offer   pathways  to  citizenship  for  low-skilled  workers  (Palacio,  2010),  a  provincial  analysis  is  

119  

     

highly  desirable.  Furthermore,  labour  regulations  change  from  province  to  province,   which  may  influence  wages.  Due  to  sample  size,  in  this  analysis,  a  provincial  analysis  is   only  done  to  the  point  of  evaluating  wages  by  occupation,  without  introducing  other   independent  variables.  To  analyze  wages  some  rearrangements  are  required  to  adjust   for  the  sample  size:   4.4.2.4.1.  The  Atlantic  Provinces.  Prince  Edward  Island,  Newfoundland,  Nova   Scotia  and  New  Brunswick  were  grouped  together  due  to  small  sample  sizes  of  NPRs   at  the  provincial  level  in  both  occupations  and  industry  sectors.  Even  after  being   grouped  together,  the  number  of  NPRs  by  occupation  was  still  extremely  small,  which   required  the  analysis  to  be  restricted  to  the  total  for  the  entire  region.  However,  by   including  the  group  in  the  regression  analysis  it  was  possible  to  overcome  these   restrictions  and  obtain  information  on  outcomes  of  low-skilled  workers  in  the  main   occupations  for  the  region.   4.4.2.4.2.  Manitoba  and  Saskatchewan.  Manitoba  and  Saskatchewan  were  also   grouped  together  because  of  the  small  number  of  NPRs  at  the  levels  of  occupation  and   industry  sector.  Sample  size  and  privacy  restrictions  allowed  the  analysis  of  only  a  few   occupations.  These  provinces  were  included  in  the  regression  analysis,  which  yielded  a   more  accurate  picture  when  the  outcomes  were  statistically  significant.   4.4.2.4.3.  Territories.  Once  again  due  to  sample  size  and  privacy  restrictions,  the   territories  were  left  out  of  the  descriptive  analysis  but  were  included  in  the  regression   analysis  as  a  single  group.   4.4.2.4.4.  Other  Provinces.  Quebec,  Ontario,  Alberta  and  British  Columbia  were   all  analyzed  individually.  

120  

     

   4.4.2.5.  Age.  Age  is  relevant  to  this  study  because  it  is  often  overlooked  as  a   factor  affecting  the  wages  and  legal  integration  of  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  workers   in  Canada.  The  variable  'age'  will  be  used  linearly.  Regression  analysis  allows  us  to   evaluate  the  effects  of  age  on  wages  for  the  entire  population.  It  also  permits  a  linear   view  of  the  effects  of  age  in  combination  with  the  other  variables  used  in  this  study,   which  is  a  more  effective  way  of  gauging  whether  wage  has  any  effect  on  labour  market   outcomes.  This  will  be  explained  in  more  detail  in  the  chapter  on  regression  analysis   (chapter  eight).  No  cross-tabulation  analysis  was  done  because  sample  sizes  did  not   allow  grouping  the  variable  for  an  occupation  level  analysis.  As  will  be  explained  in  the   limitations  section  (section  4.6.),  a  prime  age  (25-54  years  of  age)  analysis  was   intended  but  not  pursued  because  sample  sizes  did  not  allow  it.   4.4.2.6.  Level  of  Education.  Information  on  education  levels  among  low-skilled   workers  allows  us  to  analyze  the  influence  (if  any)  of  education  on  wages.  Difficulty   having  their  foreign  credentials  recognized,  demands  for  Canadian  work  experience  and   a  lack  of  social  capital  lead  many  highly  educated  immigrants  to  take  low-skilled  jobs   (Bauder,  2003;  Galarneau  &  Morissette,  2008;  Reitz,  2005).  While  this  research  does   not  intend  to  analyze  the  experiences  of  highly  educated  immigrants  working  in  low- skilled  jobs,  it  does  provide  a  way  to  determine  the  proportion  of  highly-educated  NPRs   working  in  low-skilled  occupations  as  well  as  the  type  of  occupations  in  which  they  tend   to  work.  The  categories  of  this  variable  (see  appendix  3B)  reflect  Statistics  Canada's   classification  of  the  labour  force  according  to  level  of  education.   4.4.2.7.  Place  of  birth.

workers?  Do  low-skilled  workers  from  certain  countries  tend  to  group  around  certain   occupations?     Knowing  the  extent  to  which  workers'  country  or  region  of  birth  affects  their   wages  sheds  insight  into  specific  wage-related  experiences  of  immigrants  in  relation  to   their  identity.  It  also  contextualizes  the  outcomes  of  low-skilled  Canadian-born  vis-a-vis   immigrant  and  migrant  (NPR)  workers  according  to  their  region  of  origin,  which,  on  a   global  scale,  have  varying  degrees  of  economic  strength.  In  the  2006  census,  the   variable  'Place  of  Birth'  refers  to  the  place  in  which  the  respondent  was  born  and  has   241  categories  (countries/places  of  birth).  In  the  cross-tabulation  analysis,  only   countries  with  a  significant  number  of  NPRs  were  included  in  the  analysis  (more  than  90   ­  for  details  see  section  4.5.3.  in  this  chapter).  In  the  regression  analysis,  this  variable  is   transformed  into  the  variable  'Regions  of  the  World,'  which  groups  countries  together  by   regions  (see  appendix  3B).   4.4.2.8.  Sex.53  Sex  analysis  in  this  research  explores  the  impact  that  sex  type   has  on  the  outcomes  in  the  labour  market  cross-checked  with  immigration  status.   Existing  literature  documents  wage  differences  between  men  and  women  and  among   women  in  the  labour  market.  The  male/female  wage  gap  in  Canada  is  about  20%,  which   is  comparable  to  the  United  States  and  the  United  Kingdom,  but  larger  than  it  is  in  most   European  OECD  countries  (below  10  %)  (Kahn,  2015).  The  gender  wage  gap  is  also   larger  in  Canada  than  in  Australia.  This  is  likely  a  function  of  Australia's  compressed   wage  structure,  which  is  heavily  influenced  by  the  relatively  strong  presence  of

  This  variable  helps  consider  the  differences  in  labour  market  outcomes  by  occupation  between  males   and  females.  The  variable  name  "Sex"  and  the  categories  "Male"  and  "Female"  are  used  in  this  analysis   because  those  are  the  words  given  by  Statistics  Canada.  Using  other  words  would  misrepresent  Statistics   Canada's  outcomes.

expanded  collective  bargaining  structures  in  Australia  (Kahn,  2015).  Wage  gaps  related   to  immigration  status  among  low-skilled  females  are  also  brought  to  light  by  the   literature.  The  present  research  provides  quantitative  evidence  of  these  differences  by   occupation.  Again,  nuancing  outcomes  is  important,  since  it  allows  us  to  address  such   differences  in  a  more  efficient  way.   The  chapter  on  wage  analysis  by  intrinsic  characteristics  (of  NPRs  themselves   and  their  occupations)54,  includes  analysis  on  differences  in  wages  among  people  of  the   same  sex  by  occupation  and  further  nuanced  by  immigration  status.  The  regression   analysis  addresses  wage  discrepancies  between  low-skilled  males  and  low-skilled   females.   4.4.2.9.  Rural~Urban.  Exploring  differences  in  labour  market  outcomes   according  to  occupation  in  both  rural  and  urban  settings  provides  a  window  into   rural/urban  economic  differences.  Some  occupations,  such  as  occupations  in   agriculture,  are  predominantly  (if  not  completely)  rural,  while  others,  such  as   occupations  in  caregiving,  are  predominantly  urban.  In  this  thesis,  introducing  this   variable  provides  a  more  nuanced  outcome  for  workers  in  agricultural  occupations.   4.4.2.10.  First  official  language  spoken.  The  ability  to  speak  an  official   Canadian  language  is  another  central  variable  in  labour  market  analysis.  Most  research   and  policies  designed  to  integrate  immigrants  into  the  labour  market  identify  the  inability   to  communicate  in  either  official  language  as  the  major  barrier  to  labour  market   integration.  But  If  immigration  status  is  accounted  for,  do  the  wages  of  low-skilled   workers  who  report  speaking  either  English  or  French  differ?     The  census  evaluates  one's  ability  to  communicate  in  either  English  or  French

with  the  following  question:  "Can  this  person  speak  English  or  French  well  enough  to   conduct  a  conversation?"  (Census  Questionnaire  and  Guides,  2006).  In  this   dissertation,  analysis  of  this  variable  will  focus  only  on  differences  between  NPRs  and   IMM  in  order  to  evaluate  whether  speaking  an  official  language  actually  makes  a   difference  after  acquiring  citizenship.  A  comparison  with  Canadian-born  workers  is   omitted  because  they  are  expected  to  speak  one  of  the  official  languages.  
  

4.5.  Selection  of  Population:  Criteria  and  Considerations  Prior  to  Data  Extraction   The  same  criteria  used  for  the  PUMF  files  were  also  used  for  the  whole  census   data  set.  Individuals  were  selected  for  working  in  low-skilled  occupations  with  one  of  the   following  legal  statuses:  Canadian-born,  immigrant  (including  naturalized  immigrants   and  permanent  residents)  and  Non-Permanent  Resident  (including  refugees  and   temporary  foreign  workers).  All  were  reported  to  be  15  years  of  age  or  older,  employed   in  a  paid  job  (i.e.  not  self-employed),  working  full-time,  and  not  undertaking  formal   studies.  The  following  eight  criteria  defined  the  population:  
  

4.5.1.  Selection  of  low-skilled  NPRs  in  the  2006  census.     The  base  population  in  the  2006  Census  includes  the  NPR  population,  which  is   defined  as:   persons  who  are  lawfully  in  Canada  on  a  temporary  basis  under  the  authority  of  a   temporary  resident  permit,  along  with  members  of  their  family  living  with  them.   NPRs  include  foreign  workers,  foreign  students,  the  humanitarian  population  and   other  temporary  residents.  The  humanitarian  population  includes  refugee   claimants  and  temporary  residents  who  are  allowed  to  remain  in  Canada  on   humanitarian  grounds  and  are  not  categorized  as  either  foreign  workers  or   foreign  students  (Stats  Canada,  2015).          124  
     

More  than  112  000  NPRs  (high-  and  low-skilled)  are  reported  in  the  2006  long  form  of   the  census  (Thomas,  2010).  For  the  purpose  of  this  study,  I  removed  all  high-skilled  and   selected  only  low-skilled  cases.  Foreign  students  were  also  removed  (the  database   allows  their  removal).  Therefore,  this  study  includes  only  low-skilled  TFWs,  low-skilled   refugee  claimants  and  low-skilled  people  with  a  temporary  resident  visa  on   humanitarian  grounds.   The  exclusion  of  foreign  students  is  linked  to  the  type  of  jobs  they  usually  have.   In  contrast  to  TFWs  or  refugee  claimants  or  people  with  a  temporary  resident  visa  on   humanitarian  grounds,  foreign  students  who  work  in  low-skilled  occupations  are  likely  to   do  so  in  a  part-time  capacity  and  for  only  a  very  short  period  of  time.  Low-skilled  TFWs   work  in  full-time  jobs  and  remain  in  them  for  longer  periods  of  time.  Furthermore,  foreign   students  who  decide  to  remain  in  Canada  and  become  permanent  residents  usually  find   work  in  high-skilled  occupations.  For  these  reasons,  foreign  students  are  left  out  of  the   analysis  and  consideration  of  the  low-skilled  NPR  population  is  confined  to  temporary   foreign  workers,  refugee  claimants  and  people  with  a  temporary  resident  visa  on   humanitarian  grounds.      This  study  was  originally  intended  to  focus  only  on  temporary  foreign  workers,  

but  since,  as  will  be  shown,  it  was  not  possible  to  isolate  them  entirely,  the  scope  was   expanded  to  include  refugee  claimants  and  people  with  a  temporary  resident  visa  on   humanitarian  grounds.  The  low-skilled  NPR  population  in  this  analysis  is  the  reference   group  against  which  other  low-skilled  workers  (CB  and  IMM)  are  compared  since  NPRs   have  neither  citizenship  nor  the  rights  attached  to  it.        The  reason  for  including  refugee  claimants  and  people  with  a  temporary  resident  

125  

     

visa  on  humanitarian  grounds  is  that  these  groups  could  not  be  separated  from  TFWs.   More  specifically,  there  is  no  indicator  in  the  dataset  to  distinguish  TFWs  from  these   populations.  Although  the  literature  on  refugee  claimants  (asylum  seekers)  and  people   with  a  temporary  resident  visa  on  humanitarian  grounds  is  rather  scarce  and  focuses   primarily  on  refugees  (Jackson  &  Bauder,  2013),  some  important  differences  can   nevertheless  be  identified  between  these  two  groups  and  temporary  foreign  workers.   The  groups  have  different  rights  vis-a-vis  the  labour  market.  For  example,  low-skilled   TFWs  face  significant  challenges  to  change  employers  and  endure  harsh  labour   conditions  in  order  to  be  invited  the  following  year  (SAWPs)  or  to  become  permanent   residents  after  two  years  as  temporary  foreign  workers  (LICs).  Cases  documented  in   the  literature  include  both  live-in  caregivers  (Brickner  &  Straehle,  2010;  Faraday,  2012a)   and  agricultural  workers  (Wells  et  al.,  2014).  For  live-in  caregivers,  changing  employers   implies  leaving  the  Live-In  Caregiver  Program,  which  complicates  finding  a  new  job  and   obtaining  another  work  permit  (Dorow,  et  al.,  2015;  Langevin,  2007).  In  contrast,   temporary  residents  accepted  as  refugee  claimants  or  on  humanitarian  grounds  have   more  autonomy  in  changing  employers  and  have  access  to  many  of  the  rights  of   permanent  residents.  That  said,  refugee  claimants'  jobs  are  for  the  most  part  in   precarious  conditions  (Jackson  &  Bauder,  2013).      Though  it  would  have  been  ideal  to  separate  the  populations,  the  census  

database  does  not  include  a  "type  of  NPR"  flag,  which  makes  it  impossible  to  separate   them.  But  this  does  not  present  a  serious  obstacle  since  a  significant  number  of  NPRs   in  the  humanitarian  population  can  potentially  be  part  of  the  labour  market,  making  this   subpopulation  equally  relevant  for  a  labour  market  analysis  of  non-temporary  residents.  

126  

     

An  added  advantage  of  including  these  populations  is  that  it  increases  the  sample  size,   which  enhances  the  analysis  at  the  occupation-level.  
  

  

4.5.2.  Selection  of  those  who  did  not  attend  school  (to  filter  out  foreign  

students).  Foreign  students  were  filtered  out  of  the  analysis  by  using  the  flag   ATTSCHSUM  (Attendance  at  school  ­  summary),  which  focuses  on  total  attendance.   This  variable  gathers  information  about  those  who  attended  school  between  September   2005  and  May  16,  2006.  Those  who  "did  not  attend  school"  were  selected.    
  

  

4.5.3.  Selection  of  individuals  working  in  low-skilled  occupations.  

Occupations  describe  the  kind  of  activities  developed  at  the  workplace.  From  the   occupations  variable,  nochrd,  all  low-skilled  occupations  were  chosen.  Low-skilled   occupations  were  selected  based  on  the  2006  National  Occupational  Classification   (NOC)  system55.     This  dissertation  explores  in  detail,  the  absolute  wages  in  43  occupations  and  the   relative  wage  differences  (NPRs  relative  to  CB  and  IMM  or  NPR-CB  and  NPR-IMM)  in   35  occupations.  The  following  describes  the  way  in  which  these  occupations  were   derived.     Only  43  NOC  4  low-skilled  occupations  (C  and  D)  were  considered  in  this   analysis.  According  to  ESDC  (2016b),  there  are  521  occupations  altogether,  of  which   157  are  low-skilled  (see  appendix  four).  Privacy  restrictions  related  to  sample  size  led  to   the  omission  of  some  occupations:  only  low-skilled  occupations  with  enough  NPRs  to   satisfy  privacy  considerations  were  chosen,  reducing  the  number  to  98  occupations

(see  appendix  five).  Occupations  were  ranked  according  to  the  number  of  NPRs  in  each   occupation  and  organized  from  top  to  bottom  with  the  column  of  NPRs  as  the  reference.   In  all  cases  NPRs  are  the  smallest  of  all  three  populations  (CB,  IMM  and  NPRs).        With  only  98  occupations  remaining  after  fulfilling  Statistics  Canada's  privacy  

guidelines,  this  number  was  further  reduced  to  those  occupations  with  a  reliable  sample   size  for  the  NPR  population:  a  total  of  43  occupations.  The  analysis  focused  only  on  the   top  occupations,  ensuring  not  to  go  below  90  -  100  counts  in  the  weighted  sample.  This   threshold  reflects  the  fact  that  the  2006  census  consisted  of  a  single  sampling  of  20%  of   households,  so  the  unweighted  sample  has  roughly  one  fifth  of  the  population.  A   minimum  of  between  90  to  100  counts  (in  the  weighted  sample)  ensures  reliability  of  an   original  sample  of  20%,  which  also  ensures  that  observations  are  well  above  the   minimum  required  by  Statistics  Canada.  This  standard  is  maintained  with  all   populations,  although  it  is  particularly  relevant  for  NPRs  because  of  the  small  size  of   this  group.  This  number  was  further  reduced  to  35  occupations  for  the  relative  wages   analysis  (wage  differences  NPR-CB  and  NPR-IMM).  The  number  is  smaller  because  it   includes  only  the  occupations  that  passed  the  statistical  tests  to  validate  comparison  of   means  (Bonferroni  tests,  which  will  be  explained  later  in  this  chapter).      When  the  population  is  dissected  even  more  by  other  characteristics  (sex,  

province  of  residence,  etc.),  the  number  of  occupations  in  each  category  is  again   reduced  to  not  to  go  below  90  -100  counts.    
  

4.5.4.  Selection  of  those  "employed"  and  "paid."  This  study  includes  only   those  who  reported  being  employed  to  ensure  that  all  cases  in  the  sample  are  in  equal   standing  vis-à-vis  employment  at  the  moment  of  the  census.  This  selection  was  made   128  
     

using  the  variable  LFTAG  (Labour  Market  Activities:  Labour  Force  Activity),  which  refers   to  the  type  of  labour  activity  developed  in  the  week  prior  to  census  (Statistics  Canada,   2006  Census  Codebook,  p.624).  For  this  study,  it  is  important  to  not  only  have  labour   activity,  but  to  also  be  paid  for  that  activity  (i.e.  to  not  be  self-employed).  This  selection   was  made  via  the  variable  COWD  (Class  of  Worker  ­  Derived),  which  provides   information  on  whether  a  person  was  paid  for  their  labour.  
  

4.5.5.  Selection  of  those  working  full-time.  Since  TFWs  are  expected  to   financially  support  themselves  while  in  Canada,  the  Canadian  government  generally   approves  only  those  committed  to  work  in  full-time  jobs  (CIC,  2006).  To  maintain  a  basis   for  comparing  TFWs  with  CB  and  IMM,  this  analysis  accordingly  focuses  only  on  those   workers  in  low-skilled  occupations  working  full-time,  which  the  census  designates  as  30   hours  or  more  per  week  (see  appendix  3B  for  a  more  detailed  definition).  
  

  

4.5.6.  Exclusion  of  outliers.56  For  statistical  reasons  and  for  accuracy,  I  have  

excluded  outliers.  This  is  a  common  statistical  approach  to  avoid  skewing  the  outcomes.   As  Osborne  and  Overbay  (2004)  report:  "accuracy  tends  to  increase  significantly  and   substantially,  and  errors  of  inference  tend  to  drop  significantly  and  substantially  once   extreme  scores  [are]  removed"  (p.1).  In  this  study,  less  than  0.1%  of  the  cases  were   withdrawn,57  using  the  stem  and  leaf  methodology58  in  SPSS,  so  as  to  not  alter  

                                                                                                 
56

  Econometric  analysis  shows  that  wages  are  usually  not  normally  distributed  (Wooldridge,  2012).  This   means  that,  when  plotted,  the  distribution  of  wages  is,  for  the  most  part,  skewed  to  right,  which  means   that  there  are  significantly  high  values  to  the  right  of  the  mean.  In  this  research,  a  distribution  of  wages   skewed  to  the  right  means  that  there  are  cases  in  which  wages  are  significantly  higher  than  the  mean   value  (outliers).           57   Privacy  considerations  do  not  allow  any  explicit  information  on  this  matter.  

129  

     

averages.  Such  outliers  have  the  potential  to  significantly  affect  the  estimates  of  a  linear   model  (Andrews  &  Pregibon,  1978),  which  is  the  model  used  in  the  regression  analysis   included  in  this  research,  as  well  as  T-tests  and  ANOVA  tests  (Osborne  and  Overbay,   2004).  Even  after  outliers  were  withdrawn,  average  wages  in  some  occupations   remained  relatively  high.  A  way  to  address  this  issue  will  be  explained  in  detail  in  section   4.7.        It  is  important  to  remember  that  the  census  is  a  database  that  collects  all  

information  about  Canadians,  which  makes  it  extremely  important  to  have  guidelines  in   place  that  preserve  the  privacy  of  those  surveyed.  Since  relatively  small  sample  sizes   have  a  greater  potential  for  revealing  private  information  concerning  individual   respondents,  census  protocols  do  not  allow  public  dissemination  of  any  information   about  outliers,  which  make  up  a  very  small  sample  size.  This  is  especially  relevant  when   dealing  with  variables  with  sensitive  information,  such  as  wages.        In  this  analysis,  the  mean  wage  (as  opposed  to  the  median  or  mode)  was  the  

measure  chosen  to  explore  wages  of  low-skilled  workers.  While  each  measure  has  its

  A  Stem  and  Leaf  Plot  is  a  mathematical/visual  tool  that  permits  establishing  how  numbers  in  a  series  of   observations  are  distributed.  This  methodology  is  useful  to  identify  outliers.  In  this  procedure,  a  series  of   numbers  is  separated  into  the  "leaf"  (usually  the  last  digit),  and  the  "stem"  (the  other  digits).  For  example,   a  series  of  17  observations  (10,  23,  28,  36,  37,  39,  40,  42,  44,  48,  49,  50,  56,  58,  63,  67,  89)  can  be   represented  as  follows:         Stem   leaf   leaf   leaf   leaf      1   0      2   3   8      3   6   7   9      4   0   2   4   9      5   0   6   8      6   3   7      8   9         Note  that  the  number  23  is  divided  into  2  (stem)  and  3  (leaf).      From  this  exercise,  numbers  below  20  and  above  80  have  fewer  occurrences  than  numbers  between  20   and  70.  The  software  used  in  this  analysis  (SPSS),  includes  a  stem  and  leaf  option  that  determines   outliers  in  a  series  of  observations.    

130  

     

own  strengths  and  weaknesses,  the  mean  wage  was  chosen  because,  after   withdrawing  outliers,  it  provides  a  good  representation  of  the  sample.  Moreover,   contrary  to  the  mode  or  the  median,  the  mean  is  calculated  in  light  of  all  of  the  values  in   the  sample,  which  makes  it  a  measure  that  ensures  inclusion  of  all  observations.  Finally,   finding  the  average  wage  (i.e.  the  mean)  is  a  technique  used  in  economic  studies   comparing  wages  in  relation  to  immigration  (Borjas,  et  al.,  2008;  Card,  2009).  It  is  an   international  measure  that  may  allow  the  results  of  this  analysis  to  be  compared  with   other  international  studies  on  labour  market  analysis.        To  overcome  the  limitations  of  calculating  averages,  a  quartile  analysis  will  be  

introduced  (see  also  appendix  eight).      4.6.  Data  Limitations      This  section  includes  the  various  data  limitations  that  I  faced  throughout  the  

research.   -  Weekly  hours  of  work.  I  originally  wanted  to  include  in  my  analysis  the  weekly   hours  of  labour  because  this  variable  not  only  represents  a  significant  outcome  in  the   labour  market;  it  also  encapsulates  relevant  information  about  the  experiences  of  low- skilled  temporary  foreign  workers  in  Canada.  However,  limitations  in  the  available  data   did  not  allow  for  any  robust  conclusions  about  the  relationship  between  hours  of  work   and  the  labour  market  experiences  of  low-skilled  workers  in  Canada.   -  Difficulties  with  the  data  itself.  The  Canadian  census  is  a  rich  and  complex   database  that  demands  many  hours  of  work  of  data  extraction  and  imposes  a  steep   learning  curve.  While  providing  the  most  granular  data  available  at  the  level  of  

131  

     

occupations,  the  census  nevertheless  does  not  provide  a  complete  picture,  especially   when  attempting  to  account  for  wage  differences.  Even  after  eliminating  obvious   outliers,59  cases  with  high  values  still  persist,  which  also  drive  the  average  wage  to  a   high  value.  As  will  be  further  explained  appendix  eight,  identified  sources  of  wage   dispersion  include  the  way  in  which  occupational  groups  are  grouped  together.  High   average  wages  will  be  addressed  by  dividing  the  population  in  each  occupation  into   quartiles,  an  approach  that  will  be  explained  in  detail  later  in  this  chapter  as  well  as  in   chapter  six.     -  Prime  age  (25-54  years  of  age)  analysis.  I  originally  intended  to  engage  in  a   "Prime  Age"  cross  tabulation  analysis,  which  aimed  at  comparing  the  wages,  by   occupation,  of  those  in  the  age  range  25-54  with  those  below  and  above  that  age  range.   However,  sample  sizes  did  not  allow  such  analysis  at  the  occupation  level.  Cross   tabulating  age  against  wage  by  dividing  age  into  other  subcategories  was  also   impossible  because  of  inadequate  sample  sizes.  Despite  these  difficulties,  age  remains   a  relevant  variable  in  my  analysis  and  is  accordingly  factored  into  the  regression   analysis.      -  Ethnic  origin  and  place  of  birth  analysis.  I  originally  considered  analyzing  the  

data  in  light  of  ethnic  origin,  but  in  the  end  decided  to  remain  with  the  variable  of  one's   country  of  birth  as  a  proxy,  which  was  already  included  in  my  analysis.  Having  'Ethnic   Origin'  and  'Place  of  Birth'  at  the  same  time  would  have  introduced  co-linearity60  to  the   regression  analysis,  which  should  be  avoided.

  See  section  4.5.6.  of  this  chapter.     Collinearity  effects  between  two  or  more  categories/variables  are  present  when  the  observations  in   each  of  them  are  similar  in  magnitude,  proportion  or  value.  Having  different  categories/variables  with   similar  magnitudes/proportions/values  in  a  regression  model  makes  it  difficult  to  separate  the  effects  of   each  of  them  on  a  dependent  variable.

4.7.  Quartiles  Analysis      A  way  to  address  the  persistence  of  high  wage  values  (even  after  eliminating  

outliers)  in  some  subsamples  (or  a  significant  dispersion  of  the  data)  is  to  determine   mean  wages  per  quartile.  Quartiles  refer  to  the  division  of  a  sample  into  four  parts   according  to  an  equidistant  division  of  the  entire  wage  range  in  the  sample.  Thus,  the   first  quartile  groups  together  the  lowest  wages  and  the  last  quartile  the  highest.  A   quartile  analysis  provides  a  closer  look  into  the  differences  within  each  sub-section   (quartile)  by  occupation.  Each  population  (CB,  IMM  and  NPR)  in  each  occupation  is   divided  according  to  their  wages.  The  lowest  and  highest  wage  in  each  of  these  three   status  categories  (CB,  IMM,  NPR)  is  used  to  define  the  wage  range,  which  is  then   divided  into  four  equal  parts  or  quartiles.  To  be  clear,  then,  the  quartiles  reflect  the   distribution  of  hourly  earnings  from  highest  to  lowest  (and  the  distribution  of  workers)-- based  on  equal  proportion  of  wage  ranges  and  not  on  equal  proportion  of  number  of   workers.  The  average  wage  is  calculated  for  each  quartile  since  four  average  wages  per   group  provide  a  better  representation  of  the  differences  in  wages  in  each  occupation.   For  example,  the  following  (Table  1)  presents  a  hypothetical  case  of  the  wage   distribution  by  quartiles  and  by  population  type  in  occupation  X:                    

133  

     

Table  1:  Quartile  Ranges  Divide   Wage  ranges  by  population  (dollars  per  hour)   Canadian-born   wage  range     from  $15  to  $37     Quartile  1   from  $15  to  $20   Quartile  2   from  $21  to  $26   Quartile  3   from  $27  to  $32   Quartile  4   from  $32  to  $37   Table  1:  Quartile  Ranges  Divide   Quartiles   Immigrant     wage  range   from  $12  to  $31   from  $12  to  $16   from  $17  to  $21   from  $22  to  $26   from  $27  to  $31   NPR     wage  range   from  $8  to  $23     from  $8  to  $11   from  $12  to  $15   from  $16  to  $19   from  $20  to  $23  

   This  procedure  helps  to  verify  whether  the  comparison  of  mean  hourly  wages  of  NPRs   versus  CB  or  IMM  in  a  subsample  is  sound  despite  the  broad  dispersion  of  wages.   Although  the  analysis  uses  mean  wages  per  immigration  category  (three  categories  -   CB,  IMM  and  NPR)  and  per  additional  independent  variable  (ex.  mean  wages  both  by   immigration  status  and  by  sex),  mean  wages  per  quartile  were  used  in  some  parts  of   the  analysis.  The  average  of  the  second  and  third  quartiles  was  used  in  some  cases  to   verify  whether  what  was  found  for  the  whole  sample  persists  in  quartiles  2  and  3.  It  is   used  as  a  complement  to  the  mean  hourly  wage  analysis  for  specific  intrinsic   characteristics  and  the  results  are  included  in  chapter  seven  and  in  the  appendices   (appendix  nine).      4.8.  Reliability  Tests   4.8.1.  Anova  (Analysis  of  Variance)  test.  The  Analysis  of  Variance  (or  ANOVA),   is  a  statistical  test  used  to  compare  the  means  of  more  than  two  sets  of  observations.  It   is  based  on  contrasting  the  means  to  be  compared  in  view  of  dispersions  in   observations  linked  to  each  mean.  Dispersion  is  measured  through  the  standard  

134  

     

deviation  (Sirkin,  2006).  In  this  research,  the  ANOVA  tests  help  to  evaluate  whether  the   mean  wages  among  different  types  of  low-skilled  workers  are  statistically  equal.        These  methods  of  comparisons  are  used  for  the  top  occupations  and  top  industry  

sectors  that  the  privacy  restrictions  allow  to  make  public.  For  each  occupation  and   industry  sector,  mean  wages  for  each  legal  status  categories  (CB,  IMM  and  NPR)  is   compared  by  type  of  independent  variable  (sex,  level  of  education,  etc).  Thus,  the   analysis  compares  the  mean  wages  by  immigration  status  and  independent  variable  in   each  occupation  and  industry  sector.  The  ANOVA  tests  help  to  establish  whether  mean   wages  by  type  of  immigration  status  are  statistically  equal.  It  evaluates  the  null   hypothesis  of  whether  the  means  to  be  compared  are  equal  in  value  (Sirkin,  2006;   Quirk,  2012).  Since  the  independent  variable  is  thought  to  affect  the  dependent  variable,   this  analysis  compares  the  effects  across  the  different  kinds  of  immigration  status.  This   is  done  because  this  research  explores  the  effects  of  citizenship  (or  lack  of  thereof)  on   wages  in  each  category  of  each  independent  variable.  For  example,  the  research   compares  the  wages  of  TFW  women  working  in  occupation  `x'  with  those  of  Canadian- born  women  and  immigrant  women  working  in  the  same  occupation.      Independent  variables  in  this  research  are  considered  in  light  of  the  first,  second  

or  third  levels  of  analysis.  The  first  level  of  analysis  refers  to  the  first  layer  of  analysis   across  which  comparisons  take  place.  In  this  analysis,  occupations  and  industry  sectors   are  independent  variables  at  the  first  level  of  analysis  (mean  wages  are  considered  by   occupation  and  by  industry  sector).  A  subsequent  level  of  complexity  is  introduced  by   adding  a  second  level  of  analysis,  immigration  status,  which  is  considered  the  only   independent  variable  at  the  second  level  of  analysis.  Thus,  wages  are  compared  not  

135  

     

only  by  occupation  and  by  industry  sector,  but  also  across  the  different  kinds  of   immigration  statuses  (CB,  IMM  and  TFW).        The  level  of  complexity  is  further  increased  by  adding  a  third  layer  of  analysis.  

Independent  variables  including  sex,  the  first  official  language  spoken,  and  the  level  of   education,  are  considered  to  be  at  the  third  level  of  analysis.  In  summary,  the  population   is  first  grouped  by  occupation  and  by  industry  sector.  Then  each  occupation  and   industry  sector  is  subdivided  by  immigration  status.  Within  the  group  of  occupations,   each  immigration  status  is  subsequently  subdivided  by  province  of  residence,  sex,  level   of  education,  etc.  Hence,  the  analysis  compares  wages  at  second  and  third  levels  of   analysis.      To  understand  ANOVA,  it  helps  to  imagine  a  sample  that  is  divided  into  two  

subsamples.  The  mean  of  the  whole  sample,  as  well  as  the  means  of  each  subsample,   are  then  calculated.  The  ANOVA  test  evaluates  how  different  the  variabilities  around  the   mean  of  each  subsample  are  from  the  variability  around  the  mean  of  the  whole  sample.   Knowing  this  helps  to  evaluate  the  subsamples  with  respect  to  the  whole  group  of   observations  (Sirkin,  2006).  This  test  helps  to  evaluate  whether  there  are  differences   between  subsamples.  In  this  case,  it  would  help  us  assess  whether  the  mean  wage  of   immigrants  working  in  occupation  `x'  is  different  from  the  mean  wage  of  NPRs  working   in  the  same  occupation.        Mathematically,  the  ANOVA  serves  to  determine  the  veracity  of  the  hypothesis  of  

whether  or  not  the  means  of  more  than  two  groups  are  equal.  The  test  calculates  an  F- test  value.  This  value  is  contrasted  against  the  associated  degrees  of  freedom  to  see   whether  it  falls  within  a  zone  of  acceptance  or  rejection  of  an  F-distribution.  

136  

     

The  F-test  in  its  basic  form  is:   F=Mean  square  between  groups  (MSb)  /  Mean  square  within  groups  (MSw)   F  =MSb/MSw  (Quirk,  2012).      This  is  explained  step-by-step  in  appendix  six.  In  the  case  of  comparing  more  

than  2  groups,  one  sample  for  which  a  characteristic  is  measured  under  different   conditions,  for  example,  a  group  of  people  whose  body  temperature  is  measured  in  `m'   different  situations,  which  generates  an  `m'  number  of  "groups."  Thus,  all  groups  have   the  same  number  of  observations  because  each  group  corresponds  to  the  same   sample.  The  procedure  used  to  calculate  the  ANOVA  is  found  in  appendix  six.  The   ANOVA  tests  and  the  post  hoc  test  help  evaluate  whether  the  mean  wages  seen  at   second-  and  third-levels  of  analysis  are  comparable  given  values  and  samples  sizes.   The  ANOVA  test  helps  evaluate  whether  the  means  are  significantly  different  (in   statistical  terms),  but  not  which  is  different  from  the  others  (Sirkin,  2006;  Quirk,  2012).   This  is  addressed  by  using  a  post  hoc  test  (Sirkin,  2006),  which,  for  this  research,  is  the   Bonferroni  Test.      4.8.2.  Post  hoc  (Bonferroni)  test.  There  are  several  post  hoc  tests.  The  first  on   the  list  is  the  Least  Significant  Difference  (LSD)  test.  The  LSD  test,  was  developed  by   Ronald  Fisher  in  1935  and  is  based  on  several  individual  t-tests  pulled  from  all  groups   to  be  tested.  The  LSD  test  "does  not  control  for  the  probability  of  rejecting  a  hypothesis   that  some  pairs  of  means  are  different"  (Williams,  2004).  Details  about  the  LSD   Bonferroni  test  are  found  in  appendix  seven.  The  Bonferroni  test  is  perhaps  the  most   broadly  used  to  compare  multiple  means  because  it  is  flexible  enough  and  its  

137  

     

calculation  is  very  straightforward.  An  SPSS  Bonferroni  output  evaluating  the  mean   differences  of  "Hours  of  labour"  in  occupation  "X"  would  be  framed  according  to  Table  2:

   Summary   In  summary,  this  chapter  presented  the  research  questions  and  hypothesis,  as   well  as  the  methods  used  and  the  limitations  of  each  method  used.  It  explained  the   datasets,  variables  and  decisions  made  in  response  to  each  of  the  challenges  faced.  It   also  discussed  why  wages  are  important  means  for  evaluating  labour  market  outcomes   of  low-skilled  NPRs  compared  to  those  of  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  workers.  It   recognized  the  2006  census  as  the  best  dataset  to  evaluate  labour  market  outcomes  of   low-skilled  temporary  foreign  workers  at  the  beginning  of  the  exponential  increase  in   temporary  foreign  low-skilled  labour  identified  in  the  literature.  It  also  provided  a   methodology  to  evaluate  wage  differences  and  the  impact  of  lack  of  citizenship  on   wages  than  can  be  replicated  with  future  censuses.     Having  defined  the  methods  used  and  considerations,  the  following  four  chapters   138  
     

(five,  six,  seven  and  eight)  present  the  quantitative  analysis  as  follows:  the  profile  of   low-skilled  labour  in  Canada  (chapter  five);  the  outcomes  of  the  descriptive  analysis  via   the  quartile  analysis  and  the  cross-tabulation  analysis  at  the  industry  and  occupation   level  (chapter  six);  The  outcomes  of  the  cross-tabulation  analysis  by  each  of  the  intrinsic   characteristics  (chapter  seven);  and,  the  outcomes  of  the  regression  analysis  (chapter   eight).  Those  four  quantitative  chapters  are  shorter  than  the  other  chapters  in  the   dissertation.  This  is  because  they  deal  with  discrete  empirical  material,  each  addressing   specific  quantitative  research  aspects  of  the  dissertation.  The  nature  of  presenting  this   material  entails  more  detail  and  its  presentation  lends  itself  to  shorter  more  focused   presentation.  Nevertheless,  throughout,  my  key  research  question  remains  the  effect  of   lack  of  citizenship  on  wages  of  low-skilled  NPRs.

Chapter  Five:  A  Profile  of  Low-Skilled  Workers  in  Canada      This  chapter  presents  a  demographic  profile  of  all  low-skilled  workers  in  Canada,  

with  an  emphasis  on  low-skilled  Non-Permanent  Residents.  Drawing  on  the  2015   Labour  Force  Survey  (LFS)  as  well  as  2006  census  data,  this  profile  provides  a  context   for  analyzing  the  wages  of  low-skilled  NPRs  vis-a-vis  those  of  CB  and  IMM  to  identify   and  explain  important  differences.  Thus,  this  profile  runs  in  two  different  time  frames:   2015  and  2006.  The  two  timeframes  provide  a  nuanced  and  focused  perspective  on  the   current  situation  of  low-skilled  labour  in  Canada,  especially  NPRs,  as  well  as  a  general   overview  of  the  characteristics  typical  of  the  low-skilled  population  without  citizenship  in   contrast  with  the  low-skilled  population  with  citizenship  used  in  this  study.  Highlights  of   the  profile  include:  Retail  is  the  occupation  with  the  highest  number  of  total  low-skilled   workers  in  Canada;  occupations  in  caregiving  and  agriculture  stand  out  as  having  the   highest  number  of  low-skilled  NPRs,  with  caregiving  having  a  significant  concentration   not  only  among  low-skilled  female  NPRs  but  among  all  low-skilled  NPRs.  The   Philippines  and  Mexico  stand  out  as  the  origin-countries  with  the  highest  numbers  of   low-skilled  NPRs.      This  chapter  is  divided  into  five  parts.  In  the  first  part  I  situate  low-skilled  

temporary  foreign  labour  within  the  broader  low-skilled  labour  market  in  Canada  and   present  the  context  for  low-skilled  TFW  programs.  In  the  second  part,  I  present  the  four   programs  (streams)  through  which  employers  can  hire  low-skilled  temporary  foreign   workers  in  Canada.  In  the  third  part,  I  provide  an  overview  of  the  precariousness   experienced  by  low-skilled  labourers  and  demonstrate  how  they  are  systematically   marginalized  from  the  labour  market.  In  the  fourth  part  I  focus  on  the  distribution  of  low-

140  

     

skilled  workers  throughout  Canada's  industry  sectors  and  occupations,  the  focal   population  of  this  dissertation.  In  the  fifth  part  I  focus  on  the  characteristics  of  all  low- skilled  workers.  I  present  a  demographic  comparison  between  low-skilled  NPRs  and   low-skilled  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  labourers,  in  view  of  occupation,  province  of   residence,  sex  and  country  of  origin.     5.1.  Temporary  Foreign  Low-Skilled  Workers­  Context      Using  the  2006  Census,  Derrick  Thomas'  (2010)  identifies  112  000  NPRs  (high  

and  low-skilled)  (Thomas,  2010).  Of  that  total,  94  000  work  full  time  (working  more  than   30  hours  a  week)  (Thomas,  2010).  The  federal  government  argues  that  temporary   foreign  worker  programs  are  important  for  "Canada's  economic  growth"  (CIC,  2006,  as   cited  in  Nakache  &  Kinoshita,  2010,  p.3)  and  that  they  are  a  "principal  tool  to  help   employers  meet  immediate  skill  requirements  when  qualified  Canadian  workers  cannot   be  found"  (Finance  Canada,  2007,  as  cited  in  Nakache  &  Kinoshita,  2010,  p.3).        Temporary  foreign  low-skilled  labour,  which  is  included  in  the  group  `noncitizens"  

in  the  PEPSO  report  (Dyson  et  al.,  2013;  2015),  belongs  to  the  rapidly  expanding  labour   force,  which  is  characterized  by  flexibility,  vulnerability,  and  precarity  (Fudge,  2012).   This  new  workforce  can  be  viewed  as  socially-constructed  (Sharma,  2006)  and  as  part   of  the  new  Post-Fordist  labour  class  (Sharma,  2006  as  cited  in  Fudge,  2012,  p.  95).          As  explained  in  chapter  three,  in  June  2014,  the  old  TFW  program  was  divided  

into  two  different  programs  (CIC,  2014):  1)  the  Temporary  Foreign  Worker  Program,   which  targets  low-skilled  workers  and  is  said  to  fill  gaps  in  the  labour  market;  and  2)  the   International  Mobility  Program,  which  provides  access  to  high-skilled  jobs  and  is   designed  to  fulfill  bilateral  agreements,  such  as  NAFTA,  and  meet  reciprocity  

141  

     

requirements  (CIC,  2014).

Under  the  new  structure,  it  is  accordingly  more  accurate  to  consider  the  number  

of  "Temporary  Residence  Work  Permit  Holders",  to  include  both  programs.  From  this   perspective,  the  total  number  of  Temporary  Residence  Work  Permit  Holders  arriving   annually  in  Canada  has  significantly  increased,  surpassing  the  number  of  individuals   admitted  as  permanent  residents  (see  Figure  1).  Between  2004  and  2014,  the  total   number  of  Temporary  Residence  Work  Permit  Holders  has  increased  by  185%.  A  study   published  in  2010,  before  the  split  of  the  Temporary  Worker  Program,  indicates  that  the   highest  percentage  of  increases  in  TFW  are  among  low-skilled  workers,  a  tendency  that   corresponds  with  the  intention  to  ease  access  to  foreign  low-skilled  labour  (Nakache  &   Kinoshita,  2010).  Having  provided  a  general  overview  of  TFWs  in  Canada,  we  will  now   turn  to  the  place  of  low-skilled  labour  in  the  Canadian  economy.

In  2015,  Stats  Canada  identified  17.9  million  employed  individuals,  of  whom  14.4  

million  (or  81%)  worked  full-time  and  3.4  million  (or  19%)  worked  part-time  job  (see   Figure  2).

As  indicated  in  Figure  3A,  of  all  the  17.9  million  people  employed,  3.8  million  (or   143  
     

21.2%)  were  low-skilled  and  14.1  million  (or  78.8%)  were  high-skilled.  That  is,   approximately  one  in  every  five  employed  persons  is  low-skilled.

Focusing  only  on  those  with  full-time  employment,  Figure  3B  also  shows  that  the  

proportion  of  low-skilled  workers  in  full-time  jobs  is  quite  low  at  19%  (or  2.8  million);61  in   contrast,  high-skilled  workers  fill  81%  (or  11.7  million)  of  the  full-time  positions.  The   proportions  change  when  the  focus  shifts  to  those  working  part-time  (Figure  3C);  while   2.4  million  (or  70%)  are  high-skilled,  1.0  million  (or  30%)  are  low-skilled.      Workers  without  a  degree,  certificate  or  diploma  (low-skilled),  or,  with  a  

postsecondary  certificate  but  without  high  school  graduation  (also  low-skilled),  have  the   lowest  rates  of  employment.  In  2015,  the  employment  rate  for  those  without  a  degree,

  While  the  Labour  Force  Survey  (LFS)  counted  approximately  2.8  million  low-skilled  workers  in  full-time   occupations  in  2015,  the  2006  census  counted  approximately  3.1  million.  Although  these  numbers  should   not  be  compared  (they  come  from  different  sources),  it  is  nevertheless  worthwhile  to  note  the  following:   after  February  2015,  LFS  estimates,  originally  based  on  2006  census,  were  based  on  the  2011  census.   The  2011  census  had  a  2.3%  undercoverage  rate  (which  refers  to  people  who  were  not  counted  but   should  have  been).  Differences  in  population  estimates  for  each  year  between  2006  and  2010  (based  on   the  2006  and  2011  censuses)  vary  between  approximately  1-  4%.  For  details  refer  to  Stats  Canada   (2015).

certificate  or  diploma  was  33%  and  for  those  with  a  postsecondary  certificate  but   without  high  school  graduation  it  was  48%  (see  Figure  4).  These  percentages  stand  in   sharp  contrast  with  high-skilled  workers  in  other  categories  (close  to  60%  or  above   70%).  The  employment  rate  in  this  category  dropped  from  34%  in  2011  to  32.6%  in   2015  (Labour  Force  Survey,  2015).

Not  only  are  employment  rates  among  low-skilled  workers  low;  research  also  

indicates  that  low-skilled  jobs  are  becoming  increasingly  temporary  (i.e.  contract,   seasonal  or  casual)  and  that  the  number  of  temporary  jobs  has  been  increasing  (Amine,   2012).  Employers  often  favour  temporary  jobs  because  they  contribute  to  a  flexible   labour  force,  which  allows  them  to  compete  globally,  respond  to  downturns  in  the   economy  and  "adapt  to  changes  in  the  market"  (Amine,  2012  p.95).      Most  workers  employed  in  low-skilled  jobs  are  racialized  immigrants,  racialized   145  
     

Canadian-born  workers  and  noncitizens  (Dyson  et  al.,  2013).  These  groups  are  the   most  likely  to  work  in  precarious  conditions,  experience  discrimination  and  report  labour   insecurity  and  poor  general  health  (Dyson  et  al.,  2015).  This  situation  gives  rise  to  a   labour  class  in  which  workers  have  to  struggle  just  to  survive,  juggling  different  part-time   jobs,  with  low  pay,  poor  benefits,  little  job  security  and  a  very  low  quality  of  life  (Dyson  et   al.,  2013;  2015).      5.3.  Low-skilled  Workers  in  Canada   Now  the  profile  of  low-skilled  labour  in  Canada  draws  on  2006  census  data,   which  corresponds  only  to  low-skilled  workers  working  full-time.  Full-time  cases  were   selected  to  enable  wage  comparisons  between  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  workers   on  the  one  hand  and  NPRs,  who  are  all  full-time,  on  the  other.  Most  of  the  labour  force   in  Canada  is  comprised  of  Canadian-born  individuals  (Kustek,  2012)  and  the  low-skilled   population  detailed  in  this  study  reflects  a  predominance  of  Canadian-born  and   immigrant  workers.  Of  approximately  3.1  million  full-time  low-skilled  workers  identified  in   this  study  (accounting  for  the  case-selection  criteria  described  in  chapter  four),  0.9%  are   NPRs,  76,4%  are  CB,  and  22.7%  are  IMM  (which  is  made  up  of  naturalized  Canadians   and  permanent  residents).  These  proportions  correspond  closely  with  the  proportions   for  the  total  labour  force  (high-  and  low-skilled  combined),  especially  between  the  CB   and  IMM  (77.1%  CB,  21.2%  IMM  and  1.7%  NPRs)  (Kustek,  2012).  As  already   explained,  the  differences  between  2015  data  and  2006  data  are  linked  to  the  fact  that   the  2015  data  from  the  Labour  Force  Survey  is  based  on  data  from  the  2011  National   Household  Survey,  which  has  been  criticized  for  the  low  rate  of  respondents.

5.3.1.  Low-skilled  labour  in  Canada  and  industry  sector.  In  this  analysis   industry  sectors  follow  the  North  American  Industry  Classification  System  (NAICS)62   from  2006,  which  divides  the  economy  into  20  industry  sectors.  Of  these  20  sectors,  this   research  reports  on  those  with  a  statistically  significant  number  of  NPRs,  which   amounts  to  a  total  of  13  industry  sectors.  NPRs  are  the  reference  group  and  generally   represent  the  smaller  group  vis-a-vis  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  workers.

Figure  5  presents  the  distribution  of  all  low-skilled  workers,  according  to  

immigration  status  and  the  13  selected  industry  sectors.  This  research  compares   outcomes  according  to  the  following  three  immigration  statuses:  Canadian-born,   immigrant  (naturalized  Canadians  and  permanent  residents)  and  Non-Permanent   Residents.  The  data  from  the  2006  census  reflects  the  low-skilled  Canadian  economy

prior  to  the  2008  recession.  Manufacturing  appears  to  be  the  sector  with  the  highest   number  of  low-skilled  labourers  (600  000),  followed  by  Retail  (375  000);  Healthcare  and   Social  Assistance  (235  000);  and,  Transportation  and  Warehousing  (210  000).  While  the   manufacturing  sector  has  been  an  important  user  of  low-skilled  workers  in  the  past,   more  than  320  000  jobs  have  disappeared  between  2004  and  2008  (Bernard,  2009).      Regarding  employment  opportunities  for  low-skilled  workers,  Canada  continues  

to  need  low-skilled  workers.  In  Canada,  8  of  the  top  10  occupations  (low-  and  high- skilled)  with  the  highest  vacancies  for  the  third  quarter  of  2015  were  low-skilled,  with  the   highest  number  of  vacancies  (27  320)  in  the  retail  sector.  When  considering  these   figures,  it  is  important  to  note  that  the  relatively  high  number  of  low-skilled  job  vacancies   is  not  necessarily  indicative  of  growth  in  low-skilled  sectors,  but  rather  of  labour  market   conditions  and  other  characteristics  intrinsic  to  the  occupations  themselves.  For   example,  as  shown  in  Figure  5,  in  2006,  the  retail  industry  sector  was  the  second   highest  employer  of  low-skilled  workers  in  the  Canadian  labour  market  (approximately   374  000  low-skilled  workers);  the  next  section  on  occupations  shows  retail  as  the   occupation  with  the  highest  number  of  low-skilled  workers  (about  260  000  low-skilled   workers).  While  one  might  expect  that  such  a  large  number  of  job  openings  is  simply  a   function  of  the  size  of  this  sector,  it  is  important  to  also  consider  that  retail  jobs  tend  to   have  a  high  labour  turnover  rate  (Galarneau,  2016).  The  large  number  of  vacancies   may  also  reflect  other  aspects  of  retail  jobs,  including  low  wages  and  a  large  number  of   part-time  and  seasonal  positions  (Dyson  et  al.,  2013).

While  the  industry  sectors  analysis  showed  retail  as  the  second  industry  with  the  

highest  number  of  low-skilled  workers  (after  manufacturing),  at  the  occupation  level,   retail  takes  the  lead.  Figure  6  shows  occupation  NOC  6421  -  Retail  Salespersons  and   sales  clerks  as  the  number  one  low-skilled  occupation  in  Canada  with  about  260  000   low-skilled  workers.  This  occupation  is  followed  by  occupation  NOC  7411  -  Truck   Drivers  with  about  178  000  low-skilled  workers.  A  list  showing  the  percentage  of   workers,  grouped  according  to  immigration  status,  for  each  occupation  among  the  top   occupations  (Table  3)  further  nuances  these  results.63

  Of  all  low-skilled  occupations,  this  research  focuses  on  those  in  the  2006  census  that  had  a  minimum   of  90  NPRs.  Occupations  6661  "Light  Duty  Cleaners";  6663  "Janitors;  Caretakers  and  Building   Superintendents";  6623  "Other  elemental  sales  occupations";  9498  "Other  assemblers  and  inspectors";   9483  "Electronic  assemblers,  fabricators,  and  testers";  6464  "Occupations  unique  to  the  armed  forces"   were  left  out  of  the  wage  analysis  because  the  mean  wages  by  immigrations  status  (CB,  IMM  and  TFW)   were  not  statistically  comparable.

5.4.  How  do  NPRs  Compare  to  Other  Low-Skilled  Workers  by  Occupation?      5.4.1.  NPR  low-skilled  workers  in  Canada  concentrate  around  five   occupations  in  caregiving  and  agriculture.  As  indicated  in  Table  3,  Retail   Salespersons  and  sales  clerks  is  the  top  occupation  among  the  Canadian-born  and   immigrant  populations.  In  contrast,  NOC-6474  Babysitters  and  Nannies  and  parents'   helpers  is  the  top  occupation  among  NPRs  with  27%  of  all  NPRs  in  low-skilled   occupations.   Among  Canadian-born  low-skilled  workers,  the  top  3  occupations  account  for  21.1%   of  all  CB  low-skilled  workers.  Among  the  low-skilled  immigrant  population,  the  top  three   occupations  represent  15.4%  of  all  low-skilled  immigrants.  In  contrast,  the  top  three   occupations  among  the  NPR  population  represents  37.6%  of  the  total  of  NPRs,   indicating  that  there  is  a  higher  concentration  of  NPRs  in  fewer  occupations.  The  top   occupation  (6474  Babysitters,  nannies  and  parents'  helpers)  alone  takes  27%  of  all  low- skilled  NPRs  in  this  study,  a  very  high  concentration.  The  concentration  of  low-skilled   workers  in  certain  occupations,  according  to  their  immigration  status,  points  to  the   importance  of  investigating  their  actual  wages.   Table  3  presents  low-skilled  occupations  that  belong  to  the  skill  levels  C  and  D.     Level  C  includes  occupations  that  usually  require  high  school  and  occupation  specific   training.  Level  D  classifies  occupations  that  require  on-the-job  training.  In  this  study,   occupations  in  both  levels  are  grouped  together  since  the  final  goal  is  to  compare   wages  of  low-skilled  workers  according  to  immigration  status

5.4.2.  Province  of  residence:  NPR  low-skilled  workers  have  the  highest  

share  in  Ontario.  In  this  research,  the  distribution  of  low-skilled  workers  into  categories   (CB,  IMM  and  NPR)  reflects  the  general  distribution  across  Canada.  In  all  three   immigration  categories,  the  largest  percentage  of  low-skilled  workers  is  based  in   Ontario,  which  is  the  Canadian  province  with  the  largest  population  and  the  largest   economy.  When  all  three  categories  are  combined,  Ontario's  share  of  all  low-skilled   workers  in  Canada  is  38.9%,  followed  by  Quebec  (24.1%),  British  Columbia  (12.0%)   and  by  Alberta  (10.4%)  (see  Table  4).

When  comparing  the  low-skilled  population  within  each  province  or  combination  of   provinces  according  to  immigration  status,  the  Atlantic  Provinces  (as  a  group)  have  the   highest  proportion  of  Canadian-born  low-skilled  workers  (97.3%);  the  remaining  2.7%   are  foreign  born  (IMM  and  NPRs)  low-skilled  workers.  The  Atlantic  provinces  are   followed  by  Quebec  with  88%  CB,  11.5%  IMM  and  0.6%  NPRs.  Ontario  and  British   152  
     

Columbia  have  somewhat  similar  proportions  of  CB,  IMM  and  NPRs  (approximately   66%  CB,  32%  IMM  and  1%  NPRs).  Together,  Manitoba  and  Saskatchewan  have  79%   CB,  20%  IMM  and  1%  NPRs  (see  Table  5).

The  proportion  of  NPRs  among  all  low-skilled  workers  for  the  whole  Canadian  

workforce  (0.9%)  indicates  that  low-skilled  NPRs  represent  a  very  small  proportion  of   the  entire  low-skilled  labour  force  (less  than  1%).  CB  makes  up  76.3%  of  the  low-skilled   labour  force  and  IMM  represent  22.8%.      5.4.3.  Sex:  NPR  low-skilled  workers  have  a  higher  representation  of  women   compared  to  IMM  or  CB.  Canada's  low-skilled  labour  force  is  predominantly  female   (57%).  The  greatest  proportion  of  women  is  found  among  the  NPRs  (60%),  the  second   greatest  among  the  IMM  (58%)  and  the  third  greatest  among  the  CB  (56%)  (see  Figure   7).  This  predominance  of  women  is  driven  primarily  by  occupations  in  the  retail  and   service  industries.  Table  6  presents  the  share  of  both  females  and  males  according  to   153  
     

occupation.  29%  of  low-skilled  Canadian-born  female  workers  are  concentrated  in  the   top  three  occupations  in  this  population:  occupations  related  to  sales,  customer  care   and  retail.  22%  of  low-skilled  female  immigrant  workers  are  concentrated  in  the  top   three  occupations  for  this  population:  occupations  related  to  retail,  cleaning  and  nurses- aids.  In  contrast  with  these  relatively  moderate  levels  of  concentration,  62%  of  low- skilled  female  NPRs  work  in  one  of  the  top  three  occupations  for  this  population

Almost  half  of  all  NPR  female  low-skilled  workers  are  concentrated  in  a  single  

occupation:  6474  -Babysitters  and  Nannies.  This  occupation  is  followed  in  popularity  by   6471  -  Visiting  Homemakers,  housekeepers  and  related  occupations  and  then  by  6661  -   Light  Duty  Cleaners.  In  contrast  with  their  female  counterparts,  male  low-skilled   Canadian-born  workers  are  distributed  in  more  diverse  types  of  occupations,  including   6421  -  Retail  salespersons;  7452  -  Material  handlers;  and,  6663  -  Janitors,  caretakers   and  building  superintendents.  Male  low-skilled  IMM  and  NPRs  also  tend  to  gravitate   towards  these  occupations.     154

However,  NPRs'  major  presence  is  in  occupations  in  the  agricultural  sector,   including  8431-General  farm  workers  and  8432-Nursery  and  greenhouse  workers.  The   three  low-skilled  male  populations  (Canadian-born,  immigrants  and  Non-Permanent   Residents)  exhibit  somewhat  similar  percentages  of  concentration  in  their  top  three   occupations  (32%,  26%  and  31%,  respectively).      5.4.4.  Country  of  birth  (COB):  NPR  low-skilled  workers'  COB  concentrate   around  five  countries.  One  of  them,  the  Philippines,  has  a  very  high  concentration   (1  in  3  NPRs).  As  Table  7  indicates,  the  presence  of  low-skilled  workers  in  Canada   according  to  country  of  birth  reflects  three  main  characteristics:  1)  most  foreign-born   low-skilled  workers  in  Canada  (including  IMM  and  NPRs)  come  from  the  same  top   source  countries  as  permanent  residents  (i.e.  India,  Philippines  and  China);  2)  NPR's   countries  of  birth  reflect  specific  TFW  agreements  that  Canada  has  made  with  other   countries  (i.e.  Mexico  and  Caribbean  countries  for  SAWPs)  as  well  as  the  absorption  of   labour  coming  from  traditionally  labour-exporter  countries  (the  Philippines  for  LICs);  and   3)  some  countries  of  birth  reflect  traditional  nationalities  linked  to  specific  occupations   (there  is,  for  example,  a  strong  link  between  the  Philippines  and  child/senior  care  and   Mexico  and  agriculture).      In  this  research,  the  proportions  of  low-skilled  workers  according  to  country  of  

birth  follow  specific  selection  criteria.  Only  those  who  declared  "Canada"  as  their   country  of  birth  and  "non-immigrant"  as  their  immigration  status  were  considered  as   Canadian-born.  To  avoid  double  counting,  in  this  section  (COB),  the  research  excluded   those  born  in  Canada  with  other  nationalities  (i.e.  dual-citizens).  Table  7  presents  the  

156  

     

top  20  countries  of  low-skilled  immigrant  and  NPR  workers.

It  is  also  illuminating  to  compare  the  concentration  of  NPRs  with  that  of  the  

immigrant  population.  Even  if  the  proportions  are  similar,  concentration  seems  to  be  a   bit  higher  for  NPRs.  The  Philippines  and  Mexico  account  for  38.2%  of  all  NPRs  in  this   study.  The  Philippines  alone  represents  30%  of  all  NPRs.  India,  China,  Mexico  and  the   United  Kingdom  are  also  among  the  top  countries  of  birth  of  low-skilled  immigrants  and   low-skilled  NPRs  in  Canada.      157  
     

Summary        Temporary  low-skilled  foreign  labour  has  become  a  way  of  exploiting  accessible  

and  inexpensive  labour  from  developing  countries  and  many  TFWs  have  documented   exploitative  experiences  during  their  time  in  Canada  (Faraday,  2012a;  2016).        Employers  in  Canada  have  four  streams  to  access  temporary  foreign  low-skilled  

labour.  Some  of  these  streams  have  been  either  recently  modified  (Live-in  Caregiver   Program)  or  recently  added  (Agricultural  Stream  and  Low-Wage  Stream).  While  the  LIC   program  is  the  only  program  to  offer  a  pathway  to  permanent  residence,  recent  changes   to  the  program  have  significantly  restricted  access  to  permanent  residency  and,  by   extension,  to  citizenship  (Faraday,  2016).      Among  all  low-skilled  workers  in  full-time  jobs,  the  greatest  concentration  is  in  the  

manufacturing  and  retail  trade  industry  sectors.  More  specifically,  low-skilled  workers   have  the  largest  representation  in  occupation  NOC  6421  -  Retail  Salespersons  and   sales  clerks  (approximately  260  000)  and  occupation  NOC  7411  -  Truck  Drivers   (approximately  178  000).  While  6421-Retail  and  Sales  Persons  is  the  top  occupation   among  both  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  low-skilled  workers,  occupation  NOC-6474   Babysitters  and  Nannies  and  parents'  helpers  is  the  top  occupation  among  NPRs.  The   top  20  occupations  in  the  NPR  population  represent  75%  of  the  total  of  NPRs  and  the   top  three  37.6%,  indicating  a  higher  concentration  of  NPRs  in  fewer  occupations  vis-a- vis  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  workers.        Most  low-skilled  NPRs  are  concentrated  in  Ontario.  There  is  a  higher  proportion  

of  female  to  male  low-skilled  workers  among  NPRs  than  among  CB  and  IMM.  There  is  a   particularly  high  concentration  of  female  NPRs  in  caregiving  occupations  and  of  male  

158  

     

NPRs  in  agricultural  occupations.  Mexico  and  the  Philippines  are  the  countries  of  origin   for  the  highest  concentration  of  NPRs  (38%).  The  Philippines  alone  takes  about  30%  of   the  share,  that  is,  nearly  one  in  three  low-skilled  NPRs  is  from  the  Philippines.        Having  provided  a  demographic  profile  of  all  low-skilled  workers  in  Canada,  the  

following  chapter  enhances  our  understanding  of  this  demographic  by  presenting  the   outcomes  of  the  wage  analysis  (concentration  of  wages  via  the  quartile  analysis  and   wage  differences  via  the  cross-tabulation  analysis).

Chapter  Six:  Wages  and  Differences  in  Citizenship  Status     by  Occupation  and  Industry      In  this  chapter,  I  introduce  the  key  focus  of  this  dissertation,  an  exploration  of  the  

tangible  labour  market  effects  of  lack  of  citizenship  on  low-skilled  workers.  To  evaluate   citizenship's  impact  on  wages,  I  framed  the  analysis  in  three  citizenship  groups:   Canadian-born  (CB),  Immigrants  -  including  permanent  residents  (IMM)  and  Non- Permanent  Residents  (NPRs).  In  this  chapter,  I  present  my  findings  on  wages  in  three   dimensions;  1)  absolute  average  hourly  wages  for  all  three  of  the  above  categories;  2)   the  range  of  wages  earned  by  workers  in  each  occupation;  3)  and  NPRs  wage   differences  (compared  to  CB  and  IMM).  These  analyses  are  done  in  a  range  of  industry   sectors  and  low-skilled  occupations  as  they  play  out  in  the  three  groups  I  identified.      This  chapter  presents  results  and  does  not  include  an  analysis  of  outcomes  (i.e.  

an  explanation  of  wage  differences),  something  that  will  be  covered  in  chapter  nine.  The   sections  are  further  subdivided  in  categories  and  subcategories  to  help  the  reader   navigate  through  the  specifics  in  each  section64   Recall  from  chapter  four  that:  1)  the  absolute  and  relative  wage  analysis  at  the   industry  sector  level  includes  13  industry  sectors;  2)  the  NPRs'  absolute  wage  analysis,   43  occupations;  3)  the  concentration  of  wages  analysis  at  the  occupation  level,  20   occupations;  and,  4)  the  NPRs'  relative  wage  analysis  at  the  occupation  level  (NPR   compared  to  CB  and  IMM),  35  occupations.  All  these  numbers  follow  selection  criteria   that  consider  number  of  counts  and  tests  for  means  comparison65.  Each  of  the  four

  This  is  especially  helpful  in  quantitative  analysis.     That  is,  it  includes  results  with  at  least  90  counts  in  the  weighted  sample  and  a  Bonferroni  test  result   between  0  and  5%  (Bonferroni  tests  evaluate  comparability  of  mean  wages).  The  number  90  is  chosen   because  it  is  a  large  enough  sample  to  ensure  no  violation  of  privacy  restrictions.  It  is  also  important  to

types  had  a  process  of  selection  of  occupations66.     Key  findings  demonstrate  that  non-access  to  citizenship  among  NPRs  negatively   impacts  both  their  relative  and  their  absolute  wages  in  the  following  way:  1)  Among  low- skilled  NPRs,  two  industry  sectors  (out  of  13  analyzed)  exhibited  very  low  absolute   wages.  Additionally,  low-skilled  NPRs  earned  lower  wages  than  the  CB  and  IMM  in  11  of   the  13  industry  sectors  analyzed.  In  the  remaining  two,  NPRs  earned  higher  wages  than   the  CB  and  IMM.  2)  Just  over  half  of  all  NPRs  (52%)  work  in  only  7  occupations  which   exhibit  high  concentration  of  NPRs  in  low  wages;  12  occupation  have  a  high   concentration  around  high  wages  (they  represent  30%  of  all  NPRs).  3)  The  lowest   absolute  wages  were  among  babysitters  and  nannies  (not  counting  room  and  board)   followed  by  low-skilled  workers  in  agriculture.  4)  Of  the  35  occupations  analyzed,  in  31   NPRs  earn  less  than  CB  and/or  IMM.  In  the  remaining  4  occupations,  NPR  relative   wages  exhibited  positive  differences  (NPRs  earning  more  than  CB  and  IMM).  This   demonstrates  that  NPRs  had  lower  wages  than  immigrants  and  Canadian-born  workers   in  about  89%  of  the  35  occupations  analyzed.  In  only  4  occupations  NPRs  had  higher   wages  than  the  Canadian-born  and  Immigrant  populations.         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
have  a  large  enough  sample  to  allow  for  comparisons  between  populations  (NPRs-CB  and  NPRs- IMM).  This  is  especially  relevant  among  NPRs  because  the  number  of  low-skilled  NPRs  is  in  most  cases   significantly  lower  than  the  number  of  Canadian-born  or  immigrant  workers.  The  analysis  must  be  done   among  samples  with  a  relevant  number  of  observations.  NPRs  are  chosen  as  the  reference  group,   because  the  end  goal  is  to  evaluate  their  wages  against  the  wages  of  those  who  have  access  to   citizenship  (CB  and  IMM).   66   Recall  from  chapter  four  that  1)  for  the  industry  sector  level  analysis,  the  original  number  of  21  industry   sectors  was  reduced  to  13  by  using  only  cases  with  a  reliable  number  of  counts  in  the  NPR  population   (per  industry  sector)  and  with  a  statistically  significant  Bonferroni  test;  2)  Regarding  absolute  wage   analysis  at  the  occupation  level,  the  total  of  98  low-skilled  occupations  identified  was  reduced  to  43  also   by  using  only  cases  with  a  reliable  number  of  counts.  The  outcomes  of  this  section  focus  on  the  top  20   occupations  with  the  highest  number  of  NPRs;  3)  For  the  concentration  of  wages  analysis  (quartile   analysis),  of  the  43  occupations  with  a  reliable  number  of  counts,  also  the  top  20  occupations  were   chosen;  4)  For  the  NPR  relative  wage  analysis  (NPR-CB  and  NPR-IMM),  the  43  occupations  chosen,   were  reduced  to  35  after  applying  Bonferroni  test.  Only  occupations  that  passed  the  test  were  included.

6.1.  Industry  Sector  Analysis  (Absolute  and  Relative  Wages)      This  section  is  the  introduction  to  the  heart  of  this  dissertation's  focal  question,  

the  effect  of  lack  of  citizenship  on  wages  of  NPRs.  An  industry  sector  level  analysis   provides  a  macroeconomic  perspective  on  the  differences  in  wages,  which  is  the  point   of  departure  for  this  dissertation.  This  level  of  analysis  will  bring  to  the  forefront   differences  among  low-skilled  workers  working  in  sectors  that  rely  most  on  low-skilled   temporary  foreign  labour.  It  will  provide  a  macroeconomic  perspective  on  the  labour   market  outcomes  of  low-skilled  NPRs  in  Canada.  Having  a  sound  grasp  of  the  wages  of   low-skilled  workers  in  each  industry  sector  provides  information  on  how  to  evaluate  low- skilled  labour  gaps  in  these  sectors  at  the  time  of  the  census.        The  wage-differences  analysis  will  serve  as  a  means  to  analyze  how  wages  

compare  between  populations.  Wage  differences  are  calculated  using  the  cross- tabulation  analysis  explained  in  chapter  four.  
  

  

6.1.1.  Absolute  wages  of  NPRs  by  industry  sector.  Figure  8  shows  an  

industry-sector  distribution  of  wages  for  low-skilled  workers  in  Canada  sorted  from  high   to  low  (with  NPRs  as  the  reference).  It  indicates  that  NPR  wages  by  industry  sector  vary   from  about  $10.10/hour  to  $19.10/hour.  Low-skilled  NPRs  working  in  the  Agriculture,   forestry,  fishing  and  hunting  industry  sector  earn  the  lowest  wages  (an  average  of   $10.10/hour).  The  second  industry  sector  includes  workers  in  the  'Other  Services'  sector   (except  public  administration),  averaging  approximately  $10.20/  hour.  This  is  a   composite  service  sector  and  includes  caregiving  occupations,  which  comprise  the   largest  number  of  NPRs.  These  results  seem  rather  high.  As  will  be  explained,  high  

162  

     

average  wages  are  the  consequence  of  high  wage  dispersion67.

Wage  dispersion  (high  standard  deviation)  skews  industry  sector  outcomes.  

Instances  of  high  wages  cause  high  dispersion.  This  is  an  important  consideration  when   analyzing  wages  because  even  a  few  cases  of  high  wages  can  inflate  the  mean.  While   wage  dispersion  in  this  analysis  may  be  the  result  of  differences  in  actual  skill  level  or

  Wage  dispersion  refers  to  how  wages  are  spread  out  in  a  population.  It  refers  to  significant  differences   in  wages  even  though  all  work  is  related  to  the  same  occupation.   68   The  Other  Services  (Except  Public  Administration)  category  has  four  bars  unlike  three  for  others   because  of  wage  differences  among  Babysitters,  Nannies  and  Parents'  Helpers.  They  are  grouped  under   Other  Services  industry  sector  category.  The  bright  red  bar  represents  the  average  wage  for  the  industry   sector  including  their  compensation  represented  in  room  and  board.  The  green  one  does  not  include   room  and  board.  Babysitters,  Nannies  and  Parents'  Helpers  represent  83%  of  all  NPRs  in  this  industry   sector.  Accounting  for  room  and  board  (a  private  room)  NPRs  in  this  category  represents  additional   earnings  of  about  $2/hour.

seniority,  other  intrinsic  sources  of  wage  dispersion  (i.e.  factors  that  are  introduced   either  by  the  government  or  the  local  labour  market)  can  be  identified.  Two  main   sources  of  wage  dispersion  at  the  industry  sector  analysis  were  identified:  wage   dispersions  within  sectors  and  wage  dispersion  across  sectors.        First,  wage  dispersion  within  sectors  has  different  possible  sources:  a)  Each  

industry  sector  has  a  broad  range  of  wages.  This  is  linked  to  the  fact  that  each  industry   clusters  information  from  occupations  and  each  occupation  clusters  a  broad  range  of   jobs,  each  with  a  broad  range  of  wages.  b)  While  Figure  8  introduces  the  analysis  of  the   statistics  of  low-skilled  wages  in  Canada,  a  sector  level  representation  blurs  differences   not  only  in  the  wages,  but  also  in  labour  conditions  of  diverse  industries  and   occupations.  Some  occupations  included  in  each  sector,  are  likely  to  pay  some  workers   minimum  wage,  which  c)  varies  from  province  to  province.  In  short,  there  are  several   sources  of  wage  dispersion  for  each  industry  sector.        Second,  wage  dispersion  is  also  present  across  sectors,  which  is  linked  to  the  

nature  of  each  sector.  Each  sector  experiences  fluctuations  linked  to  changes  in  the   regional  and  national  economy  as  well  as  to  changes  specific  to  the  sector,  all  of  which   are  reflected  in  the  NAICS69  system  (Hiles,  2001;  Walker  and  Murphy,  2001).        Performing  a  type  of  analysis  that  considers  how  wages  are  distributed  within  

each  population  (NPR,  CB  and  IMM)  and  occupation  addresses  the  gaps  linked  to  wage   dispersion.  This  will  be  explored  later  in  this  chapter.  Following,  I  deepen  the  analysis   on  the  effects  of  lack  of  citizenship  on  wages.  The  following  section  introduces  the   outcomes  of  a  cross-tabulation  analysis  at  the  industry  level.  It  includes  the  relative   wages  of  NPRs  compared  to  the  CB  and  IMM.

6.1.2.  Relative  wages  of  NPRs  (Compared  to  CB  and  IMM)  by  Industry  

Sector.  Regarding  Wage  differences  by  industry  sector,  Figure  9  presents  the   statistically  significant  wage  differences  by  immigration  category  and  industry  sectors.   To  ensure  comparability  of  means  in  the  mean  differences  analysis,  a  Post-Hoc  test   (Bonferroni  test)  was  performed  for  all  differences.  Comparing  the  wages  of  low-skilled   workers  by  immigration  status  at  the  industry  sector  level  reveals  patterns  among  those   with  an  NPR  immigration  status  in  relation  to  those  with  a  permanent  status  (Canadian- born,  naturalized  immigrants  and  permanent  residents).

The  figure  shows  that  the  categories  Health  Care  and  Social  Assistance,  Other  

165  

     

services  (except  public  administration),  and  Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing  and  Hunting,   exhibit  the  highest  negative  differences  in  wages  for  low-skilled  NPRs  compared  to  their   Canadian-born  and  immigrant  counterparts.        NPRs  in  the  Health  Care  and  Social  Assistance  industry  sector  earn  37%  less  

than  the  Canadian-born  and  36%  less  than  the  immigrant  population.  These  results   begin  to  reinforce  what  the  literature  claims,  namely,  that  in  most  industry  sectors  the   wage  of  low-skilled  workers  without  citizenship  (NPRs)  is  lower  than  that  of  those  with   access  to  citizenship  (CB  and  IMM).      The  Other  Services  category  exhibits  31%  and  29%  negative  differences  

between  NPRs  and  IMM  and  CB,  respectively.  Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing  and   Hunting  follows  with  27%  and  29%  less  wage  for  NPRs  compared  to  the  IMM  and  CB,   respectively.  Manufacturing  also  exhibits  negative  differences.  According  to  Figure  9,   NPRs  earn  26%  and  22%  less  than  CB  and  IMM,  respectively.  Note  that  the  red  bar   missing  in  this  figure  (in  the  Transportation  and  Warehousing  Sector)  corresponds  to  a   statistically  non-significant  value  (see  Bonferroni  test  in  chapter  four).  Absent  bars  in  all   figures  will  correspond  to  statistically  non-significant  values.      NPRs  in  some  industry  sectors  exhibit  higher  wages  than  CB  and  IMM  (i.e.  

Accommodation  and  food  services  -AFS).  Given  that  industry  sectors  are  comprised  of   different  occupations,  looking  at  the  different  occupations  may  help  to  evaluate  the   veracity  of  this.  Assuming  that  NPRs  in  certain  occupations  earn  more  than  CB  and   IMM,  it  is  possible  that  these  wages  indicate  genuine  gaps  in  the  labour  market  in  these   specific  sectors.  However,  as  explained  above,  wage  dispersion  affects  our  reading  of   wages.    

166  

     

  

Although  these  statistics  offer  insight  into  the  wage  differences  among  the  low-

skilled  population,  analysis  at  the  level  of  the  industry  sector,  which  blurs  the  diversity  of   low-skilled  occupations  in  each  industry  sector,  provides  a  somewhat  fuzzy  picture.   Occupations  in  various  sectors  demand  specific  skills,  which  may  challenge  the  low- skilled  designation  of  these  occupations  and  may  affect  wage  compensation.  This  great   diversity  may  also  lead  to  even  greater  wage  dispersion  within  the  sectors  themselves.   Though  relevant,  this  level  of  analysis  nevertheless  falls  also  short  because  each   industry  sector  clusters  together  a  diverse  number  of  occupational  groups,  which   represents  a  significant  source  of  wage  dispersion.  Therefore,  a  more  granular  analysis   is  also  required.  More  specifically,  an  occupation  level  analysis  helps  reduce  the  effects   of  wage  dispersion  and  provides  more  detailed  information  about  wage  discrepancies   among  low-skilled  workers.      6.2.  Occupation  Level  Analysis  -  Absolute  Wages  of  NPRs  by  Occupation      With  NPRs  wages  ordered  lowest  to  highest,  Figure  10A  shows  a  summary  of  

the  wages  of  the  top  20  low-skilled  occupations  (out  of  the  43  analyzed  ­  see  Appendix   10A  for  wages  of  NPRs,  CB  and  IMM  in  all  43  occupations).  The  chart  includes   occupations  with  the  highest  number  of  NPRs70;  wages  are  organized  top  to  bottom   among  NPRs.  Of  the  43  occupations  analyzed,  Babysitters,  nannies  and  parents'   helpers  earn  the  lowest  wages  (not  accounting  for  room  and  board),  $8.10/hour.  The   wages  of  NPR  babysitters  and  nannies'  do  not  reflect  additional  compensation  (room   and  board)  received  by  live-in  caregivers.  In  2012,  the  Ontario  government  stipulated  
                                                                                                 
70

  The  occupations  in  the  chart  also  allowed  a  quartile  analysis,  which  was  explained  in  detail  in  chapter   four  and  is  used  in  the  next  section  of  this  chapter.

that  employers  could  deduct  $85.25  weekly  from  wage  payment  to  live-in-caregivers  for   room  and  board  in  a  private  room  and  $53.55  weekly  in  a  non-private  room  (Faraday,   2012a).  In  October  of  2016  the  amount  remained  the  same  (Ontario  Ministry  of  Labour,   2016).  The  2006  census  shows  an  average  of  41.17  hours  of  work  for  babysitters  and   nannies.71  Hence  room  and  board  would  represent  an  additional  compensation  of  about   $2.07/hour  in  the  case  of  a  private  room  (or  $85.25  per  week/41.17  hours  per  week)   and  $1.30/hour  in  the  case  of  a  non-private  room  (or  $53.55  per  week/41.17  hours  per   week).      As  already  mentioned,  the  average  wage  for  NPR  babysitters  and  nannies  

reported  in  the  2006  census  was  $8.10/hour.  The  great  majority  of  NPRs  doing  this  job,   do  so  as  live-in-caregivers.  Therefore,  calculating  the  wage  of  NPRs  in  this  occupation   should  add  the  value  of  room  and  board  provided  for  the  employer.  This  would  raise   their  'real'  hourly  wage  to  either  $9.40/hour  (8.10+1.30)  in  the  case  of  a  non-private   private  room  or  $10.17/hour  (8.10+2.07)  in  the  case  of  a  private  room.  Typically,  a   private  room  is  provided  for  accommodation.  Accordingly,  the  narrative  and  occupation- related  figures  to  follow  will  refer  to  the  hourly  wage  rate  in  two  modalities:  census   derived  wage/census  derived  wage  +  private  room  and  board  increment.  

                                                                                                 
71

  This  number  of  hours  is  used  for  calculation  purposes.  However,  it  is  important  to  note  that  live-in   caregivers  have  reported  working  unreported  or  under-reported  hours  (Bakan  &  Stasiulis,  2003,  as  cited   in  Cheung,  2006).

With  room  and  board,  babysitters  and  nannies'  average  wage  ($10.17/hour)  is  no  

longer  the  lowest72,  thus,  NPR  wages  range  from  $9.42/hour  for  8432  -    Nursery  and   greenhouse  workers73  to  $20.92/hour  for  7411-Truck  Drivers.  Given  that  minimum  wage   at  the  time  of  the  2006  Census  in  provinces  were  around  $7.50/hour  (e.g.  in  Ontario   was  $7.43/hour),  as  with  the  industry  sector  analysis  these  values  seem  rather  high.  As   with  industry  sectors,  high  mean  wages  by  occupation  are  also  associated  to  high  wage   dispersion.  Sources  of  wage  dispersion  at  the  occupation  level  include:  1)  NOC  4   occupations  group  together  significantly  diverse  jobs;  and  that  2)  the  wages  of  most   low-skilled  occupations  are  close  to  the  minimum  wage,  which  varies  from  province  to   province.  A  more  detailed  explanation  of  each  of  these  causes  of  wage  dispersion  is   included  in  appendix  eight.  Extrinsic  factors  (i.e.  factors  less  under  the  control  of  the   government  or  the  local  labour  market),  such  as  changes  in  oil  prices,  are  not   accounted  for  in  this  research.  In  view  of  these  possible  sources  of  wage  dispersion,   mean  wages  alone  do  not  provide  a  complete  picture,  especially  in  low-paying  jobs,   where  many  sources  of  variation  outside  the  domain  of  local  labour  markets  come  into   play.      Assessing  the  degree  of  dispersion  of  the  sample  (or  the  population)  is  extremely  

important  since  a  significantly  high  dispersion  translates  into  high  mean  wages.  In  this   analysis,  dispersion  is  measured  through  the  Standard  Deviation  (),  which  provides   information  on  how  spread  out  the  data  is.        Since  wages  generally  tend  to  have  high  levels  of  dispersion  (high  standard

  Although  not  the  lowest,  accounting  for  room  and  board  makes  babysitters  and  nannies'  average  wage   the  sixth  lowest  of  all  occupations.   73   Note  that  another  agricultural  occupation  follows  as  the  second  lowest  (8611-Harvesting  Labourers  with   $9.50/hour)

deviation),  the  mean  wage  provides  a  partial  view  of  wages  among  low-skilled  workers.   It  is  accordingly  imperative  to  complement  the  analysis  of  wage  differences  (NPR-CB   and  NPR-IMM),  which  will  be  presented  later  in  this  chapter)  with  a  quartiles  analysis.   When  high  dispersion  is  present,  a  quartile  analysis  helps  identify  the  concentration  of   wages.  As  will  be  shown,  although  some  values  are  significantly  high  (which  results  in   high  means),  most  of  the  values  are  concentrated  in  the  first  three  quartiles  (low  wage   quartiles).      6.3.  Assessing  Wage  Dispersion  (Broad  Wage  Range)  in  Absolute  Wages  -   Quartile  Analysis      Why  is  a  quartile  analysis  important?  What  does  it  reveal?  How  does  it  reveal?  A  

quartile  analysis  is  important  because  it  reveals  the  distribution  of  workers'  wages  in   each  occupation.  This  is  important  to  identify  whether  there  are  concentrations  within   occupations  of  workers  at  a  low  end  or  a  high  end,  of  reported  earnings  for  that   occupation.  Undertaking  quartile  analysis  entails  two  stages:  first,  is  dividing  the  full   range  of  reported  wages  into  four  equal  quartiles  of  reported  data.  The  second  stage,  is   distributing  the  total  number  of  workers  in  an  occupation  into  those  wage  quartiles  to   identifying  any  clustering.  Recall,  the  quartile  divides  wage  ranges  in  equal  parts  and   not  number  of  workers  in  equal  parts.        Once  we  stablished  wage  quartiles,  we  can  then  identify  how  many  people  are  

included  in  each  quartile;  it  helps  to  see  whether  many  people  concentrate  in  either  low- wage  or  high-wage  quartiles.

   Thus,  this  section  serves  the  purpose  of  examining  the  detail  within  the  wage  ranges   in  the  occupations  analyzed.  It  is  important  for  the  whole  analysis  because  it  helps   identify  the  pockets  of  concentration  of  wages  (high  and  low)  in  the  low-skilled   occupations  analyzed.  Table  8  presents  the  mean  wages  per  quartile  and  occupation  for   the  NPR  populations  (For  the  CB  and  IMM  population  distribution  by  quartiles  see   Appendices  10  B  and  10  C).  The  table  also  present  the  wages  and  proportions  of  the   groups  for  the  first  two  and  three  quartiles.  They  present  the  share  in  each  quartile  and   the  average  wage  for  each  quartile  (for  the  top  20  occupations  employing  NPRs,  the   main  target  group).  Finally,  they  include  the  share  and  wages  of  grouping  together  the   first  two  and  the  first  three  quartiles  for  NPRs,  CB  and  IMM,  respectively.  Altogether,   there  is  considerable  data  in  this  table  (and  on  those  in  the  appendices),  which,  in  turn,   reflects  the  significance  of  the  data  produced  by  this  research.   Table  8  includes  information  on  the  distribution  of  the  population  in  each  occupation   and  quartile  for  NPRs.  The  first  column  the  table  lists  the  type  of  occupation.  The   sections  to  the  right  include  the  distribution  by  quartile  (columns  Q1,  Q2,  Q3  and  Q4)   and  the  combination  of  quartiles  (Q1+Q2)  and  (Q1+Q2+Q3);  the  average  wage  by   quartile  ($/hour  for  Q1,  Q2,  Q3  and  Q4);  and  the  average  wages  for  the  combined   quartiles  (Q1+Q2)  and  (Q1+Q2+Q3).  This  information  helps  to  see  the  actual   concentration  of  workers  around  low  wages  and  the  average  wage  in  the  merged  lower   quartiles.  For  example,  babysitters  and  nannies  are  distributed  in  the  following  way:   39%  in  the  first  quartile,  38%  in  the  second  quartile;  for  a  total  of  77%  concentrated  in   the  combined  quartiles  Q1  and  Q2  (Q1+Q2);  and  17%  in  the  third  quartile.  If  we  merge   the  first  three  quartiles  (Q1+Q2+Q3),  the  share  rises  to  94%.  The  fourth  quartile  has   173  
     

only  6%  of  all  babysitters  and  nannies.  The  average  wage  of  those  in  the  first  quartile  is   $5.01/hour;  in  the  second  quartile  $8.03/hour.  The  average  wage  for  the  combined  Q1   and  Q2  (Q1+Q2)  is  $6.52/hour.  The  average  for  those  in  the  third  quartile  is  $10.20/hour   and  for  the  first  three  quartiles  (Q1+Q2+Q3)  is  $7.20/hour.  The  average  wage  for  those   in  the  fourth  quartile74  is  $22.30/hour.  The  following  three  subsections  introduce  relevant   outcomes  extracted  from  the  quartile  analysis  in  table  8.           6.3.1.  NPR  cases  with  high  concentration  in  the  first  three  quartiles.    Among  

NPRs,  seven  occupations  stand  out  as  having  a  high  concentration  of  cases  in  the  first   three  quartiles,  which  refer  to  occupations  with  people  earning  very  low  wages;  they   represent  52%  of  all  low-skilled.  Table  8  shows  that  for  the  NPR  population,  of  the  top   20  occupations,  7  have  more  than  74%  of  the  population  in  the  first  three  quartiles75.   This  indicates  that  a  significant  portion  of  workers  in  these  occupations  are   concentrated  in  the  lowest  three  quartiles,  which  means  they  earn  low  wages.  These   occupations  are:     ·   6474-Babysitters,  nannies  and  parents'  helpers;76     ·   8431-General  farm  workers;     ·   8432-Nursery  and  greenhouse  workers;     ·   6471-Visiting  homemakers,  housekeepers  and  related  occupations;   ·   6641-Food  counter  attendants,  kitchen  helpers  and  related  occupations;  
                                                                                                 
74

  Note  that  averages  in  the  fourth  quartile  all  exhibit  significantly  high  dispersion  (i.e.  significantly  high   standard  deviation).  This  indicates  that  wage  values  in  this  quartile  are  dispersed.   75   Recall  that  quartiles  are  wage-range  based  and  NOT  population-range  based.  So,  74%  represents  a   high  proportion  of  low-skilled  workers  that  coincidentally  is  close  to  75%.  It  is  not  expected  equal   proportion  of  populations  in  each  quartile.   76   As  explained  its  inclusion  here  does  not  account  for  room  and  board.  

174  

     

·   6611-Cashiers;  and     ·   8611-Harvesting  labourers      As  previously  mentioned,  77%  of  workers  in  occupation  6474-Babysitters,  

nannies  and  parents'  helpers  concentrate  in  the  first  two  quartiles,  with  an  average   wage  for  the  two  quartiles  combined  of  $6.52/hour  (see  Table  8)  or  $8.59/hour  including   room  and  board  (private  room).  For  the  first  three  quartiles  combined,  the  average  rises   to  $9.25/  if  including  room  and  board  (private  room).  The  average  wage  for  the  six   occupations  (in  the  first  three  quartiles  combined  in  each  occupation  and  excluding   babysitters  and  nannies)  is  $7.73/hour  per  hour  which  is  close  to  the  average  minimum   wage  in  2005  in  Canada  ($7.15/hour).  This  begins  to  show  a  pattern:  occupations  in   caregiving  and  agriculture  are  concentrated  around  low  wages.77      These  results  are  encapsulated  in  the  total  for  all  low-skilled  occupations.  Table  8  

shows  that  the  Total  Average  Wage  for  all  occupations  in  the  first  three  quartiles  (which   includes  72%  of  all  low-skilled  NPRs)  was  $7.49/hour,  which  is  close  to  provincial   minimum  wages  in  2005  (ex.  in  Ontario  it  was  $7.43/hour).           6.3.2.  NPR  cases  with  high  concentration  in  the  fourth  quartile.  Among  

NPRs,  12  of  the  remaining  13  occupations78  have  a  high  concentration  of  cases  in  the   fourth  quartile  (very  high  wages);  in  these  12  occupations,  between  31%  and  54%  of  all   workers  (per  occupation)  concentrate  in  the  fourth  quartile;  and  all  NPRs  in  these  12   occupations  represent  30%  of  all  NPRs.    
                                                                                                 
77 78

  Other  occupations  with  low  wages  are  Food  Counter  Attendants  and  Cashiers.     th   Occupation  9451  -  Sewing  machine  operators  is  left  out  of  the  total  for  the  4   quartile  because  it  has   th fewer  than  90  counts  in  the  4   quartile.  Note  that  65%  of  the  workers  in  this  occupation  are  concentrated   in  the  first  three  quartiles  (see  Table  8).  

175  

     

  

As  Table  8  shows,  of  the  remaining  13  occupations  among  NPRs,  12  exhibit  a  

medium  to  high  concentration  in  the  fourth  quartile  (between  31%  and  54%  of  all  NPRs   in  each  occupation).  NPRs  in  these  12  occupations  represent  less  than  one  third  (30%)   of  all  NPRs  in  this  study.  This  means  that,  although  the  number  of  occupations  is  high   (12  of  the  top  20),  the  actual  number  of  people  is  low  (31%)  compared  to  the  number  of   people  in  low  wages  (52%).79  The  13  occupations  are:   ·   6421-Retail  salespersons  and  sales  clerks   ·   6661-Light  duty  cleaners   ·   1413-Nurse  aides,  orderlies  and  patient  service  associates   ·   7452-Material  handlers   ·   6663-Janitors,  caretakers  and  building  superintendents   ·   9619-Other  labourers  in  processing,  manufacturing  and  utilities   ·   1453-Customer  service,  information  and  related  clerks   ·   7411-Truck  Drivers   ·   6453-Food  and  beverage  servers   ·   9462-Industrial  butchers  and  meat  cutters,  poultry  preparers  and  related  workers   ·   7611-Construction  trades  helpers  and  labourers   ·   1431-Accounting  and  related  clerks   ·   9451-Sewing  machine  operators  (not  included  because  it  has  less  than  90  counts  in   the  4th  quartile)     
79

Of  the  12  occupations  with  more  than  90  counts  (9451-Sewing  machine  

                                                                                                 
  The  remaining  18%  corresponds  to  NPRs  in  occupation  9451  -  Sewing  machine  operators  plus  those   distributed  in  occupations  outside  the  top  20  occupations  for  NPRs.  These  occupations  had  a  very  small   number  of  NPRs  per  occupation  and  did  not  permit  a  quartile  analysis.

operators  excluded),  8  have  between  53%  and  69%  of  their  populations  in  the  first  three   quartiles.  This  still  reflects  an  important  degree  of  concentration  around  low  wages  even   though  they  have  a  high  wage  in  the  fourth  quartile.  Workers  with  wages  in  the  fourth   quartile  in  these  occupations  have  average  wages  ranging  from  $28.40/hour  (6661-   Light  duty  cleaners)  to  $33.80/hour  (7411-Truck  Drivers).  As  a  vivid  example  of  how  high   wages  can  increase  the  mean,  in  the  fourth  quartile,  NPRs  in  occupation  6611-Cashiers   earn  $41.90/hour  (the  highest  average  wage  in  the  fourth  quartile).  Yet  only  25%  of  all   NPRs  in  this  occupation  have  wages  in  this  quartile.  Referencing  data  from  the  2011   National  Household  Survey,80  Service  Canada  reports  that  44.9%  of  cashiers  earn   between  $20  000/year  and  $49  999/year  and  1.5%  of  cashiers  earn  above  $50  000/year   (Service  Canada,  2015).  Even  though  the  wages  cited  are  annual,  this  example  helps   illustrate  how  a  very  small  group  of  cashiers  with  very  high  wages  (1.5%  of  the   population  with  wages  above  $50  000/year)  can  significantly  alter  the  average  wage  for   the  fourth  quartile81.  Whatever  the  reason  for  this  increase,  it  is  striking  that  the   remaining  75%  of  cashiers  recorded  earning  an  average  of  $7.60/hour  (See  Table  8),  a   significantly  low  average  wage  (compared  with  the  average  of  those  in  the  last  quartile).   This  discrepancy  makes  this  occupation  a  good  candidate  for  future,  more  in-depth,   research.      Generally,  high  wages  in  the  fourth  quartile  may  also  relate  to  the  fact  that  some  

employees  are  paid  more  according  to  seniority  (ex.  seasonal  workers  coming  to

  As  explained  in  chapter  four,  Statistics  Canada  has  deemed  the  2011  NHS  reliable  at  the  occupation   level.   81   This  pattern  is  apparent  in  almost  all  occupations  analyzed  in  this  research.  Such  high  wages  may   correspond  with  people  who  were  recorded  in  the  census  who  were  paid  overtime  for  a  small  number  of   reported  hours  or  were  recorded  as  being  employed  but  were  perhaps  relatives  of  the  business  owners   (ex.  a  relative  brought  to  Canada  to  work  in  a  family  business  as  a  TFW).

Canada  every  year).82  The  fact  that  some  occupations  include  a  broad  range  of  jobs,   may  also  contribute  to  these  high  wages.  It  is  possible  for  people  to  earn  different   salaries  for  doing  different  jobs  in  the  same  occupation.  For  a  detailed  analysis  of  this   phenomenon  see  appendix  eight.  Although  instances  of  workers  earning  high  wages  in   the  fourth  quartile  distort  the  mean  for  its  corresponding  occupation,  they  are   nevertheless  still  part  of  the  population  and  need  to  be  included  since  outliers  have   already  been  withdrawn.  It  would  be  worth  further  examining  high  wages  (in  the  fourth   quartile)  in  all  low-skilled  occupations  in  future  research  work.     
   6.3.3.  NPR  cases  with  very  low  wages  in  the  first  quartile.  In  all  analyzed  

occupations,  the  average  wage  in  the  first  quartile  is  below  the  minimum  wage.   According  to  Table  8,  27%  of  all  NPR  cases  included  in  this  research,  all  located  in  the   first  quartile,  had  an  average  wage  of  $4.80/hour  (which  is  below  minimum  wage).        In  addition  to  cases  of  people  who  may  have  been  "lawfully"  paid  wages  below  

minimum  wage,  some  cases  of  low  recorded  wages  may  be  the  outcome  of  the  data   itself.  The  hourly  wage,  for  example,  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  2005  weekly  wage  by   the  number  of  hours  worked  during  the  week  prior  to  the  census,  which  in  some  cases   may  have  been  higher  than  usual,  making  the  wage  lower  than  usual.  While  it  is   important  to  identify  possible  reasons  for  incidents  of  low  recorded  wages,  the  overall   number  of  cases  is  small  and  are  all  part  of  the  first  quartile  and  wages  in  the  other   quartiles  are  more  likely  to  correspond  to  a  more  accurate  wage.  Even  if  the  mean   wages  in  the  first  quartile  correspond  to  disproportions  between  the  number  of  hours  
                                                                                                 
82

  The  census  does  not  trace  seniority  for  TFWs,  so  it  was  not  possible  to  include  this  consideration  in  the   analysis.  

178  

     

and  the  wage  received  in  2005,  they  nevertheless  need  to  be  included83.        In  summary,  as  the  table  show,  the  quartiles  analysis  is  imperative  since  it  unveils  

the  real  issue  of  many  low-skilled  workers'  wages  concentrated  around  low  wages  and   some  around  high  wages.  The  quartile  analysis  also  shows  that  the  average  wage  of   the  whole  population  per  occupation  does  not  provide  the  whole  truth  with  respect  to   wages.  Some  occupations  with  high  average  wages  have  a  significant  number  of   people  concentrated  in  low-wage  quartiles  (first  three).  Appendix  10D  gathers  a   summary  of  the  average  wages  per  quartile  in  the  three  immigration  categories.  It  is   important  to  note  that  the  quartile  analysis  revealed  a  significant  concentration  of  wages   around  low  values,  generally  around  minimum  wage  (see  Table  8)  primarily  in   occupations  in  caregiving  and  agriculture.  Nevertheless,  still  we  need  to  know  how   NPRs  fare  against  CB  and  IMM.  To  address  this,  it  is  worth  analyzing  wage  differences   of  NPRs  compared  top  CB  and  IMM84  in  the  occupations  themselves.  This  is  presented   in  the  following  section  on  relative  wages  of  NPRs  (compared  to  CB  and  IMM)  by   occupation.      6.4.  Relative  wages  of  NPRs  (compared  to  CB  and  IMM  or  NPR-CB  and  NPR-IMM)   by  Occupation      Comparing  the  wages  of  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  workers  with  those  of  the

  It  is  important  to  note  that  these  cases  are  most  evident  among  NPRs  (see  proportion  of  cases  in  the   first  quartile  in  Tables  8,  9,  10).  The  opposite  possible  outcome,  that  is,  that  very  high  reported  wages   linked  to  inaccuracies  in  calculation  are  most  likely  to  appear  in  the  fourth  quartile,  is  ruled  out  because  all   cases  included  in  this  study  report  working  30  or  more  hours  a  week.  There  are  no  cases  with  a  lower   number  of  hours  (see  selection  of  populations  in  chapter  four).  Therefore,  those  in  the  fourth  quartile  can   be  counted  as  genuine  cases  of  high  wages.  Accordingly,  the  wage  analysis  presented  in  this  chapter   includes  the  whole  population,  even  if  the  average  wages  per  occupation  appear  significantly  high.   84   Mean  wage  differences  in  this  research  distinguish  those  that  are  statistically  significant  from  those  that   are  not.  The  statistical  significance  comes  from  the  post  hoc  tests  explained  in  chapter  four.

Regarding  wage  differences,  Figure  10B  presents  statistically  significant  

differences  in  wages  between  the  Canadian-born  and  the  NPR  populations  (blue)  and   between  the  immigrant  and  the  NPR  populations  (red)  in  selected  occupations.  A  more   180  
     

detailed  comparison  of  NPR  wages  against  those  of  the  Canadian-born  population  and   the  immigrant  population  is  included  in  Appendix  10E.  The  analysis  shows  that,  of  the   35  occupations  analyzed,  31  had  negative  differences  and  4  had  positive  differences.   This  means  that  NPRs  had  lower  wages  than  immigrants  and  Canadian-born  workers  in   about  89%  of  the  occupations  analyzed.  In  only  4  occupations  NPRs  had  higher  wages   than  the  immigrant  and  Canadian-born  populations.      Negative  differences.  While  the  lowest  average  hourly  wages  were  among  

babysitters  &  nannies  and  agricultural  workers,  the  greatest  difference  in  average  hourly   wages  between  the  Canadian-born  and  the  NPR  populations  is  found  in  the  NOC-9482   Motor  Vehicle  Assemblers  occupation.  NPRs  earn  36%  less  than  Canadian  born   workers  in  this  occupation.  The  NOC  6471  -  Visiting  homemakers,  housekeepers  and   related  occupations,  exhibit  the  largest  average  hourly  wage  difference  between  the   immigrant  and  NPR  populations.  NPRs  in  this  occupation  earn  36%  less  than  the   immigrant  population.  This  data  supports  a  trend  already  identified  in  different  academic   articles:  in  most  low-skilled  occupations  NPRs  have  lower  wages  than  their  Canadian- born  and  immigrant  counterparts.  It  is  also  worth  noting  that  although  the  differences   between  NPRs  and  CB  and  between  NPRs  and  IMM  employed  as  babysitters  and   nannies  or  in  agriculture  are  not  the  greatest,  they  are  still  significant.  Not  accounting  for   compensation  for  room  and  board,  NPRs  working  in  occupation  6474-Babysitters  and   Nannies  earn  31%  less  than  CB  and  25%  less  than  IMM.  When  accounting  for  room   and  board  (with  a  private  room),  the  average  wage  raises  from  $8.10/hour  to   $10.17/hour,  which  reduces  the  wage  differences.  Nevertheless,  the  wage  difference   remains  negative  (i.e.  NPRs  earn  13%  less  than  CB  and  5%  less  than  IMM).  By  the  

181  

     

same  token,  NPRs  working  in  occupation  8434-Nursery  and  Greenhouse  Workers  earn   21%  less  than  CB  and  22%  less  than  IMM.  These  preliminary  results  suggest  that  most   NPRs  in  the  Canadian  labour  force  earn  lower  wages  than  Canadian-born  and   immigrant  workers,  which  will  be  further  confirmed  in  the  regression  analysis.      Positive  differences.  The  four  occupations  that  exhibit  positive  differences  (higher  

wages)  among  the  NPR  population  vis-à-vis  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  workers  are:   9451-Sewing  machine  operators;  6611-Cashiers;  7411-Truck  drivers;  and  8612- Landscaping  and  grounds  maintenance  labourers.  The  first  three  occupations  (9451,   6611  and  7411)  had  enough  cases  to  allow  a  quartile  analysis.  In  the  first  two   occupations  (9451  and  6611),  although  the  average  was  high,  most  cases  concentrated   in  the  first  three  quartiles  with  a  low  average  wage  (see  Table  8).  Wages  in  occupations   in  which  NPRs  earn  more  than  CB  and  IMM  correspond  most  likely  to  situations  in   which  there  is  a  concentration  of  a  few  cases  with  very  high  wages  in  the  fourth  quartile   (the  highest  one)  ­  see  Table  8.  For  example,  NPRs  in  occupation  6611-  Cashiers,   exhibit  higher  wages  than  CB  and  IMM.  Of  all  NPRs  in  Canada  working  in  this   occupation  (and  included  in  this  study),  only  25%  of  the  cases  are  concentrated  in  the   fourth  quartile,  but  their  average  wage  is  $41.90/hour.  As  previously  shown,  data  from   the  2011  National  Household  Survey  shows  more  than  40%  cashiers  earning  between   $20,000/year  and  $49,999/year  and  1.5%  of  cashiers  earning  above  $50,000/year.      For  7411-  Truck  Drivers,  on  the  contrary,  more  than  half  of  the  cases  (53%)  were  

concentrated  in  the  fourth  quartile.  This  indicates  that  there  is  a  genuinely  high  number   of  NPRs  earning  high  wages.  The  specific  case  of  truck  drivers  is  further  analyzed  in   chapter  nine.

Summary        Wages  of  low-skilled  NPRs  compared  to  those  of  CB  and  IMM,  provides  a  good  

picture  of  the  labour  market  experiences  of  low-skilled  NPRs.  Low-skilled  workers  in  the   Agriculture,  forestry,  fishing  and  hunting  industry  sector  earn  the  lowest  absolute  wage.   They  were  followed  by  workers  in  the  `Other  Services'  sector  (except  public   administration).  Low-skilled  NPRs  exhibited  low  relative  wages  (lower  than  CB  and   IMM)  in  11  out  of  the  13  industry  sectors  analyzed.  In  the  remaining  two,  NPRs   exhibited  a  higher  mean  wage  than  the  CB  and  IMM.  Not  accounting  for  room  and   board,  Babysitters,  Nannies  and  Parents'  Helpers  exhibited  the  lowest  mean  absolute   wage  of  all  43  occupations  analyzed.  They  were  followed  by  low-skilled  workers  in   agriculture  (Nursery  and  Greenhouse  Workers  and  Harvesting  Labourers).  The  quartile   analysis  reveals  a  high  concentration  of  low-skilled  workers  around  low  wages  in  some   occupations.    Occupations  with  these  characteristics  include:  8431-General  farm   workers;  8432-Nursery  and  greenhouse  workers;  6471-Visiting  homemakers,   housekeepers  and  related  occupations;  6474-Babysitters,  nannies  and  parents'  helpers;   6641-Food  counter  attendants,  kitchen  helpers  and  related  occupations;  6611-Cashiers;   and  8611-Harvesting  labourers.  Most  workers  in  these  occupations  are  concentrated   around  wages  close  to  the  minimum  wage  (more  than  three  quarters  in  each  occupation   have  wages  close  to  minimum  wage).85        Low-skilled  NPRs  earn  lower  wages  than  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  workers  

across  most  occupations.  This  is  also  evident  when  comparing  quartile  by  quartile.   Quartile  differences  confirm  those  calculated  with  the  averages  of  the  populations  by   immigration  status  (NPR-CB  and  NPR-IMM)  in  each  occupation.

Nursery  and  Greenhouse  Workers  is  among  the  occupations  with  the  lowest  wages   among  the  NPR  population.  Workers  in  this  occupation  were  also  among  the  workers   with  the  greatest  wage  differences  when  compared  with  Canadian-born  and  immigrant   workers.  Surmounting  the  interpretative  difficulties  that  arise  when  wage  dispersion   affects  averages  and  their  comparability,  the  quartile  analysis  confirmed  what  was  found   in  the  samples  with  high  dispersion.  A  condensed  and  punctual  summary  of  the   outcomes  of  this  chapter  framed  by  the  first  hypothesis  outlined  in  chapter  two  is   presented  in  the  following  table  (Table  9).       
Table  9-  Summary  of  Hypothesis/Chapter  Findings  (Cross-Tabulation  Absolute  Wages)   Hypotheses   1.  NPRs  earn   lower  wages   than  CB  and   IMM  in  all   industry   sectors  and   occupations  in   this  study.   Findings   1.1.  Low-skilled  workers  in  the  Agriculture,  forestry,  fishing  and  hunting  industry  sector   earn  the  lowest  wages  (an  average  of  $10.10/hour).  They  were  followed  by  workers  in   the  `Other  Services'  sector  (except  public  administration),  averaging  approximately   $10.20/hour.  This  is  a  composite  service  sector  and  includes  caregiving  occupations   (wages  include  room  and  board),  which  comprise  the  largest  number  of  NPRs.     1.2.  Low-skilled  NPRs  earned  lower  wages  than  CB  and  IMM  in  11  out  of  the  13   industry  sectors  analyzed.  However,  large  wage  dispersion  (a  few  cases  with  high   wages  in  each  occupation)  makes  an  occupation  level  analysis  necessary.   2.  Babysitters  and  nannies  had  the  lowest  absolute  wages  (not  accounting  for  room   and  board)  among  the  43  occupations  analyzed.  They  were  followed  by  low-skilled   workers  in  agricultural  occupations.  However,  mean  wages  were  rather  high.  High   mean  wages  are  related  to  wage  dispersion.   3.  Just  over  half  of  all  NPRs  (52%)  work  in  only  7  occupations  which  exhibit  high   concentration  of  NPRs  in  low  wages;  12  occupation  have  a  high  concentration  around   high  wages  (they  represent  30%  of  all  NPRs)   4.  Low-skilled  NPRs  reported  lower  wages  than  CB  and  IMM  in  most  occupations.  Of   the  43  analyzed,  35  occupations  passed  the  Bonferroni  test  and  had  enough  counts   (more  than  90).  Of  these  35  occupations,  in  31  NPRs  had  lower  wages  than  CB  and   IMM.  In  the  remaining  four  occupations,  the  NPR  mean  wages  were  above  CB  and   IMM  mean  wages.  The  quartile  analysis  showed  that  out  of  these  four,  only  one  (Truck   Drivers)  offered  genuinely  higher  wages  for  NPRs.  Occupations  6474-Babysitters,   Nannies  and  Parents  Helpers;  8432  Nursery  and  Greenhouse  Workers  and  8433- General  Farmworkers  are  among  the  occupations  with  the  lowest  wages  among  the   NPR  population  and  with  the  highest  wage  differences  compared  with  CB  and  IMM.

Chapter  Seven:  Wage  Analysis  Considering  Intrinsic  Characteristics  of   Workers  and  Occupations      As  seen  in  the  previous  chapter,  low-skilled  NPRs'  absolute  and  relative  wages  

(when  compared  to  the  CB  and  IMM)  at  the  industry  and  occupation  levels  are  generally   disadvantaged  by  a  lack  of  citizenship.  The  analysis  now  shifts  to  evaluate  the  effects  of   intrinsic  characteristics  of  occupations  (province  of  residence,  rural/urban  place  of  work)   and  of  NPR  workers  (sex,  level  of  education,  knowledge  of  English  or  French  and   Country  of  Birth)  on  the  wages  of  low-skilled  NPRs.  Introducing  intrinsic  characteristics   to  the  occupation-level  analysis,  further  strengthens  the  analysis,  by  yielding  outcomes   that  are  even  closer  to  the  lived  experiences  of  the  individuals  examined.  This  type  of   analysis  is  also  relevant  because  it  provides  information  about  the  independent  effects   (positive  or  negative)  each  of  those  characteristics  may  have  on  low-skilled  NPRs'   wages,  additional  to  that  of  lack  of  citizenship.  The  analysis  in  this  section  dives  deeper   by  engaging  in  a  more  granular  way  the  likely  effects  of  those  intrinsic  characteristics  on   the  wages  of  NPRs.  This  chapter  presents  the  cross-tabulation  of  the  relative  wages  of   NPRs  (compared  to  CB  and  IMM)  in  each  occupation  and  each  category  of  each   intrinsic  characteristic.  Such  outcomes  are  further  complemented  by  a  regression   analysis  in  the  following  chapter.      Some  methodological  considerations  worth  recalling  include:  the  number  of  

occupations  analyzed  change  from  one  characteristic  to  the  next  because  the  number   of  cases  by  occupation  an  population  gets  subdivided  even  further  in  each   characteristic.  Characteristics  with  more  options  subdivide  even  more  the  populations,   which  constrains  even  more  the  number  of  occupations  possible  to  analyze.  For  

185  

     

example,  the  number  of  occupations  analyzed  by  sex  (only  two  categories  ­  male,   female)  is  higher  that  the  number  of  occupations  by  province  of  residence.  Additionally,   categories  in  each  characteristic  are  not  subdivided  equally  (e.g.  provinces  have   significantly  different  populations).        Five  outcomes  worth  highlighting  are:  1)  Low-skilled  NPRs  tend  to  have  larger  

negative  wage  differences  (when  their  wages  are  compared  to  those  of  the  CB  and   IMM)  in  Ontario  than  those  of  low-skilled  workers  in  other  provinces;  2)  Wage   differences  (of  NPRs  compared  to  the  CB  and  IMM)  in  rural  areas  are  negative  and   larger  (in  absolute  value)  than  those  in  urban  areas  (which  are  all  negative  too);  3)  Both   male  and  female  low-skilled  NPRs  earn  less  wage  than  their  CB  and  IMM  counterparts   in  all  occupations  analyzed  in  each  category;  4)  A  hierarchy  of  occupations  by  country  of   birth  was  also  identified.  Those  coming  from  mostly  European  countries  with  high  official   language  ability  work  in  the  better  paid  low-skilled  occupations.  In  contrast,  highly   physically  demanding  occupations  are  filled  with  workers  coming  mostly  from  the   developing  world;  5)  In  some  occupations  wages  improve  when  citizenship  is  accounted   for  among  foreign-born  con-nationals.  For  example,  though  still  less  than  Canadian- born  workers,  the  wages  of  Mexican  immigrants  (i.e.  those  with  access  to  citizenship)   working  in  occupation  8431-General  farm  workers  are  considerably  higher  than  those  of   Mexican  NPRs  working  in  the  same  occupation.      The  chapter  is  organized  in  six  sections  each  addressing  each  one  of  the  intrinsic  

characteristics  of  workers  (sex,  level  of  education,  knowledge  of  official  language  and   country  of  birth)  and  their  occupations  (province  of  residence,  rural-urban  location)   analyzed.  As  with  chapter  six,  this  chapter  presents  results  and  does  not  include  an  

186  

     

analysis  of  outcomes  (i.e.  an  explanation  of  wage  differences),  something  that  will  be   covered  in  chapter  nine.  The  quartile  analysis  was  also  used  a  s  a  way  to  corroborate   outcomes  in  this  chapter.  The  first  two  sections  focus  on  the  intrinsic  characteristics  of   occupations;  the  remaining  four  on  the  intrinsic  characteristics  of  NPRs.      7.1.  Wage  differences  by  Province  of  Residence      Wages  follow  the  behaviour  of  regional  economies.  While  the  aggregate  wage  

level  provides  an  indicator  of  wages  nationwide  at  the  occupation  level,  there  are   embedded  distortions  stemming  from  different  factors.  One  such  factor  is  the  regional   behaviour  of  the  labour  market.  While  a  close  look  into  regional  labour  markets  would   ideally  explore  wages  at  a  sub-provincial  level,  restrictions  in  sample  size  limit  the  focus   of  this  research  to  the  Canadian  provinces  only.  Even  in  regions  that  group  together   different  provinces,  like  the  Atlantic  provinces,  sample  size  did  not  provide  a  significant   number  of  NPRs  to  be  able  to  do  a  reliable  comparison  by  immigration  status  at  the   occupation  level.  After  merging  Manitoba  and  Saskatchewan  in  the  effort  to  obtain  a   reliable  sample  size,  sample  sizes  nevertheless  only  permitted  a  limited  number  of   occupations.   Table  10  introduces  the  wage  differences  NPR  -  Canadian-born  (NPR-CB)  and  NPR- Immigrants  (NPR-IMM)  by  province.  The  table  includes  selected  occupations  with  a   significant  number  of  NPRs  in  more  than  one  province,  which  allows  for  interprovincial   comparisons.

Table  10:  Provincial  Wage  Differences  in  Selected  Occupations  

     

  

According  to  the  table,  across  most  occupations  and  provinces,  wages  of  NPRs  

tend  to  be  lower  than  those  of  their  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  counterparts.   Occupation-specific  comparisons  have  different  patterns.  The  highest  differences  are   distributed  mostly  across  Quebec  and  Ontario.  In  at  least  five  occupations,  Ontario's   188  
     

NPR-CB  wage  differences  are  highest  compared  to  other  provinces.  These  occupations   are:     1.   6421  Retail  salespersons  and  sales  clerks  (-25%);     2.   6471  Visiting  homemakers,  housekeepers  and  related  occupations  (-29%);    
3.   6474  Babysitters,  nannies  and  parents'  helpers  (-17%);   4.   6641  Food  counter  attendants,  kitchen  helpers  and  related  occupations  (-30%);  and  

5.   9462  Industrial  butchers  and  meat  cutters,  poultry  preparers  and  related  workers.      Quebec's  NPR-CB  wage  differences  are  highest  compared  with  other  provinces,  

in  at  least  six  occupations.  These  occupations  are:  
1.   6661  Light  duty  cleaners  (-22%);   2.   7452  Material  handlers  (-35%);   3.   8432  Nursery  and  greenhouse  workers  (-20%);   4.   9617  Labourers  in  food,  beverage  and  tobacco  processing  (-38%);   5.   9619  Other  labourers  in  processing,  manufacturing  and  utilities  (-43%);  and   6.   1453  Customer  service,  information  and  related  clerks  (-30%).  

  

  Occupations  exhibiting  the  highest  wage  discrepancies  are  primarily  in  the  main  

economic  sectors  that  drive  Quebec's  and  Ontario's  economies  (Agriculture,  Services   and  Manufacturing).  Wage  differences  in  BC  for  6453-Food  and  beverage  servers  are   significantly  high  and  provide  an  illuminating  case  study.  While  wage  differences  in  this   occupation  in  other  provinces  were  not  statistically  significant,  in  British  Columbia  very   low  wages  are  concentrated  in  a  significant  proportion  of  NPRs  (See  Table  8  in  chapter  

189  

     

six).86  A  section  in  chapter  nine  focuses  on  this  case.      Regarding  occupation  specific  differences,  occupation  6474-Babysitters,  Nannies  

and  Parent  Helpers  is  the  occupation  with  the  highest  representation  of  NPRs  in  most   provinces.  In  this  occupation,  Ontario  is  the  province  with  the  highest  wage  discrepancy   (17%  and  10%  less  for  NPRs  compared  to  CB  and  IMM,  respectively).  Ontario  is   followed  by  Quebec,  where  NPRs  earn  6%  and  5%  less  than  CB  and  IMM,  respectively.        Occupation  8432-Nursery  and  Greenhouse  Workers  exhibits  the  highest  NPRs-

CB  and  NPR-IMM  wage  differences  in  Quebec.  Table  10  shows  that  NPRs  earn  20%   and  32%  less  than  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  workers.  In  Ontario  these  differences   are  also  unfavourable  to  NPRs.  They  earn  15%  and  24%  less  than  their  Canadian-born   and  immigrant  counterparts.        7.2.  Wage  Differences  by  Rural-Urban  Location   Urban  areas  in  the  census  refer  to  concentrations  of  at  least  1  000  people  with  a   density  of  at  least  400  persons  per  square  kilometer;  "all  territory  outside  urban  areas  is   considered  rural"  (Census  2006,  Codebook,  p.18).  Most  occupations  in  Canada  group   together  jobs  based  in  urban  settings,  where  most  industries  develop  their  activities.     Yet  a  significant  part  of  low-skilled  labour  also  takes  place  in  rural  areas.  Occupations   related  to  the  agribusiness,  for  examples,  mostly  take  place  in  rural  Canada,  although   some  of  those  activities  also  take  place  in  urban  areas.     
                                                                                                 
86

  This  is  also  the  case  in  occupation  6641-Food  counter  attendants,  kitchen  helpers  and  related   occupations.  Both  cases  will  be  analyzed  in  more  detail  in  chapter  eight.

Wage  Differences  ­  Rural.  Figure  11  shows  the  statistically  significant  wage  

differences  of  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  workers  compared  to  NPRs  working  in   rural  Canada.  As  explained,  most  rural  occupations  are  in  the  agricultural  sector.   However,  compared  with  other  occupations  in  rural  areas,  wage  differences  in  the   agricultural  sector  are  not  as  dramatic  as  in  occupation  6471-Visiting  Homemakers.   NPRs  earn  between  15%  and  31%  less  than  Canadian-born  workers  and  approximately   15%  less  than  immigrants  working  in  occupation  8432-Nursery  and  greenhouse   workers.  In  occupation  NOC  6471-Visiting  Homemakers,  wages  of  NPRs  are   approximately  37%  less  than  Canadian-born  workers  and  37%  less  than  immigrants.   Comparable  differences  are  also  evident  in  urban  areas.

   Wage  Differences  ­  Urban.  Figure  12  introduces  the  statistically  significant  wage  

differences  of  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  workers  compared  to  NPRs  working  in   urban  areas.  It  is  worth  mentioning  that  NPRs  in  occupations  6611-Cashiers  and  7411- 191  
     

Truck  drivers  exhibited  statistically  significant  positive  wage  differences  compared  to   their  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  counter-parts.  In  other  words,  NPRs  appeared  to   have  earned  higher  wages  than  CB  and  IMM  in  these  occupations.  The  results  of  the   quartile  analysis,  however,  reveal  that  wage  differences  for  the  second  and  third  quartile   were  negative  (with  NPRs  earning  an  average  wage  lower  than  that  of  either  CB  or   IMM).  As  explained  earlier,  the  difference  between  the  analysis  of  the  whole  population   in  each  of  these  two  occupations  and  the  quartile  analysis  is  a  function  of  wage   dispersion.  Due  to  this  discrepancy,  outcomes  in  these  occupations  were  not  included  in   Figure  14.

Figure  12:  Statistically  Significant  Average  Wage  Differences  in  an  Urban  Location  (Source:  2006   Census)     

      Most  occupations  in  urban  settings  replicate  the  results  found  in  the  general  

summary  provided  at  the  beginning  of  this  chapter.  Some  occupations  worth  mentioning   are  1413-Nurse  aides,  orderlies  and  patient  service  associates  and  6471-Visiting   192  
     

homemakers,  housekeepers  and  related  occupations.  NPRs  in  these  occupations   recorded  wages  33%  and  36%,  respectively,  lower  than  immigrants.  It  is  worth   mentioning  though  that  some  occupations  appearing  in  rural  areas  are  also  found  in   urban  areas,  including  Babysitters  and  Nannies  (NOC-6474),  Visiting  Homemakers   (NOC-6471)  and  Nursery  and  greenhouse  workers  (NOC-8432),  in  which  the  wage   discrepancies  are  not  as  large.  For  example,  when  accounting  for  room  and  board   (private  room  or  $2.07/hour  additional  compensation),  while  NPR  babysitters  and   nannies  earn  24%  less  than  their  Canadian-born  counterparts  in  rural  areas,  in  urban   areas  this  difference  is  only  11%.  It  is  also  worth  noting  that  wages,  and  the  cost  of   living  in  general,  is  lower  in  rural  areas,  though  poverty  in  these  areas  remains   prominent.  The  analysis  will  now  switch  to  the  intrinsic  characteristics  of  NPRs  including   sex,  level  of  education  and  country  of  birth.      7.3.  Wage  Differences  Within  Each  Sex  by  Immigration  Status      Sex  influences  wage  behaviour  by  distinguishing  between  males  and  females  in  

specific  occupations.  Given  that  this  research  examines  differences  according  to   immigration  status,  this  part  of  the  analysis  will  not  compare  differences  between  sexes,   but  rather  differences  within  one  sex  by  immigration  status      7.3.1.  Wage  differences  (NPR-CB  and  NPR-IMM)  for  females.  Figure  13   shows  the  statistically  significant  wage  differences  among  female  low-skilled  workers.  In   keeping  with  the  overall  trend  thus  far,  female  NPRs  also  experience  lower  wages  than   female  Canadian-born  workers  and  female  immigrants  in  the  same  occupation.  The  

193  

     

highest  wage  difference  is  found  in  occupation  6474-Babysitters,  nannies  and  parents'   helpers  (not  accounting  for  live-in  conditions),  with  female  NPRs  earning  31%  less  than   their  Canadian-born  counterparts.  Accounting  for  live-in  conditions,  differences   decrease  but  remain  negative  (8%  less  than  CB  and  6%  less  than  IMM).  This  is   followed  by  9619-Other  labourers  in  processing,  manufacturing  and  utilities,  where   female  NPRs  earn  27%  less  than  female  Canadian-born  workers.  Compared  to  low- skilled  female  immigrants,  low-skilled  female  NPRs  had  the  greatest  negative  difference   in  occupation  6471-Visiting  homemakers,  housekeepers  and  related  occupations  (35%   less  wage),  followed  by  1413-Nurse  aides,  orderlies  and  patient  service  associates   (34%  less  wage).  As  we  will  see,  low-skilled  male  NPRs  also  exhibit  lower  wages  than   their  Canadian-born  and  Immigrant  counterparts.

Note  that  combined  wages  of  second  and  third  quartiles  are  used  to  corroborate  

mean  wage  differences  for  both  males  and  females  when  their  wages  are  compared   against  those  of  their  CB  and  IMM  counterparts.  This  process  was  done  for  the   characteristics  and  occupations  that  allowed  a  quartile  analysis  (enough  number  of   counts  in  the  2nd  and  3rd  quartile).  Given  that  this  research  compares  the  wages  of   NPRs  against  those  of  CB  and  IMM,  the  second  and  third  quartiles  are  chosen  as   representatives  of  the  population  in  each  occupation.  These  quartiles  are  chosen   because  they  represent  the  center  of  the  range  in  each  occupation  (25%  to  75%  of  the   wage  range).  Appendix  nine  includes  figures  that  compare  the  wages  of  NPRs  in  the   second  and  third  quartile  against  the  wages  of  CB  and  IMM  in  the  second  and  third   quartiles.  Such  figures  support  comparisons  drawn  for  the  entire  population.  If,  for   example  the  wage  difference  in  occupation  x  is  negative  for  the  population  and  negative   for  the  second  and  third  quartiles,  then  it  is  most  likely  negative.  If  differences  for  entire   populations  are  positive  but  negative  for  quartiles,  then  the  unmerged  quartiles  provide   information  about  these  discrepancies  (ex.  occupations  with  a  high  concentration  in  the   fourth  quartile).  Appendix  nine  presents  wage  differences  by  sex,  province  of  residence,   rural/urban,  language  ability  (English)  and  level  of  education.  Figures  A9.1.  to  A9.5.   present  these  results.    
  

  

7.3.2.  Wage  differences  (NPR-CB  and  NPR-IMM)  for  males.  Figure  14  

presents  the  statistically  significant  average  wage  differences  among  the  top  10  low- skilled  occupations  for  male  workers.  Male  NPRs  working  in  occupation  6471-Visiting   homemakers,  housekeepers  and  related  occupations  have  the  largest  negative   difference  in  wages  compared  to  both  Canadian-born  employees  (46%)  and  immigrants   195  
     

(48%)  working  in  the  same  occupation.  Male  NPRs  working  as  8432-Nursery  and   Greenhouse  workers  (8432)  also  have  a  significant  wage  difference  compared  to  male   IMM  in  the  same  occupation  (29%  less  wage).

   Given  that  labour  market  conditions  are  region  specific,  analyzing  regional   differences  and  intrinsic  characteristics  may  shed  light  on  the  rationale  behind  wage   differences.  The  next  section  explores  wage  differences  by  level  of  education.        196

Figure  15:  Statistically  Significant  Average  Hourly  Wage  Differences  (NPR-CB)  and  (NPR-IMM)  (Source:   2006  Census).  

  

   Figure  15  presents  wage  differences  between  NPR-CB  and  NPR-IMM  with  statistically   197  
     

significant  outcomes  among  the  top  10  occupations  tested.  Wage  differences  by  level  of   education  in  the  top  10  occupations  tested  in  this  section  were  all  negative.  That  is,  in   all  cases  tested,  NPRs  earned  less  than  CB  and  IMM.  Three  cases  are  worth   presenting.         First,  in  occupation  1431-Accounting  and  Related  Clerks  wage  gaps  are  smaller   among  those  with  university  degrees  than  among  those  with  high  school  education  or   less.  Stated  otherwise,  in  this  occupation,  a  university  degree  helps  NPRs  to  earn   wages  closer  to  those  of  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  workers.  Second,  in  three   occupations  (6474,  6453  and  1431)  the  NPR-IMM  wage  gap  for  those  with  college   degrees  or  trades  certificates  is  smaller  than  the  wage  gap  of  those  with  high  school   certificates  or  less.  Further  research  could  help  to  explain  this.      Third,  in  the  remaining  five  occupations  analyzed,  the  opposite  tendency  

occurred.  That  is,  the  wage  gap  among  those  with  post-secondary  education  was  bigger   than  the  wage  gap  among  those  with  high  school  education  or  less.  Thus,  in  those   occupations,  having  a  university  diploma  has  no  positive  effect  on  the  wage  gap.   Examples  of  these  are  workers  in  occupations  6471-Visiting  Homemakers  and   Housekeepers,  8431-General  farm  workers  and  3113-Nurse  Aides,  Orderlies  and   Patient  Service  Associates.      Occupations  like  8431-General  Farm  Workers  value  experience.  Most  NPRs  

working  in  farm-related  work,  also  do  it  in  their  countries  of  origin  and,  for  the  most  part,   lack  formal  education.  It  is  possible  that  most  of  them  have  no  formal  education   whatsoever,  but  rather  experience  in  farm-related  labour.  For  example,  of  all  NPRs  in   occupation  8431-General  Farm  Workers,  89%  had  a  high  school  diploma  or  less  and   198  
     

experience  working  in  farm-related  labour;  this  is  a  requirement  to  work  in  agricultural   occupations.  Work  related  experience  in  their  countries  of  origin  and  in  Canada   increases  NPRs'  chances  of  earning  higher  wages  and,  by  extension,  of  diminishing  the   wage  gap  between  NPRs  and  Canadian-born  or  immigrant  populations.  Many  farm   workers  come  year  after  year,  which  may  also  increase  NPRs'  seniority  and,  over  time,   their  wages.      7.5.  Wage  Differences  by  Knowledge  of  First  Official  Languages      This  section  explores  the  impact  of  speaking  one  of  Canada's  official  languages  

(English  or  French).  This  part  of  the  analysis  uses  the  variable  (FOL-  First  Official   Language  spoken)  reported  in  the  census,  which  is  self-reported  and  may  not   accurately  measure  one's  capacity  to  speak  either  official  language.        Given  the  subjective  characteristic  of  this  variable,  results  may  need  further   investigation.  That  said,  the  variable  FOL  nevertheless  provides  initial  insight  into  the   effect  of  official  language  ability  on  labour  market  outcomes  among  the  low-skilled   population.  Figure  16  shows  statistically  significant  wage  differences  between  NPRs   and  IMM  who  report  speaking  English.  In  all  occupations  included  in  this  section,  NPRs   showed  lower  wages  than  immigrants.  As  previously  mentioned,  differences  between   NPRs  and  CB  workers  are  not  reported  since  the  latter  are  expected  to  speak  English.   Although  it  would  have  been  ideal  to  compare  the  wages  of  those  who  do  not  speak   English  with  those  who  do,  sample  sizes  among  those  who  do  not  speak  English   precluded  such  analysis.

      Since  occupations  in  which  one  is  expected  to  speak  either  English  or  French   (i.e.  6474-Babysitters,  nannies  and  parents'  helpers)  are  not  worth  exploring,  attention   was  paid  to  occupations  with  no  language  requirements,  but  with  a  significant  number  of   NPRs,  like  8432-Nursery  and  greenhouse  workers.  Figure  16  shows  NPRs  in  this   occupation  who  report  speaking  English  earning  15%  less  than  IMM.  In  contrast,  wage   differences  at  the  population  level  (Figure  10)  show  NPRs  (mostly  non-English   speakers)87  earning  22%  less  than  IMM,  which  indicates  that  speaking  English  has  a   positive  effect  on  wages  in  this  occupation.      Another  occupation  that  does  not  require  English  is  8431-General  Farm  workers.  

In  contrast  with  the  wage  difference  for  the  whole  population  (Figure  10),  of  which  the

  Most  workers  in  this  in  this  occupation  come  from  Mexico  (80%)  and  Jamaica  (11%)  (2006  Census).        

200  

     

group  of  primarily  non-English  speaking  NPRs88  earns  15%  less  than  IMM,  when   language  is  introduced  the  wage  gap  reduces  by  two  percentage  points  to  13%  (Figure   16).  Once  again,  speaking  English  seems  to  have  a  positive  effect  on  NPRs'  wages.  A   clearer  picture  will  emerge  with  the  regression  analysis.  Unfortunately,  no  occupation   had  a  sample  size  big  enough  to  allow  a  comparison  at  the  occupation  level  between   NPRs  and  IMM  who  speak  French.    
  

7.6.  Wage  Differences  by  Country  of  Birth  (COB)      Country  of  birth  provides  a  closer  look  at  the  impact  of  ethnic  origin,  which  can  be  

proxy-ed  and  more  closely  targeted  through  the  country  of  birth,  on  wages.  An  analysis   of  wages  by  immigration  status  and  country  of  birth  required  selecting  NPRs  in  a   specific  occupation  from  a  specific  country  and  comparing  them  with  immigrants  from   the  same  country  and  with  Canadian-born  working  on  those  occupations.  Coinciding   with  the  variety  of  countries  of  birth,  there  is  a  variety  of  wage  distribution  by  country  of   birth  per  occupation.  Table  11  presents  the  wages  of  low-skilled  workers  by  country  of   birth  in  selected  occupations  (appendix  11  includes  an  extended  version  of  this  table,   with  outcomes  for  the  24  occupations89  analyzed  in  this  section).  The  table  gathers   information  about  wages,  according  to  immigration  status  and  country  of  birth  as  well  as   the  wage  differentials.  Four  trends  were  identified:        
                                                                                                 
88

  Most  NPRs  in  this  occupation  come  from  Mexico  (55%),  Jamaica  (16%)  and  Trinidad  and  Tobago  (8%)   (2006  Census).   89   The  24  occupations  correspond  to  the  number  of  occupations  with  enough  counts  (90)  and  with   statistically  significant  outcomes.

7.6.1.  Concentration  around  low-paid  occupations  or  with  significant  wage   difference  (compared  to  CB  and  IMM).    Low-skilled  workers  from  developing  world   countries  concentrate  around  physically  demanding  occupations.  They  are  present  in   large  numbers  and  mainly  come  from  the  Philippines,  China,  India  and  Mexico.  India,   the  Philippines  and  China  are  the  top  three  countries  of  origin  among  the  immigrant   population  in  Canada,  making  up  approximately  25%  of  low-skilled  immigrants  (see   Table  7  in  chapter  five).  These  same  three  countries  are  among  the  top  five  countries  of   origin  among  the  NPR  populations  representing  approximately  38%  of  all  low-skilled   NPRs.  Viewed  together  these  three  countries  are  significant  in  the  low-skilled  Canadian   labour  force.  Filipinos  (joined  by  Mexicans)  are  amongst  the  lowest  earners.  Indians  and   Chinese  are  middle  to  low  earners.  Their  wage  differences  compared  with  those  of   Canadian-born  workers  are  significant.  For  instance,  Indian-born  NPR  truck  drivers   have  wages  20%  lower  than  Canadian-born  truck  drivers.      NPR  workers  from  Mexico  work  in  physically  demanding  occupations  (Basok,  

2002)  with  very  low  wages.  Workers  in  this  group  are  clustered  in  occupations  including   8431-General  farm  workers,  8432-Nursery  and  greenhouse  workers.  Those  from  the   Philippines  work  primarily  in  caregiving  and  domestic  labour.  Mexican  NPRs  in   occupation  8431  and  8432  earn  20%  and  24%  less,  respectively,  than  Canadian-born   employees.  
  

7.6.2.  Concentration  around  the  highest  paying  low-skilled  jobs.  Low-skilled   workers  from  western  and  southern  Europe  concentrate  around  the  highest  paying  low- skilled  jobs.  A  certain  kind  of  job  hierarchy,  according  to  country  of  origin,  seems  to   203  
     

emerge.  Workers  coming  from  developed  nations  (United  Kingdom,  United  States,  and   Germany)  tend  to  gather  around  clerical  jobs,  which  are  among  the  highest  paid  low- skilled  jobs.  In  some  cases,  these  workers  earn  higher  wages  than  their  Canadian-born   counterparts.  Low-skilled  immigrant  workers  from  the  United  Kingdom  appear  to  have   the  highest  wages.  Occupations  in  this  group  include:  1411-General  Office  Clerks,   1431-Accounting  and  related  clerks.  Although  these  occupations  are  included  among   the  low-skilled,  they  are  within  the  skill  level  group  C,  which  requires  high  school  or   occupation  specific  training.  As  outlined  above,  this  level  is  above  level  D.  Other  skills   may  also  improve  access  to  these  jobs,  for  example,  knowledge  of  either  official   language  and  additional  education  or  training.  In  some  occupations,  even  after  having   Canadian  citizenship,  wage  differences  are  positive  for  workers  coming  from  developed   nations  (i.e.  UK)  and  negative  for  those  coming  from  developing  nations  (i.e.  China).   British-born  low-skilled  immigrant  workers  in  occupation  1431-Accounting  and  related   clerks  earn  16%  more  wage  than  Canadian  born  workers.  In  contrast,  Chinese-born   workers  in  the  same  occupation  earn  14%  less  than  their  Canadian-born  counterparts.   Even  if  both  (British  and  Chinese)  have  Canadian  citizenship,  those  from  China  have  a   significant  wage  difference  compared  to  those  from  the  UK.  
  

  

7.6.3.  Niche-occupation  concentration  around  certain  countries  of  origin.  

Some  occupations  exhibit  niche-occupation  concentration  around  certain  countries  of   origin  including  Mexico,  Philippines,  Portugal  and  Italy.  Occupation  6663  Janitors,   caretakers  and  building  superintendents  also  exhibits  a  kind  of  hierarchy.  Low-skilled   Italian-born  immigrants  earn  the  highest  wages,  13%  higher  than  Canadian-born   workers,  who  earn  the  second  highest  wages,  followed  by  Mexican  and  Indian  workers,   204  
     

who  earn  16%  and  17%  less  than  Canadian-born  employees.  One  possible  argument  to   explain  these  differences  is  a  sort  of  niche  behaviour  among  certain  ethnic  groups.        Another  niche  occupation  is  6474-Babysitters,  nannies  and  parents'  helpers,  who  

come  primarily  from  the  Philippines.  Their  supremacy  is  not  reflected  in  wages  but  in  the   number  of  workers.  Low-skilled  immigrants  from  the  Philippines  are  reported  in  13  of  the   24  occupations  analyzed  in  this  section  and  tend  to  be  middle  to  low  earners  in  each   occupation.  Other  ethnic  communities  also  have  a  strong  presence,  reflected  in   numbers  rather  than  in  wages.  Low-skilled  Indian  immigrants  work  in  14  of  the  24   occupations  reported;  low-skilled  Chinese  immigrants  work  in  eight.  Mexican  presence   is  also  significant  in  occupations  in  agriculture.      It  is  also  worth  highlighting  that  Portuguese-speaking  low-skilled  workers  have  a  

significant  participation  in  occupation  7611-Construction  trades  helpers  and  labourers.   Of  all  immigrants  who  reported  working  in  this  occupation,  27.6%  are  from  either  Brazil   or  Portugal.  Clifton  (2008)  presents  the  case  of  Portuguese  workers  in  construction.         7.6.4.  Wages  improve  when  citizenship  is  accounted  for.    Wages  improve  in  

some  occupations  when  citizenship  is  accounted  for  among  foreign-born  individuals   born  in  the  same  country.  Access  to  citizenship  generally  improves  wage,  although,   Canadian-born  workers  still  earn  higher  wages  after  citizenship  is  accounted  for  among   foreign-born  low-skilled  workers.  Mexican  NPRs  working  in  occupation  8431-General   farm  workers  earn  20%  less  wage  than  their  Canadian-born  counterparts.  In  contrast,   Mexican-born  immigrants  (i.e.  with  access  to  citizenship)  working  in  the  same   occupation  earn  7%  less  than  Canadian-born  workers.  While  less  than  Canadian-born  

205  

     

workers,  the  wages  of  Mexican  immigrants  are  higher  than  those  of  Mexican  NPRs.   Thus,  Mexican  immigrants,  with  access  to  citizenship  (naturalized  Mexicans)  or  with  the   possibility  of  becoming  Canadian  citizens  (permanent  resident  Mexicans)  earn  14%   more  than  their  NPR  compatriots.  This  tendency  is  also  found  among  Filipino  workers  in   occupation  6474-Babysitters,  nannies  and  parents'  helpers.  Filipino  NPRs  earn  14%   less  than  Canadian-born  workers  and  9%  less  than  Filipino  immigrants.  Differences  in   wages  decrease  if  citizenship  is  accounted  for,  since  Filipino  immigrants  earn  5%  less   than  CB.        NPR  Truck  drivers  (NOC  7411)  from  the  United  Kingdom  earn  29%  less  than  

Canadian-born  workers  and  31%  less  than  UK-born  immigrants  (see  Table  11),   indicating  that  citizenship  also  makes  a  difference  in  this  occupation.            Summary     Wages  of  low-skilled  NPRs  compared  to  those  of  CB  and  IMM,  accounting  for  

characteristics  explored  in  this  chapter,  provides  a  good  picture  of  the  experiences  of   low-skilled  workers  without  citizenship.        Low-skilled  NPRs  earn  lower  wages  than  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  workers  

across  most  occupations  and  across  most  of  the  subcategories  of  the  characteristics   analyzed  (sex,  province  of  residence,  level  of  education,  rural/urban  location,  first  official   language  ability,  and  country  of  birth).  This  is  also  evident  when  comparing  quartile  by   quartile.  Surmounting  the  interpretative  difficulties  that  arise  when  wage  dispersion   affects  averages  and  their  comparability,  quartile  differences  confirm  those  calculated   with  the  averages  of  the  populations  by  immigration  status  (NPR-CB  and  NPR-IMM)  in  

206  

     

each  occupation.  Occupation  NOC  8432  Nursery  and  Greenhouse  Workers  is  among   the  occupations  with  the  lowest  wages  among  the  NPR  population  in  most   characteristics  analyzed.  Workers  in  this  occupation  were  also  among  the  workers  with   the  greatest  wage  differences  when  compared  with  Canadian-born  and  immigrant   workers  across  intrinsic  characteristics.        A  hierarchy  of  occupations  by  country  of  birth  was  also  identified.  Those  coming  

from  mostly  European  countries  with  high  official  language  ability  work  in  the  better  paid   low-skilled  occupations.  In  contrast,  highly  physically  demanding  occupations  are  filled   with  workers  coming  mostly  from  the  developing  world.  As  with  the  previous  chapter,  the   following  table  presents  a  condensed  and  punctual  summary  of  the  outcomes  of  this   chapter  framed  by  the  hypotheses  outlined  in  chapter  two  (Table  11A).     
Table  11A  -  Summary  of  Hypotheses/Chapter  Findings  (Cross-  Tabulation  Relative  Wages)   Hypotheses   1.  NPRs  earn   lower  wages  than   CB  and  IMM  by   sex  and   occupation   analyzed  in  this   section.   2.  NPRs  earn   lower  wages  than   CB  and  IMM  in  all   provinces  in  each   occupation   analyzed  in  this   section.   3.  NPRs  earn   lower  wages  than   CB  and  IMM  in   rural  and  urban   locations  in  each   occupation   Findings   2.1.  Females:  Of  the  14  top  occupations  tested,  six  had  statistically  significant   outcomes,  all  of  which  with  NPR  wages  lower  than  CB  and  IMM  wages.   2.2.  Males:  Of  the  top  14  occupations  for  males  tested,  six  exhibited  statistically   significant  lower  wages  for  NPRs  compared  with  CB.  10  of  the  14  exhibited   statistically  significant  lower  wages  for  NPRs  compared  with  IMM.  

2.  Province  of  Residence:  Wage  differences  among  NPRs  compared  to  CB  and   IMM  are  greater  in  Ontario  than  in  other  provinces.  In  all  occupations  with   statistically  significant  results,  NPR  wages  were  lower  than  those  of  CB.   Occupation  6474-Babysitters,  Nannies  and  Parents  Helpers  displayed  the  largest   differences.  

3.1.  Rural:  Wages  among  NPRs  are  lower  than  those  of  IMM  in  the  two   occupations  with  statistically  significant  results.  Differences  with  the  CB  population   were  negative  in  the  five  occupations  with  statistically  significant  results.   3.2.  Urban:  NPR  wages  were  lower  than  those  of  CB  and  IMM  in  all  seven   occupations  with  statistically  significant  outcomes.  Differences  in  Urban  settings   were  larger  for  6474-Babysitters,  Nannies  and  Parents  Helpers.

analyzed  in  this   section.   4.  NPRs  earn   lower  wages  than   CB  and  IMM  by   level  of  education   in  each   occupation   analyzed  in  this   section.   4.  In  the  top  10  occupations  tested,  NPRs  earn  less  than  CB  and  IMM  in  the  three   levels  of  education.  Three  cases  are  worth  presenting.         First,  in  occupation  1431-Accounting  and  Related  Clerks  the  wage  gap  is   smaller  among  those  with  a  university  degree  (UD)  than  among  those  with  high   school  or  less.         Second,  in  three  occupations  (6474,  6453  and  1431)  the  NPR-IMM  wage-gap   for  those  with  college  degrees  or  trades  certificates  (CD-TC)  is  smaller  than  the   wage  gap  of  those  with  high  school  or  less.     Third,  in  the  remaining  five  occupations  the  wage  gap  among  those  with  post- secondary  education  (UD  or  CD-TC)  was  bigger  than  the  wage  gap  of  those  with   high  school  or  less.   5.  NPRs  who   report  speaking   English  or  French   earn  lower  wages   than  IMM  who   also  report   speaking  English   or  French  in  each   occupation.   Additionally,   speaking  either   official  language   reduces  NPRs'   wage  gap   (compared  to   IMM).   6.  NPRs  earn   lower  wages  than   CB  and  IMM  by   country  of  birth  in   the  occupations   analyzed  in  this   section.   In  all  cases  NPRs  earned  less  than  CB  and  IMM.   5.1.  English:  Occupations  in  which  NPRs  are  expected  to  speak  English  (i.e.  6474- Babysitters,  nannies  and  Parents'  helpers)  were  not  examined,  since  speaking   English  has  no  effect  on  their  wages.  Other  occupations  were  worth  pursuing.  In  at   least  two  occupations  considered,  where  there  is  no  expectation  to  speak  English,   a  positive  effect  on  wages  among  NPRs  who  reported  speaking  English  was  found.   Their  wage  differences  were  smaller  than  those  of  the  whole  population  in  that   occupation.  This  is  a  valid  inference,  since  most  NPRs  in  those  occupations  come   from  non-English  speaking  countries.   5.2.  French:  Sample  size  did  not  allow  an  evaluation  of  effects  by  occupation   among  those  who  reported  speaking  French.  Nonetheless,  all  NPRs  who  reported   speaking  French  earned  13%  less  than  immigrants.  This  difference  is  smaller  than   that  for  the  whole  population  (27.3%  less  for  NPRs  compared  with  immigrants).   Therefore  speaking  French  seems  to  also  have  a  positive  effect  on  wages.  

The  country  of  birth  influences  the  wages  of  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  workers.   NPRs  coming  from  Mexico  and  the  Caribbean  tend  to  work  in  occupations  in   agriculture  which  have  lower  wages.  NPRs  from  the  Philippines  mostly  work  in   caregiving  occupations,  which  are  among  the  occupations  with  the  low  wages  and   with  the  large  wage  differences  compared  to  CB  and  IMM.  NPRs  coming  from  the   UK  tend  to  work  in  occupations  with  higher  wages.  Having  citizenship  reduces  the   wage  gap  between  Mexican-born  low-skilled  workers  and  Canadian-born  low- skilled  workers.

Chapter  Eight:  Regression  Analysis      The  previous  two  chapters  introduced  the  wage  differences  of  NPRs  compared  

to  the  CB  and  IMM.  This  type  of  study  though  relevant  is  still  limiting  because  some   variables  may  have  effects  on  others  that  are  not  captured  in  a  cross-tabulation   analysis.  This  previous  analysis  provided  a  partial  picture  because  it  was  done  one   variable  at  a  time,  independently.  Thus,  the  analysis  now  shifts  to  a  type  of  analysis  that   considers  all  variables  at  the  same  time.  Regression  analysis  further  enriches  our   findings  by  providing  outcomes  of  the  effect  of  lack  of  citizenship  on  wages  in  relation  to   the  intrinsic  characteristics  studied  in  the  previous  chapter.  A  regression  analysis  is   necessary  because,  although  the  outcomes  of  the  descriptive  analysis  (chapters  five,   six  and  seven)  provide  a  good  overview  of  the  demographics  and  the  wages  of  NPRs,  it   is  comprised  of  isolated,  unrelated  pieces.  To  evaluate  the  labour  market  outcomes  of   citizens  against  those  of  noncitizen  NPRs,  while  accounting  for  characteristics  such  as   sex,  province  of  residence  and  country  of  birth,  it  is  helpful  to  consider  these  factors  all   interrelated  rather  than  in  isolation,  which  the  regression  analysis  enables.  By  allowing   for  a  multivariable  analysis,  regression  permits  all  characteristics  to  be  considered  all  at   the  same  time,  while  providing  information  about  the  separate  effect  of  changes  in  each   characteristic  on  wages.  In  short,  it  provides  a  nuanced  view  of  the  effects  of  citizenship   (or  lack  thereof)  on  wages.      In  this  dissertation,  regression  is  a  mathematical  tool  used  to  explore  the  

changes  of  a  dependent  variable  in  relation  to  changes  in  a  series  of  independent   variables,  all  explored  at  the  same  time.  More  specifically,  in  this  study,  regression   analysis  helps  evaluate  the  change  in  a  dependent  variable  (wages)  in  relation  to  a  

209  

     

percentage  change  in  each  of  the  independent  variables  (all  other  characteristics   including  age,  sex,  immigration  status  and  level  of  education).  The  "effects"  on  wages  in   a  multiple  regression  analysis  are  understood  to  be  causal  (Engelhardt  &  Stukel,  2001).   Applying  the  logarithm  (LOG)90  to  the  dependent  variable  (wage)  allows  for  this  type  of   evaluation.      This  chapter  presents  the  outcomes  of  the  regression  analysis  according  to  

eleven  different  models  separated  in  two  categories.  The  first  model  uses  all  98   occupations  included  in  the  analysis.  Recall  that  the  original  number  of  98  occupations   was  further  reduced  to  43  and  35  to  perform  absolute  and  relative  wage  analysis  via   cross-tabulation  (chapter  six).  The  reductions  of  occupations  took  place  to  account  for   restrictions  in  the  number  of  counts  and  statistical  tests  of  comparability  of  means.  The   regression  analysis  in  this  model  uses  all  occupations  as  well  as  all  characteristics.  It   evaluates  their  effects  on  the  wages  of  low-skilled  workers,  especially  the  effect  of  lack   of  citizenship  seen  as  part  of  the  set  of  characteristics  in  this  analysis.  The  remaining   ten  models  correspond  to  the  analysis  of  ten  selected  NPR-relevant  specific   occupations.  These  ten  models  provide  a  more  focused  analysis  of  the  effects  of  the   intrinsic  characteristics  (of  workers  and  their  occupations)  on  the  wages  of  low-skilled   workers  in  each  specific  occupation.  As  with  the  first  model  that  uses  all  occupations,   the  ten  occupation  specific  models  treat  lack  of  citizenship  as  part  of  set  of

  "LOG"  refers  to  the  mathematical  function  "Natural  Logarithm."  When  a  variable  has  a  positive  skew  (a   few  very  high  values),  taking  the  natural  logarithm  helps  fit  the  variable  into  a  regression  model  by   normalizing  the  variable's  distribution  (see  section  8.1.  in  this  chapter).  Wage  is  a  variable  that  generally   tends  to  have  a  positive  skew,  therefore  a  LOG  transformation  is  essential.  The  outcomes  of  the  Log-ed   wages  in  a  regression  analysis  are  approximately  a  percent  variation  on  the  independent  variables  (not   the  LOG-ed  value  of  each  independent  variables),  because  "when  the  dependent  variable  but  not  an   independent  variable  is  logged  (sic),  a  one-unit  change  in  the  independent  variable  is  associated  with  a   100  times  the  coefficient  percent  change  in  the  dependent  variable"  (Princeton  University  Library  ­  Data   and  Statistical  Services,  2008)

characteristics.      As  a  whole,  the  regression  analysis  confirms  what  was  found  in  the  cross-

tabulation  analysis,  namely  that  low-skilled  NPRs  earn  lower  wages  than  their   Canadian-born  and  immigrant  counterparts.  As  we  will  see,  this  is  especially  evident   among  agricultural  workers.  This  chapter  focuses  primarily  on  the  outcomes  of  the   regression  models  and  includes  a  preliminary  analysis  of  the  results.  Together  with  the   outcomes  of  chapters  five,  six  and  seven  these  outcomes  will  also  be  incorporated  in   the  discussion  found  in  chapter  nine.      This  chapter  is  organized  into  three  main  sections.  In  the  first  section,  I  

contextualize  the  use  of  regression  analysis  in  this  dissertation  and  introduce  the  two   model  types  used:  type  one  uses  all  98  occupations  and  all  characteristics;  type  two   focuses  on  specific  NPR-relevant  occupations.  In  the  second  section,  I  introduce  the   outcomes  of  the  one  type  one  model;  and,  in  the  third  section  I  present  the  outcomes  of   ten  type  two  models.      8.1.  Regression  Models        As  previously  explained,  this  research  uses  Linear  Multiple  Regression  (see  

section  4.2.2.  in  chapter  four)  with  categorical  variables.  This  method  has  several   requirements  including  the  following:  1)  each  category  of  independent  variables  must  be   transformed  into  dummies;  2)  the  number  of  categories  transformed  into  dummies   minus  one  is  then  introduced  into  each  of  the  models  developed;  3)  the  dependent   variables  are  to  be  normally  distributed;  and  4)  there  is  to  be  no  co-linearity  between   subcategories  in  a  variable  or  between  variables  (Stockburger,  1998).    

211  

     

The  effects  of  the  independent  variables  (age,  sex,  etc.),  excluding  immigration   status,  will  be  contrasted  against  the  subcategory  "Non-Permanent  Resident   (Temporary  Foreign  Worker  and  Refugee  Claimant)"  under  "Immigration  Status."  The   regression  analysis  will  test  whether  being  a  NPR  (lacking  citizenship)  represents  a   significant  negative  effect  on  wage  compared  to  being  Canadian-born.        The  next  sections  explain  in  highly  technical  fashion  the  models  created  to  

perform  the  regression  analysis.  It  is  of  interest  to  see  in  each  model  the  variables   included  and  their  associated  coefficients  (Betas).  Each  coefficient,  beta,  will  provide   information  on  the  percentage  variation  of  wages  associated  to  the  respective   independent  variable.  Betas  are  listed  in  tables  12  and  appendix  14B  (Type  one  model   ­  all  occupations  included)  and  tables  13  and  14  (Type  two  models  ­  occupation  level   models).         Type  One  Model  (with  All  98  Occupations  and  All  Characteristics)  evaluates  

the  effects  of  all  independent  variables  influencing  wages,  including  all  low-skilled   occupations,  as  predictors.  It  serves  as  a  means  for  gauging  relationships  between   outcomes  in  the  labour  market  (wages)  of  low-skilled  workers  and  all  characteristics   (sex,  age,  regions  of  the  world,  etc.),  as  experienced  in  all  occupations.  This  type  of   model  provides  information  about  relationships  among  occupations  as  well  as  the   impact  that  citizenship  (or  lack  thereof)  has  on  wages.        It  is  important  to  clarify  that  this  kind  of  model  is  designed  to  evaluate  the  effects  

of  characteristics,  either  of  the  workers  (age,  immigration  status,  level  of  education,  etc.)   or  of  the  geography  (province  of  residence,  rural/urban  location)  or  of  the  jobs  

212  

     

themselves  (type  of  occupation).  It  does  not  account  for  any  macro-economic  effects,   which  therefore  limits  its  predictive  power.  Note  that  as  explained  wages  are  LOG-ed.   For  readers  interested  in  the  mathematical  formulae  deployed  to  derive  regression   calculations,  they  are  provided  below  (for  the  model  type  one)  and  in  the  subsequent   section  (for  models  type  two).          =  + ? () + A () + D (/  ) + M (    ) + R (    ) + T (        )+W (    ) + X (  ) + [ ()    
  

Type  Two  Models  (Ten  Occupation-Level  Models)  focuses  exclusively  on   specific  occupations.  This  type  of  models  is  needed  because  it  provides  more  detailed   information  on  the  relations  between  outcomes  in  the  labour  market  (wages)  and  the   characteristics  (age,  sex,  province  of  residence,  etc.,)  in  each  specific  occupation   analyzed.  Its  narrower  focus  makes  it  possible  to  recognize  relationships  between   dependent  and  independent  variables  for  each  occupation  in  isolation.  This  refines  the   analysis  and  helps  to  see  how  citizenship  (in  relation  to  characteristics,  including  age   and  sex)  relates  to  the  wages  in  each  occupation  with  the  highest  presence  of  low- skilled  NPRs.  A  unique  model  was  designed  for  each  analyzed  occupation.  These   models  evaluate  the  effects  of  the  independent  variables  (age,  sex,  etc.,)  on  the   dependent  variables  (wage)  in  each  occupation.  These  occupations  were  selected  as   relevant  for  NPRs  either  because  they  employ  a  significant  number  of  NPRs  or  because

Table  12:  Regression  Model  for  All  Occupations  (Dependent  Variable:  LOG  Hourly  Wages)  

Table  12  shows  the  outcomes  of  the  regression  model  for  hourly  wages  of  all  98  low-

218  

     

skilled  occupations  that  include  temporary  foreign  labour.  The  relation  between  the   independent  variables  (age,  immigration  status,  etc.)  and  the  dependent  variable   (wages)  are  expressed  through  the  B  coefficients  (see  column  B:  `Outcomes').  Given   that  wages  are  LOG-ed,  the  B  coefficient  is  a  reliable  approximation  of  a  percent   variation  of  the  independent  variable  with  respect  to  the  dependent  variable  in  each   model.  For  example,  in  this  model,  the  category  `Female'  of  the  variable  `Sex'  has  a  B  of   -0.142.  This  represents  a  decrease  (negative  sign)  of  about  14.2%  in  wages  compared   to  males.  Following,  the  analysis  draws  on  this  table  to  present  the  outcomes  of  model   one,  which  ratify  the  fact  that  lack  of  citizenship  penalizes  NPRs  significantly.  The   outcomes  are  introduced  with  an  underlined  statement  that  provides  information  on   relevant  outcomes.  These  outcomes  will  be  used  together  with  outcomes  of  chapter   five,  six  and  seven  in  the  next  chapter  that  compares  the  findings  of  this  dissertation   against  the  literature.     

This  model  makes  it  possible  to  examine  all  98  low-skilled  occupations  as  a  whole   and  to  make  comparisons  among  them.  Each  occupation  may  correspond  to  a  different   economic  sector  and  each  is  likely  to  have  completely  different  labour  conditions.  Some   may  be  more  seasonal,  others  more  physically  demanding,  etc.  A  comparison  among   occupations  is  relevant  since  all  low-skilled  occupations  are  regulated  under  the  same   policy  structure.  It  also  unveils  patterns  within  economic  sectors  or  industries  vis-a-vis   wages,  which  allows  an  indirect  cross-industry  comparison.  By  retrieving  information  on   the  effects  of  sex,  age,  immigration  status,  etc.  on  low-skilled  workers  it  becomes   possible  to  measure  the  general  state  of  low-skilled  labour  in  Canada.      8.2.1.  Immigration  status.  Immigration  status  presents  what  is  perhaps  the  most  

219  

     

striking  outcome  of  all  the  characteristics  that  may  influence  hourly  wages.  According  to   Table  12,  the  "Immigration  Status  -  Non-Permanent  Resident"  category  has  a  B  of  - 0.188.  This  means  that,  compared  to  Canadian-born  workers,  Non-Permanent   Residents  earn  18.8%  less.  Stated  otherwise,  lacking  citizenship  has  a  large  negative   effect  (18.8%  less  wage).        The  regression  model  corroborates  what  is  presented  in  the  descriptive  analysis  

in  the  previous  chapters.  In  comparison  with  low-skilled  Canadian-born  workers,  low- skilled  Immigrants  earn  just  under  6%  less  (B  =  -0.059),  which  is  not  very  distant  from   the  wages  earned  by  those  born  in  Canada.  In  view  of  this,  relatively  small,  wage  gap,   the  wage  discrepancy  between  those  with  citizenship  and  those  without  it  is  striking.  To   reiterate:  low-skilled  workers  without  citizenship  earn  almost  19%  less  than  their   Canadian  born  counterparts.  This  indicates  that  access  to  citizenship  indeed  increases   the  possibility  of  earning  higher  wages.  Seniority  may  also  have  an  influence  on  wages.   However,  the  census  did  not  allow  evaluating  seniority  among  the  NPR  population  (the   main  population  in  this  study)  because  such  information  is  not  collected.91  In  general,   non-citizenship  has  a  significant  negative  impact  on  the  wages  of  NPRs.  This  was  also   corroborated  across  the  entire  descriptive  analysis  in  chapters  five  and  six  and  will   become  even  more  evident  (focalized)  when  analyzing  specific  occupations.  These   findings  are  very  important,  since  it  is  often  argued  that  non-citizenship  is  not  related  to   the  level  of  wages  of  temporary  residents,  especially  of  temporary  foreign  workers.  It   has  been  posited  that  "employers  pay  the  temporary  foreign  workers  the  prevailing   wage  rate  for  jobs  of  that  type  in  the  particular  region"  (Fudge  &  MacPhail,  2009).   However,  "how  the  prevailing  wage  rate  is  set  [was]  both  controversial  and  opaque"

  Some  seasonal  TFWs  come  year  after  year.  

220  

     

(Fudge  &  MacPhail,  2009).        While  the  data  from  this  research  is  from  2006,  when  the  number  of  TFWs  was  

not  as  significant  as  it  is  now,  it  nevertheless  corroborates  what  more  recent  research   suggests.  In  Saskatchewan,  for  example,  the  highest  growth  of  low-skilled  TFWs  has   taken  place  in  industries  with  the  lowest  paying  jobs:  "Between  2005  and  2012,  food   counter  attendants,  kitchen  helpers  and  related  occupations  registered  as  the  top   occupational  group  by  number  of  foreign  workers  in  Saskatchewan  in  three  of  the  eight   years...Indeed,  the  top  TFW  occupations  have  shifted  from  high  skilled  health  care   practitioners  to  food  service  workers,  giving  substance  to  the  claim  that  the  Program  is   being  used  to  feed  industries  that  are  hungry  for  low-wage  (and  largely  non-unionized)   labour"  (Stevens,  2014,  p.9).         8.2.2.  Age.  According  to  the  regression  analysis,  age  has  a  negligible  impact  on  

low-skilled  workers  in  Canada.  Each  additional  year  of  work  represents  less  than  1%   additional  wage.92  This  is  not  surprising  since  most  workers  considered  in  this  research   (71%)  are  between  the  ages  of  25  and  54.  Theoretically,  age  has  an  effect  on  labour   market  outcomes  insofar  as  it  is  associated  with  the  capacity  to  increase  productivity.   Research  that  draws  from  several  data  sources  finds  that  although  experience  is,  by   and  large,  rewarded,  job  performance  generally  begins  to  decrease  at  about  50  years  of   age;  this  is  particularly  evident  in  jobs  that  require  problem-solving,  quick-thinking  and   adaptation-to-new-knowledge  skills.  In  jobs  where  experience  and  verbal  skills  are   relevant,  aging  workers  are  expected  to  maintain  high  productivity  (Skirbekk,  2004).     
92

While  some  low-skilled  jobs  may  reward  experience,  the  regression  model  

                                                                                                 
  Although,  as  mentioned,  seniority  may  also  influence  wages.  

221  

     

indicates  that,  if  measured  via  increments  in  age,  the  effect  is  marginal.  While  seniority   may  contribute  to  wage  increases,  other  factors  such  as  labour  market  fragility,   instability  and  high  job-rotation,  which  are  all  characteristics  of  low-skilled  jobs,  may   impede  an  increase  in  seniority.  Low-skilled  jobs  are,  by  definition,  jobs  that  require   either  high  school  or  occupation  specific  training  (jobs  in  skill  level  C)  or  on  the  job   training  (jobs  in  skill  level  D).  While  age  may  have  an  effect  at  the  moment  of  hiring,  this   effect  does  not  seem  to  have  any  permanence.  Further  studies  should  look  into  the   effect  of  job  tenure  on  wages  in  low-skilled  occupations.  Other  characteristics  like  sex   and  immigration  status  may  have  a  more  direct  effect  on  wage.         8.2.3.  Sex.  With  respect  to  wages,  our  findings  show  that  taking  all  low-skilled  

workers  across  all  occupations  into  account,  female  low-skilled  workers  earn  lower   wages  than  low-skilled  male  workers.  According  to  the  regression  models,  low-skilled   females  working  in  low-skilled  occupations  earn  14%  less  than  males  also  working  in   low-skilled  occupations.  In  Canada,  women  historically  have  earned  lower  salaries  than   men  as  reported  in  the  literature  (Baker  &  Drolet  2010;  Baker  et  al.,  1995;  Doiron  &   Riddell  1994;  Drolet  2002;  Fortin  &  Schirle  2006;  Gunderson  1979,  as  cited  in  Morisette   et  al.,  2013,  p.12).  Although  the  wage  gap  between  men  and  women  has  been   decreasing,  it  is  nevertheless  still  present.  In  1981,  the  male/female  wage  ratio  was   74%  (26%  gap).  In  2006  (the  year  of  the  census  referenced  in  this  study),  the  ratio   increased  to  about  85%  (15%  gap).  In  2011,  the  gap  has  decreased  to  13%  (Morissette   et  al.,  2013).  According  to  Stats  Canada,  women  tend  to  work  more  in  part-time  jobs   compared  to  men  and  generally  tend  to  work  fewer  hours  than  males  (Ferraro,  2010),  

222  

     

which  reduces  their  income.      Though  evident  across  the  labour  force,  the  impact  of  the  wage  gap  between  

males  and  females  is  particularly  felt  in  low-skilled  occupations,  where  a  14%  increase   in  wages  could  stand  to  improve  the  actual  wellbeing  of  an  entire  family.           8.2.4.  Province  of  Residence.  According  to  Table  12,  larger  wages  correspond  

with  larger  economies:  in  comparison  with  Quebec  (province  of  reference)  93,  working  in   Ontario  or  British  Columbia  has  a  positive  effect  on  the  wages  of  low-skilled  workers   (low-skilled  workers  in  these  provinces  earn  higher  wages  than  in  Quebec).  In  contrast,   working  in  one  of  the  smaller  provinces  has  a  negative  effect  (low-skilled  workers  in   these  provinces  earn  lower  wages  than  in  Quebec).  While  workers  in  Ontario  and  British   Columbia  earn  5.4%  and  5.9%  more,  respectively,  than  workers  in  Quebec,  workers  in   Atlantic  Canada  and  in  the  Prairie  provinces  earn  13.4%  and  4.6%  less,  respectively,   than  workers  in  Quebec.  It  is  important  to  remember  that  the  data  used  in  this  analysis   still  does  not  reflect  the  significant  increase  in  low-skilled  TFWs  these  provinces  have   had  (especially  Alberta  and  Saskatchewan),  since  this  increase  took  place  after  2006.   More  recent  data  would  perhaps  present  a  different  picture  of  low-skilled  labour  in  these   provinces.  Low-skilled  workers  employed  in  the  territories  exhibit  the  highest  wage   difference  (18.0%  more  than  in  Quebec),  which  is  in  keeping  with  the  fact  that  wages   generally  tend  to  be  higher  in  the  territories  because  of  the  scarcity  of  labour  supply.        
93

8.2.5.  Rural-  Urban  Location.  According  to  the  model,  working  in  rural  areas  

                                                                                                 
  To  identify  provincial  comparison  among  NPRs,  a  given  province  must  be  selected  as  the  point  of   comparison.  In  this  process,  Quebec  was  selected  as  the  base  comparator.  

223  

     

represents  4.2%  less  wage  than  working  in  urban  areas.  This  decrease  in  wages   confirms  the  wage-difference  that  in  many  cases  serves  as  a  motivator  for  rural  to  urban   migration  (Brueckner  &  Lall,  2015)94.  Even  though  the  wage  discrepancy  is  not  very   significant,  a  more  focused  analysis  at  the  occupation  level  may  provide  clearer   outcomes  of  rural-urban  wage  differences.  Studying  rural-urban  differences  may  yield   better  results  if  nuanced  for  certain  occupations,  since  most  occupations  are  in  urban   areas.  Effective  rural-urban  comparisons  may  take  place  in  occupations  located  in  both   rural  and  urban  settings.         8.2.6.  Level  of  Education.  Having  a  postsecondary  degree  has  a  positive  effect  

on  the  wages  of  low-skilled  workers.  Compared  to  those  with  a  high  school  degree  or   less,  having  a  college  degree  or  a  trades  certificate  represents  a  5.8%  increase  in  wage   and  having  a  university  degree  represents  an  increase  of  7.2%  (see  Table  12).   Descriptive  data  on  education  level  shows  that  the  total  low-skilled  population  with   University  degrees  working  in  low-skilled  occupations  tends  to  have  higher  average   wages  than  all  low-skilled  workers  with  college  degrees  or  trade  certificate  ($17.74/hour   and  $17.54/hour,  respectively).  Their  wage  is  also  higher  than  that  of  those  with  high   school  education  or  less  ($16.32/hour).  However,  when  the  focus  is  narrowed  down  to   each  of  the  three  populations  (CB,  IMM  and  NPR)  the  differences  vary.  On  average,   Canadian-born  employees  with  university  degrees  working  in  low-skilled  occupations   earn  about  9%  more  than  those  with  a  college  degree  or  trades  certificate  working  in   low-skilled  occupations.  When  compared  with  Canadian-born  workers  with  high  school  
                                                                                                 
94

  A  study  of  wage  differences  among  large,  middle  and  small  size  settlement  in  British  Columbia  using   1996  census  data  showed  that  income  and  labour  force  participation  tended  to  be  higher  outside  the   Vancouver  metropolitan  area  (Bauder,  2003a).  

224  

     

level  education  or  less,  Canadian-born  with  university  degrees  working  in  low-skilled   occupations  earn  about  15%  more.  For  the  immigrant  population,  these  differences   switch  to  -6%  (6%  less  wage)  and  4%.  Among  NPRs,  those  with  university  degrees   earn  an  average  of  1%  less  than  NPRs  with  trade  certificates  and  11%  less  than  NPRs   with  high  school  or  less.  Given  that  the  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  populations  are   significantly  larger,  the  general  effect  seen  in  the  regression  analysis  follows  the   patterns  found  among  the  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  populations.      While  these  results  are  relevant  and  provide  important  general  information,  these  

differences  also  need  to  be  nuanced  at  the  occupation  level,  which,  to  a  certain  extent,   is  taken  up  in  the  descriptive  analysis.  The  regression  analysis  of  certain  specific   occupations  also  sheds  some  light  on  this.         8.2.7.  First  Official  Language  Spoken.  Not  speaking  either  official  language  

has  a  negative  effect  on  wage.  Not  speaking  either  English  or  French  represents  a   12.2%  decrease  in  wage  compared  to  those  who  report  speaking  either  official   language.  This  outcome  would  also  need  to  be  nuanced  by  the  type  of  occupation.   Some  occupations,  even  if  they  are  low-skilled,  require  speaking  either  English  or   French  and  most  respondents  to  the  census  speak  either  official  language.  All   Canadian-born  citizens  (100%),  92%  of  immigrants  (including  permanent  residents)  and   88%  of  Non-Permanent  Residents  reported  speaking  either  official  language.  Besides,   most  low-skilled  workers  are  either  Canadian-born  or  immigrants  (more  than  99%)  and   less  than  1%  are  Non-Permanent  Residents.  As  a  result,  the  wage  difference  between   those  who  speak  and  those  who  do  not  speak  either  official  language  may  not  be  

225  

     

directly  related  to  speaking  the  language.  Rather,  the  difference  is  most  likely  linked  to   the  temporariness  of  NPRs'  legal  status.  Differences  may  also  be  nuanced  by  other   factors,  including  seniority.  Older  immigrants  working  in  low-skilled  occupations  tend  to   speak  non-official  languages  at  work  (Thomas,  2009).           8.2.8.  Place  of  Birth  (Region  of  the  World)95.  The  impact  that  place  of  birth  has  

on  low-skilled  workers'  wages  is  positive  if  the  workers  are  born  in  West,  North,  Central   or  Southern  Europe.  If  the  workers  are  born  anywhere  else  in  the  world  (with  statistically   significant  outcomes),  the  effect  is  negative.  According  to  the  regression  analysis,  the   wage  model  shows  that,  except  for  those  born  in  Region  9  [South  Africa,  Swaziland,   Namibia  and  Oceania]  and  Region  13  [Far  East  Asia  (Cambodia,  Vietnam,  etc.)],  all   foreign-born  individuals  exhibit  statistically  significant  differences  compared  to  those   born  in  North  America  (Canada,  United  States,  Greenland  and  St.  Pierre  et  Miquelon).   These  results  will  be  analyzed  in  the  next  chapter.        Low-skilled  workers  born  in  Latin-America  (immigrants  and  NPRs)  earn  an  

average  of  3.5%  less  than  those  born  in  North  America.  The  difference  increases  if  the   group  compared  against  low-skilled  North-Americans  are  those  born  in  Arab  countries.   Low-skilled  workers  born  in  North  Africa  and  Arab  countries  earn  9.9%  less  and  those   born  in  India  earn  15.6%  less  than  low-skilled  workers  born  in  North  America.  These   results  resonate  with  the  fact  that  India  is  the  first  source  country  of  low-skilled   immigrants  and  the  third  source  country  of  low-skilled  NPRs  (see  Table  7  in  chapter   five).

226  

     

  

At  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum,  low-skilled  workers  from  Europe  report  

earnings  higher  than  those  born  in  North  America.  Low-skilled  workers  from  region  5   (West,  North  and  Central  Europe)  earn  1.3%  higher  wages  than  low-skilled  workers   born  in  North  America.  Workers  born  in  region  7  (South  Europe  including  Spain,   Portugal  and  Italy)  earn  8.3%  higher  wages  than  low-skilled  workers  born  in  North- America.  These  results  complement  what  was  found  in  the  cross-tabulation  analysis  for   country  of  birth  (see  chapter  five).  Additionally,  the  number  of  cases  by  country  of  origin   tends  to  be  higher  among  immigrants  than  among  NPRs,  so  the  weight  is  higher  among   those  with  access  to  citizenship  than  those  without  it.           8.2.9.  Occupations.  This  section  presents  the  outcomes  for  all  low-skilled  

workers  (NPR,  CB  and  IMM  together)  working  in  all  98  occupations  included  in  this   analysis.  The  outcomes  for  all  low-skilled  occupations  examined  in  this  section,  are   found  in  appendix  14B.  Among  the  98  low-skilled  occupations  considered  in  this   analysis  (including  one  of  reference),96  36  have  a  wage  below  the  average  for  all  low- skilled  occupations  (of  which  34  are  statistically  significant).  In  contrast,  62  have  a  wage   above  the  average  (of  which  57  are  statistically  significant).        Low-skilled  workers  in  occupation  7413  -  Taxi  and  limousine  drivers  and  

chauffeurs  had  the  lowest  wage  difference  compared  to  workers  earning  the  average   wage  of  all  low-skilled  workers.  These  workers  earn  49.9%  less  than  workers  in   occupation  6663  Janitors,  caretakers  and  building  superintendents  (or  than  the  average

  Occupation  6663-Janitors,  caretakers  and  building  superintendents  was  chosen  as  the  control   occupation.  This  occupation  has  the  closest  average  hourly  wage  to  the  mean  for  all  occupations.   Contrary  to  the  cross-tabulation  analysis,  the  regression  analysis  allows  including  all  98  occupations   originally  chosen.

for  all  low-skilled  occupations).  They  are  followed  by  6474  Babysitters,  nannies  and   parents'  helpers,  whose  wage  is  41.6%  lower  than  the  average  for  all  low-skilled   occupations.  Other  occupations  worth  mentioning  are:  6621  Service  station  attendants   (31.1%  less  wage);  6452  Bartenders  (26.6%  less  wage);  8431  General  farm  workers   (25.1  %  less  wage);  6641  Food  counter  attendants,  kitchen  helpers  and  related   occupations  (23.4%  less  wage)  and  8611  Harvesting  labourers  (22.9%  less  wage).   Some  of  these  occupations  also  appeared  in  the  descriptive  analysis  (chapters  five,  six   and  seven)  among  the  ones  with  the  highest  wage  differences  between  Non-Permanent   Residents  and  Canadian-born  workers.  Most  of  these  occupations  tend  to  be  physically   demanding  (agricultural-related),  seasonal  (agricultural-related),  or  less  stable  and  more   prone  to  abuse  and  exploitation  (Babysitters,  Nannies  and  Parents'  Helpers  and   agriculture-related  occupations).      Of  the  62  occupations  that  have  average  wages  above  the  average  for  all  low-

skilled  occupations,  28  have  wages  20%  higher  than  the  average  for  all  low-skilled   occupations.  Low-skilled  workers  in  occupation  6464  Occupations  Unique  to  the  Armed   Forces  had  the  highest  positive  wage  difference  (52.1%)  compared  to  workers  earning   the  average  wage  for  all  low-skilled  workers.  They  are  followed  by  9482  Motor  vehicle   assemblers,  inspectors  and  testers  (39.1%  higher  than  the  average  wage),  and  by  1432   Payroll  clerks  (39.6%  higher).  Other  occupations  worth  mentioning  are  9424  Water  and   waste  plant  operators  (38.3%  higher);  1434  Banking,  insurance  and  other  financial   clerks  (34.8%  higher)  and  6434  Ticket  agents,  cargo  service  representatives  and   related  clerks  (except  airline)  (32.7%  higher).  It  is  also  worth  noting  that  occupations  in   this  group  (above  the  average)  tend  to  be  part  of  industries  with  secure  labour  

228  

     

conditions  (ex.  the  armed  forces)  or  in  unionized  environments  (ex.  motor  vehicle   assemblers)  or  less  physically  demanding  and  more  in  office-related  environments  (ex.   payroll  clerks).  All  these  outcomes  call  for  a  more  focalized  analysis,  an  analysis  at  the   occupation  level.      8.3.  Outcomes  Regression  Models  Type  Two  (Selected  Occupations)      Each  model  tests  whether  controlling  for  age,  sex,  immigration  status  and  

province  of  residence,  or  work  location  (rural/urban),  or  level  of  education,  or  ability  to   speak  English  or  French  or  place  of  birth,  being  a  Non-Permanent  Resident  has  a   significant  negative  impact  on  wage  compared  to  being  Canadian-born.  This  section   introduces  the  outcomes  of  the  occupation-specific  regression  analysis.  For  details  on   why  type  two  models  were  built  see  section  8.1.      A  total  of  10  models  were  built  for  nine  occupations,  one  per  occupation.  This  is  

the  case  in  all  occupations  except  302  -  6474  Babysitters,  nannies  and  parents'  helpers,   for  which  two  models  were  built,  one  for  the  whole  population  in  that  occupation  and   one  for  females  only.  The  occupations  were  chosen  according  to  their  relevance  to   NPRs,  either  because  they  have  been  amply  studied  (Babysitters  and  Nannies,  General   Farm  Workers  or  Greenhouse  Workers);  or  because  they  appear  to  have  a  significant   number  of  TFWs  (Babysitters  and  Nannies,  General  Farm  Workers  or  Greenhouse   Workers;  Food  counter  attendants,  kitchen  helpers  and  related  occupations);  or,   because  they  have  a  significant  number  of  low-skilled  workers  in  general  (with  and   without  citizenship)  (Retail);  or  because,  according  to  national  projections,  they  are   projected  to  be  in  short  supply  (Truck  Drivers,  Light  Duty  Cleaners);  or  because  they  

229  

     

have  a  pathway  to  citizenship  (Babysitters  and  Nannies,  Truck  Drivers  in  Alberta  and   BC,  Industrial  butchers  and  meat  cutters  in  Manitoba).  The  variable  "Regions  of  the   World"  is  included  in  only  one  occupation  (Retail)  because  it  has  a  sample  size  that   allows  this  variable  to  be  included  in  the  model.

Tables  13  and  14  present  the  outcomes  of  the  occupation  level  models  (five  models   in  each  table).  These  outcomes  are  relevant  because  they  provide  more  nuanced   information  on  the  effect  of  lack  of  citizenship  (as  part  of  a  set  of  intrinsic  characteristics)   on  wages  in  each  specific  occupation.  After,  the  information  in  those  tables  is  used  to   describe  the  effects  each  variable  has  on  wages.    Trends  that  repeat  across  all  models   (extracted  from  the  variables  with  statistically  significant  outcomes)  include:         8.3.1.  Effect  of  lack  of  citizenship  on  wages.  Lacking  citizenship  has  a  

negative  effect  on  wage.  This  is  evident  in  eight  of  the  nine  occupations  analyzed  in  this   section.  Lacking  citizenship  among  workers  in  occupation  6471-Visiting  homemakers,   housekeepers  and  related  occupations  represents  earning  45%  less.  This  is  the   occupation  with  the  largest  negative  effect,  followed  by  7411-Truck  drivers  (38%  less),   6641-Food  counter  attendants,  kitchen  helpers  and  related  occupation  (23%  less),   6421-Retail  salespersons  and  sales  clerks  (19%  less),  6661  Light  duty  cleaner  (15%   less)  and  8432-Nursery  and  greenhouse  workers  (14%  less).  In  occupation  9462- Industrial  Butchers  and  Meat  Cutters,  Poultry  Preparers  and  Related  Workers  a  lack  of   citizenship  had  no  statistically  significant  effect  on  wage.         8.3.2  Females'  wages  versus  males'  wages.  Females  have  lower  wages  than  

males  in  all  nine  occupations.  This  confirms  what  is  amply  reported  in  the  literature  and   will  be  explored  in  more  detail  in  the  following  chapter.  However,  the  model  for   Babysitters,  nannies  and  parents'  helpers  that  includes  both  males  and  females  does   not  account  for  the  fact  that  female  NPRs  receive  additional  compensation  (room  and  

232  

     

board).  This  is  relevant  in  this  model  because  NPR  babysitters  and  nannies  have   significant  weight  in  the  total  of  low-skilled  workers  for  this  occupation  (they  represent   more  than  one  third  of  all  babysitters  and  nannies  in  Canada).  Nonetheless,  this  does   not  affect  the  analysis  for  other  occupations  or  the  male-female  analysis  in  model  type   one  because  babysitters  and  nannies  in  the  context  of  the  whole  group  of  low-skilled   workers  in  all  immigration  categories  is  minimal.  Accounting  for  all  three  categories  (CB,   IMM  and  NPR)  babysitters  and  nannies  represent  only  0.6%  of  all  low-skilled  workers.         8.3.3  Provincial  comparison.  Compared  to  working  in  Quebec97,  working  in  

Ontario  and  British  Columbia  represents  a  positive  effect  on  wages  for  the  occupations   with  statistically  significant  outcomes.  The  exception  to  this  is  in  agriculture  occupations   in  Ontario.  8431-General  farm  workers  and  8432-Nursery  and  greenhouse  workers  has   a  negative  effect  on  wages.         8.3.4.  Working  in  rural  areas  versus  urban  areas.  Working  in  a  rural  location  

has  a  negative  effect  on  wages  compared  to  working  in  an  urban  location  in  all  six   occupations  with  statistically  significant  outcomes.  This  is  especially  apparent  among   8431-General  farm  workers  (21%  less)  and  6474-Babysitters  and  Nannies  -  Females   only  (15%  less).              8.3.5.  Level  of  education  and  wages.  Except  for  Truck  Drivers,  having  a  post-

secondary  degree  (either  a  college  degree/trades  certificate  or  a  University  degree)  has

  To  identify  provincial  comparison  among  NPRs,  models  type  two  also  required  a  given  province  to  be   selected  as  the  point  of  comparison.  In  this  process,  Quebec  was  also  sleeted  as  the  base  comparator.

a  positive  effect  on  wage.  The  effect  of  education  probably  contains  other  effects  not   accounted  for  in  the  regression  model.  For  example,  it  is  likely  that  other  attributes  such   as  experience  or  availability  are  preferred  over  education  and,  by  extension,  may   receive  a  slightly  higher  reward.  Further  research  (i.e.  other  models)  that  account  for   other  effects  not  considered  in  this  analysis  should  be  developed.         8.3.6  Effect  of  speaking  either  English  or  French  on  wages.  Not  speaking  

either  English  or  French  has  a  negative  effect  on  wages.  This  is  especially  apparent   among  workers  in  occupation  6471-Visiting  homemakers,  housekeepers  and  related   occupations  (41%  lower  wage)  and  6641-Food  counter  attendants,  kitchen  helpers  and   related  occupations  (23%  lower  wage).  India  and  the  Philippines  make  about  25%  of  all   the  foreign-born  population  in  this  occupation  (6641).  In  addition  to  those  born  in  the   Philippines,  it  is  likely  that  a  significant  number  of  Canadian-born  workers  in  this   occupation  consider  themselves  of  Filipino  ethnic  origin.  Thus,  higher  wages  are  likely   to  be  linked  to  the  fact  that  they  not  only  speak  English,  but  also  have  a  strong  presence   in  Canada.         8.3.7.  Effect  of  place  of  birth  on  wages.  The  place  of  birth  affects  wages  either  

positively  or  negatively.  Only  occupation  6421-Retail  salespersons  and  sales  clerks   allowed  this  variable  ("Regions  of  the  World")  to  be  included.  This  occupation  contains   the  highest  number  of  workers  of  all  low-skilled  occupations.  About  260  000  reported   working  in  this  occupation  in  the  2006  census.  "Regions  of  the  World"  has  statistically   significant  outcomes  in  nine  of  the  13  regions  analyzed.  Of  these  nine  regions,  only  low-

234  

     

skilled  workers  born  in  one  region  (Southern  Europe  -  Spain,  Italy,  Portugal,  etc.),   working  in  retail  had  higher  wages  than  those  also  working  in  retail  who  were  born  in   North  America  (6%).  Among  retail  workers,  the  remaining  eight  regions  all  had  negative   wage  effects  (i.e.  lower  wages  than  the  wages  of  those  born  in  North  America).  The   three  largest  negative  differences  (compared  with  those  born  in  North  America)  appears   among  those  from  South  Saharan  Africa  (14%  less),  East  Asia,  excluding  India   (Pakistan,  Bangladesh,  Nepal,  etc.),  (21%  less)  and  India  (25%  less).         8.3.8.  Effect  of  age  on  wages.  Age  has  a  marginal  effect  on  wage  (less  than  1%  

variation)  and  is  always  positive.  However,  seniority  may  affect  wages,  but  as  explained,   it  was  not  possible  to  include  this  variable  in  the  analysis.            Summary   Immigration  status  presents  the  most  striking  outcome  of  all  the  characteristics  

that  influence  hourly  wages.  Compared  to  low-skilled  Canadian-born  workers,  low- skilled  foreign-born  individuals  with  citizenship  (naturalized  immigrants)  or  the  possibility   of  acquiring  it  (permanent  residents)  earn  7%  less,  which  is  not  very  distant  from  the   wages  of  the  Canadian-born.  In  contrast,  low-skilled  workers  without  citizenship  earn   almost  20%  less  than  those  born  in  Canada.  This  means  that  for  the  most  part  having   access  to  citizenship  does  indeed  increase  the  possibility  of  earning  better  wages.   According  to  the  regression  model,  working  in  rural  areas  represents  4%  lower  wages   than  working  in  urban  areas.  The  regression  analysis  corroborates  what  has  been  found   in  the  cross-tabulation  analysis:  low-skilled  NPRs  earn  significantly  lower  wages.  

235  

     

  

When  the  focus  is  on  specific  occupations,  the  outcomes  are  even  more  striking.  

Compared  to  Canadian-born  workers,  a  lack  of  citizenship  negatively  affects  NPRs'   wages  in  the  following  occupations:  6471-Visiting  homemakers,  housekeepers  and   related  occupations  (45%  less  wage);  7411  -  Truck  drivers  (38%  less  wage);  6641  Food   counter  attendants,  kitchen  helpers  and  related  occupations  (23%  less  wage);  and,   8432  -  Nursery  and  greenhouse  workers  (14%  less  wage).  Accounting  for  whether  the   work  place  is  either  in  a  rural  or  urban  area  has  a  significant  impact  on  agricultural   occupations.  Agricultural  workers  in  occupation  8431-General  farm  workers  in  a  rural   area  earn  21%  less  than  those  in  an  urban  area.  In  occupation  6474-Babysitters,   nannies  and  parents'  helpers,  not  speaking  either  official  language  represents  a   likelihood  of  earning  29.2%  less  than  those  who  speak  either  one.      Given  the  large  amount  of  detail  presented  in  this  chapter  it  may  help  to  see  

schematically  what  its  main  finding  are.  They  are  presented  in  the  following  table  (15),   which  identifies  the  hypothesis  and  findings  explored  in  this  chapter.  For  a  summary  of   all  hypotheses  see  Appendix  16.     
Table  15:  Summary  of  Hypotheses/Chapter  Findings   Hypotheses   1.  In  the  model  for  all  occupations,  controlling  for   age,  sex,  immigration  status,  province  of   residence,  work  location  (rural/urban),  level  of   education,  ability  to  speak  English  or  French  and   place  of  birth,  being  a  NPR  has  a  significant   negative  impact  on  wages  compared  to  being   Canadian-born.   2.  In  each  occupational  level  model,  controlling  for   age,  sex,  immigration  status  and  province  of   residence,  work  location  (rural/urban),  level  of   education,  ability  to  speak  English  or  French  and   Findings   Being  a  NPR  has  a  large  negative  effect  (19%  less   wage).   Lacking  citizenship  (being  a  NPR)  had  a  significant   negative  effect  on  wage  in  eight  out  of  the  nine   occupations  with  individual  models.  Only  in   occupation  9462-Industrial  Butchers  and  Meat   Cutters,  Poultry  Preparers  and  Related  Workers,  did   being  a  NPR  have  no  statistically  significant  effect   on  wages.   Age  has  a  negligible  positive  effect  for  low-skilled   workers  in  Canada.

place  of  birth,  being  a  NPR  has  a  significant   negative  impact  on  wages  compared  to  being   Canadian-born.  

Low-skilled  female  workers  earn  lower  wages  than   low-skilled  male  workers.  According  to  the   regression  models,  low-skilled  females  working  in   low-skilled  occupations  earn  14%  less  wage  than   males.   4.1.  Province  of  Residence:  among  low-skilled   workers,  working  in  provinces  with  the  largest   economies  has  a  positive  effect  on  wages  compared   to  working  in  Quebec.  In  contrast,  working  in  smaller   provinces  has  a  negative  effect  compared  to  working   in  Quebec.   While  workers  in  Ontario  and  British  Columbia  earn   5.4%  and  5.9%  more  than  in  Quebec,  workers  in   Atlantic  Canada  and  the  Prairie  provinces  earn   13.4%  and  4.6%  less  than  in  Quebec.   4.2.  Location  of  Work  (Rural-Urban):  According  to   the  model,  working  in  rural  areas  represents  4.2%   less  than  working  in  urban  areas.   Having  a  postsecondary  degree  has  a  positive  effect   on  wages.  Compared  to  those  with  a  high  school   degree  or  less,  having  a  college  degree  or  a  trades   certificate  represents  5.8%  more  in  wages.  For   those  with  university  degrees  the  premium  rises  to   7.2%  on  hourly  wages  (see  Table  12).   Not  speaking  either  official  language  has  a  negative   effect  on  wage.  More  specifically,  not  speaking  either   English  or  French  represents  12.2%  less  in  wages   compared  to  those  who  report  speaking  either   official  language.   The  effect  of  place  of  birth  on  wages  among  low- skilled  workers  is  positive  if  the  workers  are  born  in   West,  North,  Central  or  Southern  Europe.  If  the   workers  are  born  anywhere  else  in  the  world  (with   statistically  significant  outcomes),  the  effect  is   negative.   Among  the  98  low-skilled  occupations  considered  in   this  analysis  (plus  one  for  reference),  36  have  a   wage  below  the  average  for  all  low-skilled   occupations  (34  of  which  are  statistically  significant).   In  contrast,  62  have  a  wage  above  the  average  (57   of  which  are  statistically  significant).

Chapter  Nine:  Place  of  the  Findings  in  the  Literature  
  

In  this  chapter,  I  compare  my  outcomes  against  the  outcomes  found  in  the  

literature.  I  compare  to  the  literature  to  see  whether  my  findings  contrast  or  align  with   the  literature.  As  we  will  see,  the  findings  of  this  dissertation  align  very  close  with  the   literature.  The  more  general  qualitative  work  found  in  the  literature  reinforces  the   innovative  quantitative  outcomes  of  this  dissertation.  This  review  of  the  literature  serves   to  explore  what  is  behind  wage  differences  in  relation  to  specific  occupations  (as   defined  in  this  dissertation)98  and  other  characteristics  that  influence  how  much  low- skilled  workers  earn.  This  chapter  presents  the  outcomes  (by  each  of  the  variables   analyzed)  of  the  previous  quantitative  chapters  (chapters  five,  six,  seven  and  eight)  and   explores  their  place  in  the  literature  on  low-skilled  labour  in  Canada.        I  organized  this  chapter  into  eight  sections.  In  the  first  seven  sections,  I  compare  

and  contrast  the  outcomes  for  each  of  the  variables  with  the  relevant  literature.  The   chapter  mainly  focuses  on  occupations  with  an  additional  brief  reference  to  the  top  two   industry  sectors  identified  in  the  analysis  (Healthcare  and  Social  Assistance  and   Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing  and  Hunting).  The  analysis  focuses  on  those  two   industries  because  each  contain  the  two  types  of  occupations  most  relevant  for  NPRs   identified  in  this  dissertation,  namely  Babysitters  Nannies  and  Parents'  Helpers  (mainly   included  in  Healthcare  and  Social  Assistance)  and  occupations  in  agriculture  (mainly   included  in  Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing  and  Hunting).  Literature  on  low-skilled  labour  in

    Recall  that  occupations  in  this  dissertation  follow  the  NOC  4  classification  of  occupations,  which  is  the   smallest  unit  of  classification  available  for  research  in  the  NOC  system  of  classification  of  occupations   (see  appendix  3C).  NOC4  occupations  group  different  types  of  jobs.  Ideally  it  would  have  helped  to  have   more  granular  information  (i.e.  information  about  actual  jobs),  but  it  is  not  available.  The  analysis  of  the   outcomes  in  previous  chapters  is  of  jobs  grouped  in  NOC4  occupations  (see  chapter  four  and  appendix   3C  for  detailed  explanations).     

238  

     

other  industry  sectors  is  rather  scarce.        Variables  that  are  considered  include:  industry  sectors;  occupations  (caregiving,  

agriculture  and  other  selected  low-skilled  occupations);  geography  (province  of   residence  and  rural/urban  work  location);  sex;  first  official  language  spoken;  level  of   education;  and  place  of  birth  (regions  of  the  world).  In  the  eighth  section,  I  present  the   final  considerations  of  the  chapter.  Each  section  contains  an  underlined  statement  that   highlights  the  main  trend/outcome  in  it.  All  outcomes  and  statistics  in  this  chapter  refer   to  chapter  five  (when  referring  to  outcomes  of  the  profile),  six  (when  referring  to   absolute  or  relative  wages99  by  occupation  or  industry),  seven  (when  referring  to  wage   differences  in  relation  to  intrinsic  characteristics  of  workers  and  their  occupations)  or   eight  (when  referring  to  outcomes  of  the  regression  analysis).        9.1.  Industry  Sectors  and  Occupations  ­  General  Overview        Healthcare  and  Social  Assistance  and  Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing  and  Hunting  

exhibit  the  highest  negative  differences  in  the  wages  of  low-skilled  NPRs  compared  to   their  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  counterparts.      The  literature  on  the  labour  market  and  workforce  reinforces  the  association  of  

these  two  industrial  sectors  with  low-wage  work.    An  important  component  of  the  Health   Care  and  Social  Assistance  sector  is  what  Cervena,  (2009)  calls  the  `Service  Class.'  In   her  analysis,  she  describes  this  class  as  a  group  of  "low  paying  service  jobs"  that  are   present  across  different  industries  in  Canada.  A  significant  number  of  women  work  in   this  class.  In  general,  Health  Care  and  Social  Assistance  contains  an  over- representation  of  females  with  significantly  low  wages  (Cervenan,  2009;  Ostry  &

  NPR  wages  compared  to  CB  and  IMM

Spiegel,  2004).  Cervena's  research  shows  that  across  all  industries  (including  those   with  a  small  number  of  women),  service  class  jobs  have  the  largest  male  to  female   wage  gap  (Cervena,  2009).  Although  most  TFWs  working  in  occupational  group100   6474-Babysitters  and  Nannies  and  Parents'  Helpers  are  classified  within  the  "Other   services"  category  (which  is  not  a  sector  per  se),  the  highest  proportion  of  TFWs  in  the   Health  Care  and  Social  Assistance  (45%)  are  babysitters  and  nannies.  Research   suggests  that  low  wages  and  precariousness  in  the  healthcare  sector  are  on  the  rise   (Ostry  &  Spiegel,  2004).  After  the  rapid  expansion  of  globalization  in  the  1970s,  the   service  sector  in  first  world  countries  have  faced  "high  unemployment,  increased  skill   requirements  for  most  jobs,  and  a  rise  in  non-traditional  work  arrangements"  (Ostry  &   Spiegel,  2004,  p.368).  Downsizing  the  healthcare  sector  in  the  1990s  in  countries   including  Canada  led  to  detriments  in  general  working  conditions  (Ostry  &  Spiegel,   2004).      The  second  sector  identified  for  its  high  negative  difference  in  the  wages  of  low-

skilled  NPRs  compared  to  their  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  counterparts  is   Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing  and  Hunting.  These  quantified  wage  discrepancies  add   further  testimony  to  research  that  shows  the  incidence  of  low  wages  among  low-skilled   temporary  foreign  workers  in  the  agro-business  (Basok,  2000a;  Preibisch,  2004;   Sharma,  2001).  According  to  Employment  and  Social  Development  Canada  (ESDC),   this  sector  contains  the  largest  number  of  temporary  foreign  worker  positions  with   (approved)  labour  market  impact  assessments  (LMIAs)101  (ESDC,  2016f).  Not  only  is  it

  Note  that  the  term  "occupational  group"  and  the  word  "occupation"  are  equally  used     For  a  definition  of  LMIA,  see  footnote  24  in  chapter  two.  The  statistic  presented  here  corresponds  with   counts  made  after  the  policy  changes  of  June  2014.  After  these  changes,  the  LMO  (Labour  Market   Opinion)  was  renamed  Labour  Market  Impact  Assessment  (LMIA)  and  the  program  was  divided  into  

240  

     

the  industry  sector  with  the  largest  number  of  TFWs,  but  the  number  continues  to  grow.   Between  2009  and  2012  this  sector  exhibited  a  9.5%  increase  in  the  number  of  positive   LMOs  from  35  967  in  2009  to  39  414  in  2012  (ESDC,  2016f).  While  these  sectors   exhibit  wage  differences  between  Canadian-born  workers  and  NPRs,  it  is  important  to   note  that  such  information  is  gathered  from  very  diverse  occupational  groups.  As  a   result,  an  industry  sectors  analysis  provides  only  an  approximate  picture.  To  gain  insight   into  wage  differences  between  those  with  and  without  citizenship,  it  is  therefore   important  to  complement  an  industry  sector  analysis  with  an  analysis  focussed  on   occupational  groups.        Although  low-skilled  NPRs  earn  lower  wages  than  CB  and  IMM  in  almost  all  

occupations,  a  lack  of  citizenship  affects  workers  in  different  occupations  differently.   Caregiving  and  agricultural  occupations  stand  out  for  their  large  wage  differences   between  NPRs  and  CB  and  IMM.  The  specific  occupations  worth  highlighting  are:   Caregiving:   1.   6474-Babysitters,  nannies  and  parents'  helpers;   2.   6471-Visiting  homemakers,  housekeepers  and  related  occupations.      Agriculture:   3.   8431-General  farm  workers;   4.   8432-Nursery  and  greenhouse  workers;   Other  occupations  stood  out  not  for  their  wage  differences  but  for  the  concentration   of  a  significant  number  of  NPRs  around  low  wages.  Occupations  worth  highlighting  in  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Temporary  Foreign  Worker  Program  (those  needing  LMIA)  and  International  Mobility  Program  (those  not   needing  LMIA).

this  category  are:   5.   6641-Food  counter  attendants,  kitchen  helpers  and  related  occupations;   6.   6453-Food  and  beverage  servers.     Truck  driving  presented  a  special  case  because  this  occupation  exhibited  polarized   outcomes  in  the  quartile  analysis  but  a  positive  wage  difference  overall.  Slightly  more   than  half  of  NPRs  had  wages  above  those  of  CB  and  IMM.  The  other  half  had  very  low   wages.  However,  wage  differences  for  the  whole  NPR  population  (compared  to  CB  and   IMM)  were  positive.     These  results  are  in  keeping  with  the  evolution  of  temporary  foreign  labour  policies   in  Canada  presented  in  chapter  three.  Thus,  three  distinct  groups  of  occupations  have   been  identified  for  closer  analysis  because  they  have  significant  numbers  of  NPRs   earning  wages  significantly  lower  than  those  of  Canadian-born  workers  and  immigrants.   The  groups  are:  occupations  in  caregiving,  in  agriculture  and  in  other  selected   occupations  including:  6453-Food  and  beverage  servers;  7411-Truck  Drivers;  6641- Food  counter  attendants,  kitchen  helpers  and  related  occupations;  6661-Light  duty   cleaners;  9482-Motor  Vehicle  Assemblers;  6661-Light  duty  cleaners;  and  6421-Retail   salespersons  and  sales  clerks.         9.1.1.  Caregiving  occupations.  The  outcomes  of  this  dissertation  show  that  

when  room  and  board  is  not  accounted  for,  NPRs  in  occupation  6474-Babysitters,   Nannies  and  Parents'  Helpers  had  the  lowest  wages  and  had  significantly  large  wage   differences  in  comparison  with  CB  and  IMM.  When  room  and  board  is  accounted  for,   differences  with  the  CB  and  IMM  decrease  but  remain  negative  (i.e.  NPRs  still  earn  less  

242  

     

than  CB  and  IMM).  NPR  6474-Babysitters  and  Nannies  and  6471-Visiting  Homemakers   and  Housekeepers  were  among  the  top  six  occupations  with  negative  wage  differences   for  NPRs  compared  to  CB  and  IMM  when  room  and  board  is  not  accounted  for  (see   Appendix  10B).  Research  shows  that,  of  all  temporary  foreign  workers  in  Canada,  those   categorized  under  "Babysitters,  Nannies  and  Parents'  Helpers"  ­  approximately  57%  of   all  workers  in  the  early  childhood  education  workforce  (Beach  &  Costigliola,  2005)  ­  had   the  lowest  average  wage  of  all  Non-Permanent  Residents  (Fudge,  2012)102.  Accounting   for  room  and  board  ($2.07/hour),103  wage  increases  from  an  average  of  $8.10/hour  to   $10.17/hour  (with  a  private  room).  Wage  differences  reduce  from  31%  less  (NPRs   compared  to  the  CB)  and  29%  less  (NPRs  compared  to  IMM)  to  8%  and  6%  less   respectively.  Research  shows  that  caregivers  purportedly  earn  an  average  of   $10.25/hour,  with  a  maximum  reported  wage  of  $11.05/hour;  many  caregivers  have   themselves  reported  being  paid  between  only  $1  000  and  $1  300  a  month  regardless  of   the  number  of  hours  worked,  although  they  report  working  about  60  hours  per  week   (Faraday,  2014).  The  monthly  wages  reported  by  Faraday  will  be  equivalent  to  between   $6.25/hour  to  $8.13/hour  (with  an  average  of  40  hours/week  or  160  hours/month),  or   between  $4.16/hour  to  $5.41/hour  (with  an  average  of  60  hours/week  or  240   hours/month).  These  values  echo  the  average  wage  for  the  lowest  wage-range  quartile   for  babysitters  and  nannies  in  this  research  ($5.01/hour  -  not  including  room  and  board),   which  gathers  39%  of  all  NPR  babysitters  and  nannies,  (see  Table  8  in  chapter  six).      Research  also  indicates  that  differences  in  wages  among  workers  in  domestic

  Fudge's  information  was  also  extracted  from  the  2006  Census.     As  seen  in  chapter  six,  $2.07=  $85.25  per  week/41.17  hours  per  week,  where  $85.25  per  week  is  the   amount  employers  are  allowed  to  deduct  for  room  and  board,  and  41.17  hours  per  week  is  the  average   number  of  hours  worked  by  babysitters  and  nannies  in  the  2006  census.

labour  can  partially  be  explained  when  accounting  for  whether  or  not  the  work  is  carried   out  in  a  "live-in"  workplace.  In  2006,  close  to  33%  of  NPRs,  7%  of  CB  and  5%  of   established  immigrants  in  domestic-related  occupations  were  living  in  their  workplace104   (Thomas,  2010),  a  situation  of  considerable  vulnerability,  in  which  workers  are   frequently  victims  of  unpaid  overtime  (Bakan  &  Stasiulis,  1997).  Compounding  the  fact   that  live-in  caregivers  are  the  lowest  registered  earners  (undocumented  workers  may   earn  even  lower  wages),  is  the  fact  that  they  often  have  significant  expenses.  Research   from  1998  indicates  that  landing  costs  (including  recruiting  fees)  could  be  as  high  as   CDN  $8  300  (Grandea  &  Kerr,  1998).  Just  accounting  for  price  indexation,  those  costs   would  be  significantly  higher  now  (35.3%  or  $2  929  higher).105      In  general,  low  wages  among  babysitters  and  nannies  may  be  associated  with  a  

low  value  attached  to  domestic  labour  and  child-rearing.  Significant  opportunity  costs   linked  to  child-rearing  ­  calculated  in  terms  of  unearned  income  ­  create  an  incentive   for  parents  not  only  to  outsource  child  care,  but  also  to  find  affordable  child  care  (i.e.  to   pay  less  for  child  care  than  they  can  earn).  Calculations  for  Australian  women,  for   example,  show  that  the  total  life  earnings  of  women  with  secondary  education  are   reduced  by  approximately160  000  dollars  when  they  care  for  one  child,  and  is  reduced   even  more  for  additional  children  (Chapman,  Dunlop,  Gray  &  Liu,  2001).  In  Canada,   access  to  a  vast  global  market  of  temporary  and  cheap  labour  is  also  driving  forces   behind  the  low  wages  associated  with  these  occupations.  In  other  words,  temporary   foreign  workers  enable  the  undervaluation  of  child-care.  This  pattern  is  not  exclusive  to   caregivers,  but  is  also  found  in  agricultural  occupations  and  all  other  temporary  low-

  Other  NPRs  in  non-domestic-related  occupations,  such  as  those  working  in  agriculture,  also  live  with   their  employers  (Faraday,  2012a).     105   Statistics  Canada  Consumer  Price  Index  1996-2015.

skilled  occupations.         9.1.2.  Agricultural  occupations.  NPR  Agricultural  workers  in  occupations  8431-

General  farm  workers,  8432-Nursery  and  greenhouse  workers  and  8611-Harvesting   labourers  had  significantly  large  wage  differences  compared  to  CB  and  IMM.  At  the  time   of  the  2006  census,  in  May  2006,  SWAP  workers  were  purportedly  paid  according  to  the   "provincial  statutory  minimum  wage,  the  rate  determined  annually  by  HRSDC  to  be  the   prevailing  wage  rate  for  the  type  of  agricultural  work  being  carried  out  by  the  worker  in   the  province  in  which  the  work  will  be  done;  or,  the  rate  being  paid  by  the  employer  to   his  Canadian  workers  performing  the  same  type  of  agricultural  work"  (Verma,  2002,   p.11).  Currently,  according  to  Employment  and  Social  Development  Canada  (ESDC),   TFWs  are  paid  at  the  "the  prevailing  wage  rate  [which]  is  identified  as  the  median  hourly   wage  (or  annual  salary  as  published  on  Job  Bank)  or  higher  for  the  particular   occupation  and  work  location"  (ESDC,  2016g).  In  addition  to  having  the  same  negative   wage  outcomes  (as  shown  in  previous  chapters)  generally  associated  with  temporary   labour,  program  fees  and  deductions  specifically  applied  to  agricultural  workers  further   reduce  agricultural  workers'  wages.  For  example,  while  employers  pay  a  visa   processing  fee  of  $150  upfront  for  each  worker,  this  fee  is  later  recovered  via   deductions  from  each  worker's  paycheck;  Mexican  workers  get  5%  of  their  income   deducted  to  cover  transportation  fees;  and  workers  contribute  to  the  Canadian  Pension   Plan,  Employment  Insurance  and  all  due  taxes  (Hennebry  &  Preibisch,  2012).  While   some  agricultural  workers  in  Ontario  "earn  slightly  above  the  Ontario  minimum  wage,  a   quarter  of  their  salary  is  taken  by  income  tax,  C.P.P.,  E.I.  and  other  costs  associated  

245  

     

with  their  transportation"  (Brem,  2006;  Faraday,  2012  as  cited  in  Saez,  2013,  p.35).      On  top  of  earning  low  wages  and  having  to  pay  taxes,  program-related  fees  and  

general  labour  fees,  the  net  income  of  some  agricultural  workers  is  further  reduced  by   mandatory  savings  schemes.  For  example,  before  the  practice  was  eliminated  in  mid- 2015  (Faraday,  2016),  Caribbean  workers  often  saw  their  paycheques  reduced  by  25%   under  the  pretence  of  helping  them  save  money  for  when  they  return.  However,  when   they  returned  to  their  countries  of  origin,  they  were  reimbursed  only  19%  and  "the   remaining  six  percent  [was  used  to  help]  fund  the  government  agents  stationed  in   Canada"  (Hennebry  &  Preibisch,  2012,  p.32).  Not  surprisingly,  workers  expressed  their   preference  for  having  the  freedom  to  save  the  money  that  they  earn  as  they  please   (Hennebry  &  Preibisch  2012).      A  recent  report  from  the  Conference  Board  of  Canada  shows  that  labour  

demands  in  agriculture  have  doubled  and  are  currently  estimated  at  59  200  people,   which  is  expected  to  double  again  in  2025  to  113  800  (Conference  Board  of  Canada,   2016).  The  report  also  indicates  that  these  demands  have  resulted  in  the  sector's  heavy   reliance  on  temporary  foreign  labour:  currently  1  out  of  every  10  agricultural  workers  is  a   temporary  foreign  worker.  Some  of  the  factors  contributing  to  labour  shortages  in  the   agricultural  sector  include  an  aging  workforce,  the  rural  location  of  farm  work,  and   negative  perceptions  about  agricultural  work  (Conference  Board  of  Canada,  2016).   Such  labour  shortages,  in  turn,  demand  of  those  who  do  work,  to  work  longer  hours.  On   average,  workers  in  agriculture  work  longer  (approximately  44.8  hours  per  week)  than   the  average  in  all  other  sectors  (approximately  35.9  hours)  (Conference  Board  of   Canada,  2016).  These  findings  are  significant  because  they  demonstrate  the  ways  in  

246  

     

which  longer  hours  in  the  agriculture  sector  can  be  attributed  to  labour  shortages.        The  report  also  addresses  the  wage  gap  that  exists  between  the  agricultural  

sector  and  other  low-skilled  occupations  and  the  declining  number  of  Canadian  workers   in  this  sector.  Wages  in  agriculture  are  below  the  average  wages  provided  in  other   sectors  ($684/week  compared  to  $923/week).  Although  the  gap  has  been  closing  over   time  "with  agricultural  wages  rising  from  two  thirds  (about  66%)  of  the  average  for  all   sectors  in  2000  to  74  per  cent  in  2015"  (Conference  Board  of  Canada,  2016),  the   number  of  Canadian  workers  willing  to  work  in  this  sector  continues  to  decline.        One  of  the  major  disincentives  to  working  in  agriculture  is  the  significant  labour  

fluctuations  in  this  sector  (they  are  the  highest  of  any  major  sector).  That  is,  while  hours   of  work  in  the  agricultural  business  tend  to  be  long,  they  are  also  seasonal  (Conference   Board  of  Canada,  2016).  At  the  seasonal  peak,  employment  is  30%  above  the  seasonal   low:  "the  sector's  demand  for  labour  is  heavily  influenced  by  the  seasonal  changes  in   Canada's  climate,  with  agriculture  employing  more  than  100  000  additional  people  in   the  peak  summer  months  compared  with  the  winter  low  period"  (Conference  Board  of   Canada,  2016,  p.8).      Highlighting  how  underpaid  the  agriculture  sector  is,  the  Conference  Board  of  

Canada  compares  it  with  construction,  which  is  also  a  seasonal  occupation,  where   average  weekly  wages  are  $1  137/week.  If  the  agriculture  sector  were  to  provide  the   same  wages  as  the  construction  sector,  this  would  imply  a  66%  increase  in  wages,   which  is  simply  not  feasible.  Such  an  increase  would  make  Canadian  farms  completely   uncompetitive  on  the  market,  where  prices  are  regulated  by  regional  and  global   markets)  (Conference  Board  of  Canada,  2016).  

247  

     

  

Due  to  the  difficulty  in  securing  Canadian  workers,  over  the  past  50  years,  

employers  in  the  agricultural  sector,  especially  in  Ontario,  have  become  accustomed  to   meeting  labour  demands  with  a  foreign  labour  force.  The  long-term  use  of  this  practice   has  contributed  to  its  normalization.  In  Canada,  agriculture  "has  arisen  as  a  low-wage   labour  market  segment,  where  employers  rely  more  upon  Mexican  workers  than   resident  workers.  This  has  suppressed  wages,  weakened  health  and  safety  protections   and  permitted  the  workforce  to  become  marginalized  both  in  the  labour  market  and  the   communities  in  which  they  live"  (Foster,  2012,  p.40).  Low  prices  of  agriculture  in  the   United  States,  enabled  by  the  hiring  of  undocumented  workers,  may  also  drive  in  part   this  practice  in  Canada.  The  American  Farm  Bureau  Federation  estimates  "that  between   half  and  three-quarters  of  farm  labourers  are  unauthorized  workers  in  the  United  States"   (Conference  Board  of  Canada,  2016,  p.11)  who  may  be  paid  even  lower  wages  than   TFWs  in  Canada.         9.1.3.  Other  selected  low-skilled  occupations.  Workers  in  occupations  9482-

Motor  Vehicle  Assemblers  and  7411-Truck  Drivers  had  the  largest  wage-discrepancies   (the  former  negative  and  the  latter  positive).  While  literature  pertaining  to  the  wages  of   caregivers  and  agricultural  workers  is  prolific,  secondary  sources  on  other  low-skilled   workers  is  relatively  sparse.  This  section  focuses  on  the  general  outcomes  of  two  other   occupations:  9482-Motor  Vehicle  Assemblers,  because  it  was  affected  by  changes  in   the  economy  at  the  time  of  the  2006  census,  and  7411-Truck  Drivers,  because  it   displays  a  non-wage  related  scarcity  of  labour.      Statistics  Canada  reports  that  between  2001  and  2006,  motor  vehicle  

248  

     

assemblers  experienced  significant  job  losses,  the  majority  of  which  were  in  the  middle   to  lower  end  of  the  pay  range  (Lin,  2008).  As  with  other  occupational  groups,  occupation   9482-Motor  Vehicle  Assemblers,  Inspectors  and  Testers  refers  to  a  considerable   number  of  various  job  titles.  According  to  ESDC  (2016h),  this  occupational  group   includes  more  than  190  job  titles  in  the  2011  NOC  classification.  Of  all  workers  in  this   occupational  group  (9482-Motor  Vehicle  Assemblers,  Inspectors  and  Testers  in  2006   about  55  000  workers),  less  than  0.5%  were  NPRs.  Although  the  number  of  foreign   workers  is  small  (about  275  reported  in  the  census  after  the  population  selection  for  this   research106)  and  the  wage  dispersion  may  be  significant,  the  wage  differences  between   NPRs  and  CB  and  IMM  is  nevertheless  striking.      While  NPRs  exhibited  lower  wages  than  CB  and  IMM  in  a  significant  number  of  

occupations,  there  were  some  occupations  with  the  opposite  outcome.  At  least  four   occupations  exhibited  positive  differences  (i.e.  higher  wages  among  the  NPR  population   vis-à-vis  the  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  populations),  one  of  which  is  7411-Truck   Drivers107.  These  positive  differences  may  be  an  indication  of  tightness  between  supply   and  demand  in  the  labour  market.  Other  factors  that  may  drive  these  differences   include:  regional  differences  in  wages  and  wage  dispersion  caused  by  cases  with  very   high  wages.  In  the  case  of  NOC  7411-Truck  drivers,  wage  dispersion  is  a  significant   factor  behind  these  differences.  Truck  drivers'  wages  in  British  Colombia,  for  example,   range  between  $18/hour  and  $39/hour  (ESDC,  2017).  Accounting  for  this  wide  wage

  See  chapter  four.     Labour  shortages  in  Alberta  (north  of  Alberta)  may  be  a  possible  explanation  for  this  anomaly  (high   wages  among  the  truck  drivers  in  the  fourth  quartile).  It  may  be  likely  that  a  few  of  those  reporting  high   wages  were  recruited  to  supply  labour  needs  in  the  north  of  Alberta,  which,  at  the  time  of  the  2006   Census  was  an  area  with  high  cost  of  living.  If  that  is  the  case,  they  were  able  to  command  a  premium   wage,  but  it  should  not  be  forgotten  that  they  found  themselves  in  a  great  cost  of  living  location.  I   attempted  to  explore  this  through  my  research;  the  data  did  not  permit  that  level  of  analysis.

dispersion,  there  are  more  than  61  types  of  jobs  grouped  together  in  this  single   occupation,  each  requiring  different  types  of  skills  and  expertise.  These  jobs  range  from   "automobile  carrier  driver"  to  "fuel  oil  truck  driver"  and  "log  hauler."        A  quartile  analysis  for  truck  drivers  reveals  that  NPRs  with  wages  in  the  second  

and  third  quartiles  have  average  wages  below  those  of  Canadian-born  (39%  lower)  and   immigrant  (37%  lower)  workers  (see  appendix  9).  In  contrast,  NPRs  in  the  fourth   quartile  earn  an  average  of  15%  more  than  CB  and  the  number  of  NPRs  in  the  fourth   quartile  is  higher  than  the  number  of  NPRs  in  the  first,  second,  and  third  quartiles  put   together.  This  explains  why  wages  in  the  fourth  quartile  inflate  the  average  for  the  entire   NPR  population  in  this  occupation,  and  make  the  differences  positive.  In  this  case,  the   wage  dispersion  caused  by  a  wide  diversity  of  jobs  explains  why  the  average   differences  are  positive  for  the  whole  sample  and  negative  for  the  central  (second  and   third)  quartiles.      In  the  trucking  sector,  an  overall  increase  (of  approximately  4.9%)  in  wages  

during  the  years  prior  to  the  census,  along  with  the  revaluation  of  the  Canadian   currency  and  rising  prices  of  crude  oil,  was  a  significant  contributing  factor  to  the  overall   increase  in  operating  costs  (Transport  Canada,  2005).  According  to  Transport  Canada   (2005),  the  wage  increase  between  2003  and  2005  was  driven  by  driver  shortages.  This   reported  labour  shortage  may  also  help  explain  the  relatively  high  wages  among  NPRs   (compared  to  CB  and  IMM)  documented  by  this  research.  That  said,  future  longitudinal   studies  examining  changes  in  these  occupations  in  different  census  years  will  help  shed   light  on  whether  this  pattern  repeats  over  time.      Note  that  occupations  6453-Food  and  beverage  servers  and  6641-Food  counter  

250  

     

attendants,  kitchen  helpers  and  related  occupations  are  also  noteworthy  because  they   concentrate  a  significant  number  of  workers  around  very  low  wages.  These  occupations   are  referred  to  in  sections  three  (province  of  residence,  for  occupation  6453),  five  (first   official  language  spoken),  and  seven  (country  of  birth,  for  occupation  6641).      9.2.  Geography  (Province  of  Residence  and  Rural/Urban  Work  Location)      Ontario  and  Quebec  are  the  provinces  with  the  largest  wage  differences  (NPRs  

wages  compared  to  the  CB  and  IMM),  found      primarily  in  agriculture  and  caregiving.   These  occupations  also  displayed  significant  differences  in  rural  and  urban  contexts.   The  provincial  analysis  reinforces  the  trend  of  NPRs  earning  lower  wages  than  their   Canadian-born  and  immigrant  counterparts.  While  Ontario  had  the  largest  net  increase   in  TFWs  during  the  last  decades,  Alberta  had  the  most  rapid  increase.  Between  1998   and  2008,  Ontario  exhibited  a  128%  (or  37  575)  increase  in  the  number  of  temporary   foreign  worker  initial  entries;  British  Columbia  a  289%  (or  34  890)  increase;  and  Alberta   a  433%  (or  39  890)  increase  (CIC,  Facts  and  Figures,  2007  as  cited  in  Fudge  &   MacPhail,  2009).      In  this  dissertation  the  same  criteria  for  examining  wage  differences  was  used  for  

both  the  entire  population  and  at  the  provincial  level:  that  is,  1)  the  research  only   considered  occupations  with  a  sufficient  number  of  NPRs  to  enable  wage  comparisons   with  CB  and  IMM;  and,  2)  only  differences  with  statistically  significant  values  were   included.  Based  on  this  method,  Ontario  tended  to  have  the  greatest  number  of   negative  differences  (i.e.  the  greatest  number  of  NPRs  exhibiting  lower  wages  than  CB   and  IMM).  These  negative  differences  are  especially  evident  in  occupations  6474-  

251  

     

Babysitters,  nannies  and  parents'  helpers  (34%  lower  in  Ontario;  26%  in  Quebec;  25%   in  Alberta;  and  20%  in  BC)  and  8431-General  Farm  Workers  (20%  lower  in  Ontario  and   9%  in  Quebec).  The  proportion  of  workers  in  those  occupations  is  significantly  high  in   Ontario  (compared  to  the  other  provinces).  While  Quebec  employs  10%  of  all  NPRs  in   in  occupation  6474  Babysitters,  Nannies  and  Parents'  Helpers,  Alberta  16%,  and  British   Columbia  21%,  Ontario  employs  49%  of  all  NPRs  in  that  occupation.  Concentration  is   even  higher  among  workers  in  occupation  8431-General  farm  workers:  whereas   Quebec  employs  12%  of  all  NPRs  in  that  occupation,  Ontario  employs  81%.        As  a  result  of  their  very  distinct  economies,  provinces  exhibit  differences  in  

wages  and  in  employment  and  unemployment  rates.  Even  regional  analyses  within   provinces  show  differences  in  employment  and  unemployment  trends.  For  example,  the   Ontario  Chamber  of  Commerce's  2017  Economic  Outlook  presents  11  economic   regions  in  Ontario  with  unemployment  rates  varying  from  4.2%  in  the  Stratford/Bruce   Peninsula  to  7.5%  in  Northwest  Ontario  (Ontario  Chamber  of  Commerce,  2017).  The   wage  for  a  specific  occupation  in  rural  Northern  Ontario,  for  example,  can  vary   significantly  in  comparison  with  the  wage  for  the  same  occupation  in  Toronto,  the  urban   capital  of  Ontario.      In  contrast,  differences  related  to  immigration  status  have  characteristics  that  

replicate  across  provinces  and  territories.  In  this  case,  wage  differences  are  linked  not   to  an  actual  tightness  between  demand  and  supply  but  rather  to  actually  lower  wages   among  TFWs  (Preibisch  &  Binford,  2007)  or  other  factors  linked  to  exploitation,   including  unpaid  wages  and  overtime  hours  (Fudge  &  MacPhail,  2009).  Officials  in   Alberta,  for  example,  discovered  an  employment  agency  that  did  not  pay  wages  to  at  

252  

     

least  132  workers  between  April  and  July  of  2007  (Fudge  &  MacPhail,  2009).   Inspections  also  revealed  that  74%  of  Albertan  employers  with  TFWs  had  not  abided  by   employment  standards,  with  one  of  the  most  frequent  breaches  being  unpaid  statutory   holidays  (Foster,  2012).  Other  research  shows  that  about  43%  of  TFWs  never  received   overtime  payment  (Walsh,  2014).        Tracing  the  changes  in  wages  across  occupations  and  industries  brings  some  

clarity  to  the  dynamics  between  supply  and  demand  in  the  labour  market.  If  there  was   no  access  to  foreign  labour,  wages  in  occupations  under  economic  pressure  would  tend   to  increase.  However,  "the  fact  that  the  wages  of  most  of  the  occupations  under   pressure  in  Alberta  and  British  Columbia  had  not  increased  more  than  the  wages  in   other  occupations  suggests  that  the  low-skilled  streams  of  the  TFWP  operate  as  a   device  to  regulate  the  Canadian  labour  market  by  lowering  wages  and  conditions  of   employment"  (Fudge  &  MacPhail,  2009,  p.43).  While  the  TFW  program  is  supposed  to   supply  labour  needs  in  regions  where  there  is  scarcity,  in  reality  it  "distorts  regional   labour  market  patterns  by  suppressing  inter-regional  labour  mobility  from  provinces  of   higher  unemployment  to  areas  of  low  unemployment"  (Gross  &  Schmitt  2010;  Gross   2010,  as  cited  in  Foster,  2012  p.39).      Occupation  6453-Food  and  beverage  servers  exhibits  a  significant  number  of  

NPRs  concentrated  around  a  very  low  wage.  British  Columbia  reported  significant  wage   differences  in  this  occupation.  The  2002  report  on  the  tourism  sector  in  British  Columbia   shows  this  occupation  has  the  highest  number  of  employees  of  all  occupations  in  this   industry  (CS/Resors  Ltd.,  Bird  &  Emery,  2002).  Most  of  them  were  female  (78%)  and   most  of  them  had  high  school  education  or  below  (43%)  (Bird  and  Emery,  2002).  This  

253  

     

occupation  exhibited  the  second  lowest  income,  $9  753/year  (after  6641-Food  counter   attendants,  kitchen  helpers  and  related  occupations,  who  had  the  lowest  average   income:  $6  987/year).  The  report  also  showed  a  1.4%  expected  growth  between  2000   and  2010,  which  as  an  average  growth  compared  to  other  occupations  in  this  industry   (CS/Resors  et  al.,  2002).  The  significant  negative  wage  differences  between  Canadian- born  and  NPR  workers  introduce  the  potential  to  use  a  workers'  lack  of  citizenship  as  a   means  for  even  lower-wage  labour.  This  case  study  in  BC  is  reflective  of  the  use  of  TFW   labour  in  Canada.      New  Brunswick  has  also  followed  the  upward  trend  of  TFWs  exhibited  in  other  

provinces.  Most  temporary  foreign  labour  in  New  Brunswick  is  considered  to  be  low- wage.  Some  of  these  workers  come  to  fill  gaps  in  the  fish  and  seafood  processing   sector,  which  is  another  sector  of  the  economy  requiring  seasonal  labour  (Thomas  &   Belkhodja,  2014).  Labour  needs  in  New  Brunswick  and  the  use  of  foreign  labour  collides   with  some  demographic  challenges:  a  scarcity  of  jobs  with  wages  above  minimum  wage   or  requiring  high  skills,  are  driving  youth  away  from  rural  areas  and  away  from  the   province.  It  has  also  been  argued  that  this  relatively  recent  access  to  cheaper  labour   does  not  provide  an  incentive  for  employers  to  find  other  ways  to  hire  Canadians,  such   as  by  increasing  wages  or  improving  labour  conditions  (Thomas  &  Belkhodja,  2014).      Some  communities,  for  example,  Brandon,  Manitoba,  have  been  proactive  in  

attracting  and  retaining  immigrants  (Palacio,  2010).  Many  workers  coming  to  Manitoba,   in  butchering,  meat-  packing  and  food  processing  occupations,  come  to  Canada  initially   as  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  workers  who  later  transition  into  permanent  residents   (Palacio,  2010).  The  University  of  Brandon  has  documented  strategies  to  retain  

254  

     

immigrants  from  the  perspectives  of  both  employers  and  employees  in  small-  and   medium-size  food  processing  businesses  in  rural  Manitoba.  A  combination  between   competitive  compensation  and  fair  workplace  treatment  were  found  as  the  most   effective  means  for  retention  (Ashton  &  Wayne,  2013).  According  to  workers,  although   wage  is  the  most  significant  element  to  decide  whether  to  stay  in  a  job  in  a  small,  rural   community,  other  factors,  including  the  way  they  are  treated,  are  also  important   considerations  in  the  decision-making  process  (Ashton  &  Wayne,  2013).      9.3.  Sex      Two  types  of  comparison  for  the  variable  "sex"  took  place:  1)  a  comparison  within  

each  category  (male  and  female)  by  immigration  status  in  the  cross-tabulation  analysis   and  2)  the  influence  on  wages  of  being  female  (compared  to  being  male)  in  the   regression  analysis.  The  cross-tabulation  analysis  for  sex  in  chapter  seven  showed  that,   both  NPR  men  and  women  earn  less  than  their  CB  and  IMM  counterparts.  Such  wage   differences  are  most  prominent  for  both  males  and  females  in  occupation  6476-  visiting   homemakers,  housekeepers  and  related  occupations;  male  NPRs  in  agricultural   occupations  also  exhibit  significantly  negative  wage  differences  compared  to  male  CB   and  male  IMM.  The  regression  analysis  in  chapter  eight  showed  that,  males  earn  more   than  females.  Workers'  sex  represents  another  characteristic  that  relativizes  migrant   labour  and  wage  differences  in  Canada.  Differences  in  wages  by  sex  and  immigration   status  replicate  the  pattern  seen  for  the  whole  population  in  each  occupation.  As   detailed  in  chapter  seven,  NPR  women  tend  to  earn  lower  wages  than  Canadian-born   and  immigrant  women.  A  similar  pattern  is  also  evident  among  men,  although  to  a  lesser  

255  

     

degree.      The  regression  analysis  showed  that,  accounting  for  all  low-skilled  workers  in  all  

98  low-skilled  occupations  in  this  research,  low-skilled  females  earned  14.2%  less  than   low-skilled  males  (see  Table  12  in  chapter  eight).  Wage  differences  between  the  sexes   are  linked  to  a  long  history  of  male  hegemony.  Although  such  disparity  has  decreased  in   most  developed  nations,  it  nevertheless  persists.  In  Canada,  females  earn  about  0.8   dollars  for  every  dollar  that  males  earn  working  in  similar  occupations  (Stats  Canada,   2016b).  Ontario  has  been  working  on  reducing  the  wage  gap,  although  differences   remain  significant.  In  April  2015,  the  Ontario  government  appointed  a  steering   committee  to  develop  a  wage  gap  strategy  (Ontario  Government  ­  Ministry  of  labour,   2015)  and  the  committee  is  expected  to  report  back  to  the  government  in  early  2016.      In  some  sectors  of  the  economy  the  labour  force  tends  to  be  predominantly  male.  

According  to  the  2006  census,  of  45  000  agricultural  workers  in  the  three  occupational   groups  that  rely  most  on  low-skilled  TFWs  (8431-General  farm  workers,  8432-Nursery   and  greenhouse  workers  and  8611-Harvesting  labourers),  about  34%  were  females  and   66%  were  males.  These  ratios,  however,  vary  significantly  when  accounting  for  legal   status.  There  were  31%  females  and  69%  males  among  Canadian-born  workers;  51%   females  and  49%  males  among  immigrants;  and  6%  females  and  94%  males  among   NPRs.  While  TFW  males  are  overrepresented  in  the  agricultural  sector,  there  is  a  great   predominance  of  females  in  the  caregiving  sector,  which  illustrates  labour  segmentation   in  specific  occupations  along  sex  lines  (Preibisch  &  Grez,  2014).  The  significance  of   these  differences  is  particularly  weighted  since  these  occupations  also  have  the  highest   number  of  TFWs  and  the  lowest  wages  (see  chapters  five  and  seven).  

256  

     

  

The  regression  analysis  in  this  dissertation  shows  that  females  in  occupations  

8431-General  farm  workers  and  8432-Nursery  and  greenhouse  workers  tend  to  earn   14%  and  19%  less  than  males,  respectively  (see  Table  12  in  chapter  eight).  The   outcomes  in  occupation  6474-Babysitters,  nannies  and  parents'  helpers  were  not   statistically  significant  in  the  male-female  model,  though  it  was  nevertheless  evident  that   this  occupation  is  heavily  sexed,  with  females  taking  approximately  96%  of  these  jobs.   As  detailed  in  chapter  seven,  there  is  only  slight  variation  in  the  gender  gap  when   accounting  for  immigration  status:  among  Canadian-born  workers  and  NPRs,  4%  were   males  and  96%  were  females  and  among  immigrants,  2%  were  males,  98%  were   females.      Female  domination  in  this  occupation  can  be  traced  back  to  the  ways  in  which  

child-rearing  and  general  caregiving  tasks  have  been  socially  constructed  as  female   tasks:  "In  many  different  cultures,  being  female  is  associated  with  care  for   others...Gender  norms  governing  interpretation  of  appropriate  behaviour  for  women  and   men  are  closely  linked  to  socially  constructed  concepts  of  familial  altruism  and  individual   self-interest.  Women  who  seem  highly  independent  or  ambitious,  like  men  who  seem   highly  dependent  or  family-oriented,  are  often  considered  sexually  unattractive"   (Badgett  &  Folbre,  1999,  p.311).      In  the  case  of  agricultural  labour,  the  literature  shows  that,  while  males  are  

considered  suitable  for  all  types  of  jobs,  females  are  selected  for  only  a  few  jobs,  which   reflects  a  highly  patriarchal  scheme  of  labour  allocation  (Preibisch  &  Grez,  2014).   According  to  a  civil  servant  interviewed  by  Preibisch  (2002)  as  cited  in  Preibisch  and   Grez  (2014),  hiring  women  in  the  agriculture  sector  implies  having  to  make  

257  

     

accommodations  related  to  the  tasks  associated  with  the  job.  Tasks  are  already   associated  with  a  specific  sex:  "Because  women  are  great  if  they're  standing  and   working  with  their  hands,  which  is  what  food  processing  is  all  about,  or  packing,  if  you're   packing  fruit  .  .  .  but  if  you  put  a  female  into  a  tobacco  priming  aid  .  .  .  [employers]  may   find  they  may  not  be  as  durable,  or  the  longevity  of  females  may  not  be  as  great  over   time.  .  .  .  I'm  not  saying  [women]  can't  do  it  [but]  employers  are  leery  about  making   wholesale  changes."  As  this  commentary  indicates,  a  woman's  perceived  capacity  to   develop  certain  tasks,  either  low-  or  high-skilled,  is  often  limited  by  preconceived  ideas   about  women,  their  capacities,  skills,  interests  and  goals  that  tend  to  classify  them  in   lower  positions,  minor  jobs  and  therefore  with  lower  wages.      9.4.  First  Official  Language  Spoken      Not  speaking  either  English  or  French  reduces  the  wages  of  low-skilled  workers.  

In  general,  an  increase  in  proficiency  in  either  of  Canada's  official  languages  is  linked  to   increase  in  earnings  (Chiswick,  1991).  The  regression  analysis  showed  that,   considering  all  98  low-skilled  occupations  included  in  this  research,  not  speaking  either   official  language  represents  almost  14%  less  in  wages  than  speaking  it  (see  Table  12  in   chapter  eight).  This  is  particularly  telling  since  reading  and  writing  skills  are  more   statistically  relevant  vis-a-vis  labour  market  outcomes  than  speaking  skills  (Chiswick,   1991).      When  the  analysis  focuses  on  specific  occupations,  differences  become  more  

acute.  As  Table  14  in  chapter  eight  shows,  whereas  workers  in  occupation  7411-Truck   Drivers,  who  do  not  speak  either  official  language  earn  3%  less  in  wages,  those  in  

258  

     

occupation  6641-Food  counter  attendants,  kitchen  helpers  and  related  occupations  and   6661-Light  duty  cleaners  earn  19%  less;  and  those  in  6421-Retail  salespersons  and   sales  clerks  earn  28%  less.  Often,  those  who  report  speaking  languages  other  than   English  or  French  at  work,  tend  not  to  speak  either  official  language,  although  this  is  not   always  the  case  (Thomas,  2009).  These  immigrants  are  likely  to  report  education  levels   below  high  school,  to  have  landed  at  an  older  age  and  to  speak  a  language  of  Asian   origin  at  work  (Thomas,  2009).  Thus,  language  fluency  can  be  a  means  to  better  labour   market  outcomes  among  low-skilled  workers.  In  general,  NPRs  are  likely  to  work  in   smaller  ethnic  restaurants  where  official  language  requirements  are  less  pressing.   Workers  with  low  official  language  proficiency  tend  to  work  in  jobs  in  the  service  or   manufacturing  industries  (Boyd,  2009).      The  ability  to  speak  either  official  language  is  an  asset  that  some  employers  

actively  seek  while  others  deliberately  avoid.  On  the  one  hand,  proficiency  in  English,   for  example,  has  been  reported  as  a  desirable  skill  that  some  farmers  value.  On  the   other  hand,  some  employers  prefer  workers  who  do  not  question  authority  or  voice  their   rights.  From  this  perspective,  those  who  do  not  (or  cannot)  challenge  anything  are   considered  "good"  workers  and  Mexican  workers  are  preferred  for  their  inability  to  speak   English,  which  limits  "backchat"  (Preibisch  &  Binford,  2007).  A  lack  of  language   proficiency  is  also  used  as  a  means  to  control  relations  among  workers.  Female   Mexican  agricultural  workers  (Spanish  speakers)  are  often  mixed  with  male  Caribbean   workers  (English  speakers)  to  prevent  personal  exchanges  (Preibisch  &  Santamaria,   2006,  as  cited  in  Preibisch  &  Binford,  2007).  \      As  these  examples  indicate,  the  ability  to  speak  the  language  of  the  region  of  

259  

     

one's  workplace  makes  a  difference.  The  basic  human  need  to  communicate  and  to   engage  in  social  exchange  is  greatly  restricted  in  the  case  of  Mexican  workers  working   on  Canadian  farms.  In  contrast,  the  ability  among  Caribbean  workers  to  speak  English   provides  freedom  to  move  and  to  engage  socially  with  their  entourage  (Preibisch  &   Binford,  2007).  Except  for  Ontario,  which  offers  English  and  French  classes  to  low- skilled  refugee  claimants  and  live-in  caregivers  (Ontario  Ministry  of  Citizenship  and   Immigration,  2016),  low-skilled  NPRs  have  no  access  to  language  training.  While  the   Canadian  government  offers  English  and  French  classes  to  permanent  residents  it  does   not  provide  instruction  for  temporary  residents.  It  is  not  considered  economically  viable   to  provide  language  classes  to  people  who  are  not  going  to  stay  in  Canada  (which  is  the   case  of  almost  all  low-skilled  workers).      In  this  way,  a  lack  of  citizenship  presents  a  concrete  barrier  to  integration.  When  

NPRs  lack  language  skills,  it  not  only  impedes  their  integration  via  citizenship;  it  also   makes  them  more  easily  exploitable  and  less  aware  of  their  rights.  It  undermines  their   humanity  and,  by  extension,  ours.  We,  as  Canadians,  miss  the  opportunity  to  learn  from   their  experiences  and  to  explore  other  approaches  to  labour  relations.  Ideally,  labour   exchanges  should  not  be  reduced  to  a  mere  transaction  of  goods,  but  should  consider   the  whole  of  humanity  attached  to  each  worker  (i.e.  their  families  as  well  as  their  social,   psychological  and  political  needs).  Conversely,  when  NPRs  cannot  speak  an  official   Canadian  language,  they  also  miss  the  opportunity  to  learn  about  us.  In  view  of  these   considerations,  all  temporary  foreign  workers,  especially  low-skilled  TFWs  who  provide   Canadians  with  affordable  food,  services  or  products,  should  be  allowed  to  receive   government  subsidized  English  or  French  classes.  

260  

     

9.5.  Level  of  Education        Generally,  post-secondary  education  does  not  favour  the  wages  of  low-skilled  

NPRs  and  it  does  those  of  low-skilled  CB  and  IMM.  While  language  ability  clearly   makes  a  difference  in  labour  market  outcomes,  a  worker's  level  of  education  has  mixed   effects  that  differ  from  occupation  to  occupation  in  the  cross  tabulation  analysis.  The   regression  analysis  from  chapter  eight  (Table  12)  for  all  low-skilled  workers  (CB,  IMM   and  NPRs)  with  a  trade  certificate  or  a  college  degree  represents  a  5.7%  increase  in   wages.  By  the  same  token,  having  a  university  degree  represents  a  6.4%  increase.      When  focusing  on  specific  occupations,  however,  outcomes  vary.  Table  13  in  

chapter  eight  shows  that,  among  Babysitters,  nannies  and  parents'  helpers  (NOC  6474),   a  university  degree  represents  10  %  higher  wages  than  a  high  school  degree.  Among   Visiting  Homemakers  (NOC  6471)  it  represents  19%  more.  Table  14  (also  in  chapter   eight)  shows  that  among  truck  drivers,  a  college  degree  represents  4%  more  in  wages   than  a  high  school  degree;  among  food  counter  attendants,  kitchen  helpers  and  related   occupations  (NOC  6641)  8%  more;  and  among  retail  salespersons  and  sales  clerks   (NOC  6421)  it  represents  11%  more.  A  trades  certificate  or  a  college  degree  among   nursery  and  greenhouse  workers  (NOC  8432)  translates  into  14%  more  income  than  a   high  school  degree;  and  among  light  duty  cleaners  (NOC  6661)  and  retail  salespersons   and  sales  clerks  (NOC  6421)  it  represents  7%  more.      In  some  occupations,  the  level  of  education  does  not  always  make  a  positive  

difference.  Figure  15  from  chapter  seven  shows  that  NPRs  with  a  university  degree  in   occupation  6453-  Food  and  Beverage  Servers  have  significantly  lower  wages  than  their   CB  and  IMM  counterparts.  In  contrast,  those  with  a  high  school  or  college  degree  have  

261  

     

a  significantly  lower  negative  difference.  Restaurant  workers  with  post-secondary   education  tend  to  have  better  labour  conditions,  better  wages  and  more  labour  mobility   than  workers  without  it  (Denstedt,  2008).      It  is  worth  noting  that  this  research  only  includes  cases  of  full-time  employment,  

which  the  census  denotes  as  working  30  hours  or  more  per  week,  whether  in  one  or   more  jobs.  As  a  result,  while  the  models  in  chapter  eight  indicate  that  postsecondary   degrees  have  some  effects  on  wages,  it  is  likely  that  some  of  these  workers  work  in   more  than  one  job,  perhaps  one  that  requires  education  (a  high-skilled  one)  and  another   that  does  not  (a  low-skilled  one).  Another  factor  to  keep  in  mind  is  the  broad  range  of   job  titles  and,  by  extension  educational  requirements  that  each  occupational  group  has.   Further  research  could  address  these  nuances.      Among  NPRs,  the  effects  of  having  a  trade  certificate,  college  degree  or  

university  degree  tend  to  be  neutral.  This  is  not  surprising  considering  that  low-skilled   TFWs  usually  come  to  Canada  to  work  in  occupations  that  do  not  require   postsecondary  education.  The  cross  tabulation  analysis  shows  different  patterns  of   increase/decrease  in  wages  as  the  level  of  education  increases  or  decreases.  While  not   the  primary  goal  of  this  research,  it  is  nevertheless  worth  mentioning  the  skill   underutilization  of  immigrants  in  Canada.      Immigrants  with  post-secondary  education  working  in  low-skilled  jobs  signal  a  

significant  problem  in  labour  market  integration:  all  things  equal,  post-secondary   education  should  lead  to  high  skilled  employment.  According  to  the  2006  census,  of  the   total  (some  707  000)  Immigrants  (naturalized  Canadians  plus  permanent  residents)  

262  

     

working  in  the  98  low-skilled  occupational  groups  included  in  this  research,108  51%   reported  having  high  school  degree  or  less,  while  the  remaining  49%  reported  having   post-secondary  education.  Of  that  49%,  26%  reported  having  a  trade  certificate  or   college  degree  and  23%  a  university  degree.  This  misuse  of  skills  comes  at  a  cost  for   Canada.  In  1996,  for  example,  Canadian  losses  amounted  to  2.4  billion  dollars  in  skill   underutilization  and  12.6  billion  dollars  in  pay  inequity  (Reitz,  2001).  This  significant   underutilization  of  immigrants'  skills  has  been  presented  from  different  angles:  as  a   critique  of  the  human  capital  selection  model109  (Ferrer  et  al.,  2004;  Sweetman,  2005;   2006;  Sweetman  &  S.  McBride,  2004  as  cited  in  Hawthorne,  2007),  and  differences  in   labour  market  outcomes  compared  to  the  Canadian-born  population  (Picot  &  Hou,  2003;   Picot  2004;  Reitz  2005;  Thompson  &  Worswick,  2004  as  cited  in  Hawthorne,  2007).  A   lack  of  work  experience  gained  in  Canada  is  one  of  the  main  barriers  facing  foreigners   who  are  trying  to  integrate  into  the  Canadian  labour  market  (Reitz,  2005),  one  that  can,   negatively  affect  earnings  (Chiswick  &  Miller,  2002).  In  the  attempt  to  overcome  this   obstacle,  the  Ontario  Human  Rights  Commission  introduced  a  policy  in  2013  to  remove   the  "Canadian  experience  barrier."  This  policy  provides  directions  on  best  practices  to   employers,  representatives  of  employers  and  regulatory  bodies  (OHRC,  2013).  Despite   this  policy  change,  there  are  still  considerable  challenges  facing  foreign  workers  trying   to  find  employment  in  Canada:  a  lack  of  proficiency  in  one  of  Canada's  official   languages,  for  example,  limits  integration  into  the  Canadian  labour  market  (Chiswick  &   MIller,  2002)  and  the  non-recognition  of  foreign  credentials  or  foreign  experience   excludes  "immigrants  from  the  upper  segments  of  the  labour  market"  (Bauder,  2003,

  That  is,  the  98  low-skilled  occupational  groups  that  report  use  of  NPRs.     `Human  capital  selection  model'  refers  to  the  selection  of  immigrants  based  on  the  possession  of   postsecondary  education  as  is  the  case  in  Canada.

p.699).      9.6.  Country  of  Birth  -  Regions  of  the  World      Being  born  in  developed  countries  leads  to  positive  wage  differences  and  being  

born  in  developing  countries  leads  to  negative  wage  differences.  Canadian  citizenship   makes  a  difference  among  Mexican-born  workers.  Statistically  significant  wage   differences  according  to  one's  country  of  birth  indicate  that  some  foreign  workers  earn   more  than  those  born  in  Canada  and  some  earn  less.  Four  trends  were  identified  in   chapter  seven,  some  of  which  were  also  corroborated  through  the  regression  analysis  in   chapter  eight:         9.6.1.  Concentration  by  country  of  birth  around  certain  niche  occupations.  

Workers  from  certain  countries  of  origin  concentrate  around  certain  niche  occupations.   Italians  are  well  represented  and  have  the  highest  outcomes  in  occupation  6663- Janitors,  caretakers  and  building  superintendents,  earning  13%  more  than  their   Canadian-born  colleagues.  According  to  the  2011  National  Household  Survey,110  about   260  250  people  reported  being  born  in  Italy  and  1  488  425  reported  having  Italian  ethnic   origin  (this  includes  single  and  multiple  ethnic  origin  responses).  In  the  effort  to   understand  the  relatively  high  wages  earned  by  Italians,  it  is  helpful  to  note  that  a   significant  number  of  Italian  immigrants  came  to  Canada  after  WWI  and  WWII,  that  is,  at   a  time  when  immigration  was  not  attached  to  skills  and  it  was  easier  to  unionize.  If   workers  are  in  industries  that  allow  unionizing,  wages  tend  to  be  higher  and  higher   standards  of  working  conditions  tend  to  prevail.  According  to  the  research  conducted  by

Mandarino  (2009)  on  the  Italian-Canadian  community  in  Toronto,  first-generation  males   generally  tend  to  work  in  construction  and  manufacturing,  while  first-generation  females   tend  to  be  concentrated  in  low-skilled  service  occupations.      Portuguese-speaking  low-skilled  workers  tend  to  congregate  in  occupation  7611-

Construction  trades  helpers  and  labourers.  This  research  shows  that  of  all  immigrants   who  reported  working  in  this  occupation,  27.6%  were  from  either  Brazil  or  Portugal.   According  to  the  2011  National  Household  Survey,  about  429  850  people  reported   Portuguese  ethnic  origin  (this  includes  single  and  multiple  ethnic  origin  responses)  and   140  310  people  reported  Portugal  as  their  place  of  birth  (Statistics  Canada,  2017).   Clifton  (2008)  presents  the  case  of  Portuguese  workers  in  construction.      Another  niche  occupation  is  6474-Babysitters,  nannies  and  parents'  helpers,  

where  the  majority  of  workers  come  from  the  Philippines.  This  pattern  is  well- documented  in  the  literature  (Cohen,  2000;  Faraday,  2012a;  Gardiner,  1997).         9.6.2.  Concentration  around  occupations  with  the  highest  wages.  Low-

skilled  workers  from  Western  and  Southern  Europe  concentrate  around  the  highest  paid   low-skilled  jobs.  The  regression  analysis  in  chapter  eight  showed  that  labour  market   experiences  of  Europeans  are  different  from  the  experiences  of  workers  coming  from   developing  countries.  On  average,  those  born  in  Western,  Central  and  Northern  Europe   are  likely  to  earn  1.3%  higher  wages  than  North  American-born  low-skilled  workers.  In   some  occupations,  this  positive  difference  is  particularly  pronounced.  In  occupation   1431-Accounting  and  related  clerks,  for  example,  low-skilled  workers  from  Britain  earn   16%  more  than  those  born  in  Canada;  and  those  born  in  southern  Europe  (Italy,  Spain,  

265  

     

Portugal)  are  likely  to  earn  8.3%  more  than  North  American-born  workers.  These   examples  illustrate  the  supremacy  granted  certain  nationalities  in  some  occupations  in   the  Canadian  labour  market.      In  some  occupations,  even  after  Canadian  citizenship  is  granted,  wage  

differences  persist,  with  positive  outcomes  for  workers  coming  from  developed  nations   (ex.  UK)  and  negative  outcomes  for  those  coming  from  developing  nations  (ex.  China).   These  findings  help  corroborate  existing  research.  For  example,  it  has  been   documented  that  among  immigrants  with  citizenship  in  Canada,  those  born  in  OECD111   countries  receive  a  premium  attached  to  their  human  capital,  while  those  from  Asia   "experience  a  devaluation  in  their  credentials"  (Devoretz  &  Pivnenko,  2004,  p.25).  As  a   result,  immigrants  born  in  OECD  countries  paid  even  more  taxes  than  those  born  in   Canada  (Bevelander  &  Devoretz,  2008).         9.6.3.  Concentration  around  occupations  with  the  lowest  wages.    Low-skilled  

workers  from  developing  countries  tend  to  concentrate  around  occupations  with  very   low  wage.  They  are  present  in  large  numbers  and  come  primarily  from  Mexico,  the   Philippines,  China  and  India.  Low-skilled  workers  from  less  developed  countries  have   very  different  outcomes  than  UK-born  low-skilled  workers.  Low-skilled  workers  from   Mexico,  India  and  China  tend  to  work  in  more  physically  demanding  occupations  and  to   earn  lower  wages  than  those  born  in  Canada.  Mexican  workers  mainly  work  in   agricultural  occupations.  While  Filipino  workers  are  distributed  throughout  several   occupations,  Filipino  NPRs  are  highly  represented  in  caregiving  occupations.  Chinese   and  Indian  low-skilled  workers  are  distributed  in  other  occupations,  including  6641-Food

counter  attendants,  kitchen  helpers  and  related  occupations  and  6421-Retail   salespersons  and  sales  clerks.      Chapter  five  shows  that  China  is  the  third  and  fifth  source  of  immigrants  and  

NPRs,  respectively,  in  the  Canadian  low-skilled  labour  force.  The  regression  analysis  in   this  dissertation  shows  that  being  born  in  China  represents  a  likelihood  of  earning  9.7%   less  than  those  born  in  North  America.  The  literature  shows  that  the  economic  returns  of   Chinese  immigrants  working  in  enclaves  (that  most  likely  have  low  human  capital)  are   lower  than  those  of  their  counterparts  working  in  the  mainstream  economy  (Xiaoling  Li  &   Li,  2016).  Although  outcomes  are  low  and  the  mainstream  economy  offers  better   opportunities,  enclaves  offer  a  cushion  that  reduces  disparities  (compared  to  working  in   mainstream  economies)  (Xiaoling  Li  &  Li,  2016).      Finally,  chapter  five  also  shows  that  India  is  the  top  source  of  low-skilled  

immigrant  workers  and  the  third  source  of  low-skilled  NPR  workers  in  Canada.  Indian- born  low-skilled  workers  (including  both  NPRs  and  IMM)  are  likely  to  earn  15.6%  less   than  North  American-born  low-skilled  workers.  This  outcome  echoes  findings  in  other   studies,  which  find  that  unemployment  rates  among  Indian-born  immigrants  are  higher   than  those  of  the  Canadian-born  workers  (Agrawal  &  Lovell,  2010,  as  cited  in  George  &   Chaze,  2016)  and  that  the  proportion  of  Indian  low  earners  is  higher  than  that  of   Canadian-born  low  earners  because  of  a  "lack  of  effective  and  vast  networks  within  the   Indian  community"  (George  and  Chaze,  2016,  p.93).      Mexican  migration  to  Canada  has  been  steadily  growing.  Census  information  

shows  the  that  number  of  Mexicans  in  Canada  (IMM  and  NPRs)  who  work  in  both  low-   and  high-skilled  jobs,  increased  from  about  22  000  in  1991  to  42  000  in  2001  (a  98%  

267  

     

increase)  (Mueller,  2005).  The  increasing  number  of  Mexicans  coming  through   humanitarian  pathways  may  hinder  their  possibilities  for  integration  in  the  Canadian   labour  market  (Mueller,  2005).  Despite  the  significant  hardships  and  exploitation  that   agricultural  labour  in  Canada  imposes  on  Mexican  workers  without  access  to   citizenship,  it  nevertheless  provides  them  with  good  source  of  income.  Though  low  by   Canadian  standards,  the  eight-month  wage  of  a  SAWP  worker  is  equivalent  to  five   years  of  work  in  Mexico  (Lustig,  2001,  as  cited  in  Silverman  &  Hari,  2016).  This  serves   as  an  introduction  to  the  next  trend  addressed  in  this  analysis,  which  examines  how   access  to  citizenship  improves  labour  market  outcomes  of  Mexicans.         9.6.4.  Wages  by  country  of  birth  when  citizenship  is  accounted  for.  When  

citizenship  is  accounted  for,  wages  among  foreign-born  citizens  ('immigrants'  in  this   dissertation)  improve  in  agricultural  occupations  and  in  truck  driving.  When  accounting   for  immigration  status  (where  NPR  numbers  allow  statistically  significant  comparisons),   low-skilled  NPRs  earn  significantly  lower  wages  than  Canadian-born  and  immigrant   workers.  Mexican  NPRs  in  occupation  8431-General  Farm  Workers,  for  example,  earn   20%  less  than  CB  and  14%  less  than  IMM.  However,  when  citizenship  is  granted,   differences  decrease.  Mexican  immigrants  and  permanent  residents  working  in  the   same  occupation,  8431-General  Farm  Workers,  earn  only  7%  less  than  Canadian-born   workers.      Differences  in  wages  based  on  country  of  origin  have  been  registered  in  legal  

actions  initiated  by  unions.  In  British  Columbia,  for  example,  the  Construction  and   Specialized  Workers  Union  (CSWU)  complained  to  the  provincial  labour  relations  board  

268  

     

about  unfair  labour  practices.  According  to  CSWU,  a  Canadian  joint  venture  was  paying   significantly  lower  wages  to  workers  from  Latin  America  than  what  they  were  promised   and  what  European  workers  were  being  paid  (about  30%  more)  (Fudge  &  MacPhail,   2009).  The  venture  was  mandated  to  pay  compensation  to  the  workers,  however  the   decision  was  appealed  by  the  employer  and  the  minister  of  immigration  at  the  time,  J.   Kenney,  expressed  concerned  with  the  tribunal's  decision  and  also  expressed  "intention   to  decertify  the  union  that  filled  the  complaint"  (Fudge  and  MacPhail,  2009,  p.40).  The   Supreme  Court  re-sent  the  case  to  the  board  for  an  unbiased  decision  (Fudge  &   MacPhail,  2009).  In  2012,  the  tribunal  had  valued  the  damages  done  to  the  workers  as   "$2.4  million  (the  largest  human  rights  award  in  Canadian  history)  that  had  increased  to   $2.5  million  with  interest  by  late  2012"  (Mandryk,  2012,  p.22).  In  December  2012,  the   workers  agreed  to  a  negotiated  settlement  for  an  undisclosed  sum  (Mandryk,  2014).   This  case  is  an  example  of  how  hard  and  lengthy  it  can  be  to  make  legal  claims  in   favour  of  temporary  foreign  workers  when  their  rights  are  violated  (Fudge  and  McPhail,   2009).      Labour  market  differentials  by  country  of  birth  show  that  immigrants  from  the  

Philippines  tend  to  earn  similar  wages  to  those  born  in  Canada  (Gilmore,  2008).  This   study  also  finds  that,  in  some  occupations,  immigrants  from  the  Philippines  tend  to  have   similar  and  sometimes  higher  wages  than  their  Canadian-born  counterparts.   Nonetheless,  in  a  few  occupations,  immigrants  from  the  Philippines  earn  less  than  those   born  in  Canada.  In  occupation  6421-Retail  salespersons  and  sales  clerks,  for  example,   immigrants  from  the  Philippines  earn  7%  less  than  Canadian-born  workers.      In  some  cases,  immigrants  from  certain  countries  tend  to  have  negative  

269  

     

differentials  compared  to  Canadian-born  workers,  although  those  differentials  tend  to   decrease  as  their  time  in  Canada  increases.  The  wage  difference  between  immigrants   from  Africa  and  Canadian-born  workers,  however,  persists  over  time  (Gilmore,  2008).  As   these  examples  indicates,  a  worker's  country  of  origin  makes  a  difference  when   examining  wages,  an  observation  that  resonates  with  outcomes  commonly  found  in  the   literature.  However,  when  the  focus  is  limited  to  low-skilled  workers,  other   characteristics,  such  as  immigration  status,  have  a  greater  weight  than  country  of  origin   does.  Immigration  status  significantly  changes  the  wage  differentials  of  low-skilled   workers  by  country  of  origin.  For  example,  British-born  NPR  truck  drivers  earn   significantly  less  than  Canadian-born  truck  drivers;  in  contrast  British-born  immigrant   truck  drivers  earn  significantly  more  than  Canadian-born  truck  drivers.  This  pattern  was   evident  among  workers  that  showed  statistically  significant  outcomes  when   comparisons  between  CB  and  the  other  two  categories  (IMM  and  NPRs)  took  place  (ex.   Mexicans  in  occupation  8431-General  farm  workers).            9.7.  Final  Considerations   Of  all  the  costs  that  a  business  owner  faces,  wages  are  among  the  most  elastic.  

In  addition,  some  employers  have  the  possibility  of  accessing  foreign  workers  who  are   willing  to  perform  jobs  that  locals  would  not  do  for  a  low  wage.  Low  wages  among  low- skilled  temporary  foreign  workers  are  the  outcome  of  many  converging  forces.  Two  of   those  forces  are:  1)  employers  willing  to  draw  on  a  labour  force  of  unemployed  or   underemployed  people  willing  to  work  for  lower  wages  than  locals112  are;  and  2)  a   foreign  labour  force  eager  to  work  for  wages  that  are  significantly  higher  than  what  they

  From  the  region  within  the  province/territory  where  the  jobs  are

could  earn  in  their  homeland.  While  local  (regional)  and  national  market  forces  usually   define  the  wage  equilibrium  through  the  supply  and  demand  of  labour,  in  the  case  of   temporary  foreign  labour,  a  mix  of  local,  national  and  foreign  forces  work  together  to   define  local  wages.      While  Canada's  capacity  to  influence  foreign  forces  is  limited,  it  nevertheless  

does  have  a  measure  of  control  over  domestic  forces.  For  example,  the  Canadian   government  can  install  monitoring  mechanisms  that  enforce  better  wages113.  Yet,  as   explained  at  the  beginning  of  this  chapter,  although  Canada  currently  has  such   mechanisms  in  place,  they  are  not  very  effective.  One  of  the  main  challenges  in  the   current  globalized  world  is  that  domestic  parameters  are  defined  by  forces  that  seem  to   operate  outside  the  nation-state.  This  situation  begs  the  question:  if  domestic  workers   are  not  willing  to  perform  certain  jobs  at  a  minimum  wage,  some  of  which  are  highly   physically  demanding,  is  it  ethical  for  workers  from  other  countries  to  do  so?  Is  it  ethical   to  allow  foreign  workers  to  perform  jobs  that  are  underpaid  by  local  standards  just   because  they  are  above  the  wages  that  these  workers  would  earn  in  their  countries  of   origin?  To  what  extent  can  the  government  intervene  by  advocating  for  wages  defined   by  local  conditions?  Is  a  minimum  wage  sufficient  to  avoid  underpayment?      Looking  at  the  wages  paid  to  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  agricultural  workers,  

their  wages  are  significantly  lower  than  the  wages  of  Canadian-born  and  immigrant   workers  performing  the  same  jobs.  Compared  to  other  low-skilled  jobs,  agricultural  jobs   are  among  the  most  physically  demanding  and,  as  this  research  shows,  they  are  among

  Some  caregivers  and  agricultural  workers  report  working  longer  hours  that  go  unpaid,  which  makes   real  wages  very  low  (Bakan  &  Stasiulis,  1997;  Fudge  &  MacPhail,  2009),  in  some  cases  even  lower  than   minimum  wage  (Faraday,  2014).       

271  

     

the  lowest  paid.  The  low  wages  in  the  agricultural  sector  are  the  outcome  of  a   transnational  labour  situation  that  has  gradually  been  accepted  to  the  point  that  it  is  no   longer  seen  as  cause  for  concern.  For  the  most  part,  it  has  been  accepted  that  the  local   labour  market  is  regulated  by  a  labour  price  dictated  by  forces  outside  our  borders.      But,  then  the  question  persists:  why  do  people  with  citizenship  (Canadian-born  

and  immigrant)  earn  higher  wages?  Perhaps,  this  discrepancy  is  not  the  result  of   equilibrium  of  supply  and  demand,  but  rather  reflects  a  situation  in  which,  by  accepting   lower  wages,  temporary  foreign  workers  compensate  the  higher  wages  paid  to  locals  in   the  same  occupations.  To  test  this,  future  research  account  for  different  types  of   occupations  because,  although  most  low-skilled  non-citizens  earn  less  than  nationals,   variations  are  linked  to  type  of  occupation.      Two  main  high-level  outcomes  stand  out:  first,  citizenship  status  has  a  broad  

impact  or  correlation  on  wages  therefore  non-citizenship  is  costly  to  NPRs.  There  is  a   non-citizenship  penalty  (when  it  comes  to  wages)  assigned  to  Non-Permanent   Residents.  Second,  among  NPRs  with  no  pathway  to  citizenship,  there  is  a  hierarchy;   some  variables  relatively  identify  a  kind  of  pecking  order  for  low-skilled  NPRs.  There  is   a  penalty  but  it  is  not  an  equalized  penalty,  an  order  of  NPR  low-skilled  wage  levels  in   the  Canadian  labour  market.  Thus,  sex,  region  or  country  of  birth,  province  of  residence   and  rural  or  urban  place  of  work  matter.            Summary   While  TFWs  are  officially  entitled  to  the  same  wages  as  Canadian-born  and  

immigrant  employees  working  in  the  same  occupation,  research  indicates  that  these  

272  

     

workers  typically  earn  lower  wages.  8431-General  Farm  Worker  NPRs  exhibited  lower   wages  than  CB  (20%  lower  in  Ontario  and  9%  in  Quebec)  and  Babysitters,  nannies  and   parents'  helper  NPRs,  even  after  accounting  for  room  and  board,  also  exhibited  lower   wages  than  CB  (17%  less  in  Ontario,  6%  in  Quebec,  6%  in  Alberta  and  2%  in  BC).   Wage  differences  across  provinces  are  affected  by  the  fact  that  provinces  have  different   economies.  Other  effects  not  accounted  for  in  this  analysis  may  also  affect  wages   including  seniority.  Regional  analyses  within  provinces  show  differences  in  employment   patterns  across  regions  within  provinces  (see  Ontario  Chamber  of  Commerce   Projections,  2016).  However,  Ontario  is  the  largest  user  of  low-skilled  temporary  foreign   workers  in  agriculture  (see  chapter  five).  The  literature  confirms  these  outcomes.      While  NPRs  in  a  significant  number  of  occupations  exhibited  lower  wages  than  

CB  and  IMM,  there  were  some  occupations  with  the  opposite  outcome.  At  least  four   occupations  exhibited  positive  differences  (higher  wages  among  the  NPR  population   vis-à-vis  the  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  populations).  These  positive  differences  may   be  an  indication  of  tightness  between  demand  and  supply  in  the  labour  market,  regional   differences  in  wages,  a  higher  number  of  weeks/hours  worked  during  the  year  2005,   and  wage  dispersion.      Workers'  country  of  origin  does  influence  wage  discrepancies  and  the  type  of  

employment,  however  when  citizenship  is  accounted  for,  wage  differences  decrease.   The  literature  also  demonstrates  that  legal  processes  in  favour  of  foreign  workers  can   be  lengthy  and  require  the  support  of  unions  to  stand  the  many  challenges  ahead.      Wage  dispersion  is  a  significant  factor  behind  wage  differences.  A  quartile  

analysis  for  truck  drivers  reveals  that  those  with  wages  in  the  second  and  third  quartiles  

273  

     

have  average  wages  below  those  of  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  workers  (See   Appendix  9).  Wages  in  the  fourth  quartile  inflate  the  overall  average  for  the  NPR   population  in  this  occupation,  making  the  differences  positive.  A  high  wage  dispersion,   caused  by  the  diversity  of  jobs  in  this  occupational  group,  explains  why  the  average   differences  for  the  whole  sample  are  positive  while  remaining  negative  for  the  central   (second  and  third)  quartiles.  The  next  chapter  will  elaborate  on  the  fact  that  the  state   often  functions  as  a  broker  with  a  preference  for  capital  and  will  outline  the  theoretical   contributions  of  this  dissertation.

Chapter  Ten:  Theoretical  and  Analytical  Contributions      This  chapter  discusses  the  outcomes  of  the  present  research  within  the  context  

of  theories  of  migration,  the  state  and  citizenship.  The  first  part  focuses  primarily  on   migration  theories.  The  second  part  explores  Bob  Jessop's  theoretical  treatment  of  the   role  of  the  state,  which  are  essentially  neo-Marxist.  The  third  part  presents  citizenship   as  a  means  by  which  a  vulnerable  foreign  workforce  is  brought  in  to  the  country  mostly   as  cheap  labour.  Both  the  Rational  Choice  Theory  and  Critical  Social  Theory  illuminate   the  outcomes  of  this  dissertation  in  two  fundamentally  different  ways.  As  explained  in   chapter  two,  Rational  Choice  Theory  and  Critical  Social  Theory  can  inform  from  very   different  analytical  perspectives  the  quantitative  analyses  presented  in  chapters  five,   six,  seven  and  eight.  This  chapter  contests  the  outcomes  of  those  quantitative  chapters   by  incorporating  theories  of  migrations,  the  state  and  citizenship  offered  by  Critical   Social  Theory.      10.1.  Migration  Theories      10.1.1.  Neoclassical  Theory  of  Migration.  As  discussed  in  chapter  two,  

neoclassical  theoretical  approaches  maintain  that  migrants  find  work  outside  of  their   countries  of  origin  because  of  a  combination  of  pull  forces  (better  wages)  in  their   destination  countries  and  push  forces  (low  wages  and  generally  terrible  labour   conditions)  in  their  countries  of  origin  (Binford,  2009).  This  theory  highlights  geographic   differences  in  the  supply  and  demand  of  labour  (Massey  et  al.,  1993).  For  example,   from  a  macro  perspective,  TFWs  from  Mexico  and  the  Caribbean  move  from  a  labour- abundant  location  to  one  that  is  scarce  in  labour.  From  this  perspective,  TFWs'  decision  

275  

     

to  move  to  Canada  for  work  is  a  rational  one,  based  on  the  following  considerations:   labour  shortages  and  better  wages  in  Canada  and  labour  excess  and  hostile  labour   conditions  in  the  workers'  countries  of  origin.  In  this  way,  labour  migration  optimizes  the   redistribution  of  production  factors  by  benefiting  both  sending  and  receiving  countries   (Haas,  2010).     The  dissertation  findings  suggest  that  a  neoclassical  reading  of  migration  assumes   the  existence  of  a  supply-demand  equilibrium  that  regulates  the  price  of  labour.  It   encourages  the  increase  of  temporary  foreign  labour  as  a  response  to  labour  scarcity  in   the  destination  countries  and  labour  abundance  in  the  countries  of  origin,  which  causes   wages  to  sink  (to  the  legal  minimum)  (see  appendix  15).  However,  such  rational  market   models  do  not  entirely  explain  the  economic  reality  of  temporary  foreign  labour,  since   they  cannot  account  for  why  the  wages  of  low-skilled  temporary  labourers  tend  to  be   lower  than  those  of  the  Canadian  and  immigrant  populations  in  a  specific  occupation   (see  chapters  six,  seven  and  eight).        It  is  worth  making  clear  that  other  theoretical  perspectives  describe  that  labour  is  

not  as  mobile  as  capital.  Other  perspectives  argue  that  is  not  labour  scarcity  but  wage   scarcity  (people  that  work  for  those  low  wages)  what  drives  most  low-skilled  labour   migration.  Low-skilled  workers  are  not  as  free  to  move  as  the  theory  implies.   Additionally,  the  rational  model  does  not  address  values  such  as  fairness  or  human   rights.  Nor  does  it  account  for  the  reasons  behind  the  labour  scarcity  and  abundance  in   countries  of  destination  and  of  origin,  respectively.  In  particular,  it  does  not  account  for   the  structures  that  created  high  wages  and  scarcity  of  labour  in  some  regions  and  an   abundance  of  labour  and  horrible  labour  conditions  in  other  regions.  Moreover,  it  does  

276  

     

not  account  for  the  consequences  of  the  increase  in  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  labour   in  Canada,  that  is,  a  deterioration  of  local  wages.  Neo-Marxist  theories  of  migration  help   address  these  deficits  by  illuminating  other  forces  at  play  in  economic  developments.   The  Historical  Structural  Theory  (and  its  dependant  Segmented  Labour  Theory)  shed   some  light  in  the  next  section  on  the  fact  that  even  if  Canada  benefits  from  the  low   wages  of  skilled  temporary  foreign  workers,  this  benefit  comes  under  an  indentured   structure  via  several  characteristics  including  ethnic  origin,  sex  and  low  wages.  As   Zolberg  (1991a,  1991b)  presents,  global  asymmetries  in  the  labour  market  have  origins   in  slavery  and  are  the  outcome  of  the  interplay  of  competing  forces  at  play  via  concepts   like  sovereignty,  citizenship  and  national  identity.         10.1.2.  Historical  Structural  Theory.  The  significant  number  of  Caribbean  and  

Mexican  workers  presented  in  my  findings  in  chapter  five  are  not  only  a  response  to   neoliberal  policies  introduced  in  Canada  that  are  designed  to  benefit  employers,  but  are   also  the  consequence  of  a  colonial  relation  with  the  British  West  Indies  and  Spanish   America  that  can  be  traced  back  to  the  eighteen  and  nineteenth  centuries  (Plascencia,   2016),  what  Anibal  Quijano  calls  the  "Coloniality  of  Power"  (as  cited  in  Plascencia,  2016,   p.231).  That  is,  over  an  extended  history  of  exploitation,  workers  from  these  countries   were  constructed  to  be  especially  suitable  at  performing  the  activities  demanded  by   labour-intensive  occupations.  For  example,  Mexicans  were  constructed  to  be  docile  and   to  have  the  requisite  stamina  to  perform  physically  demanding  labour  without  protesting   (Plascencia,  2016;  Preibisch  &  Binford,  2007).  My  findings  show  that  Mexican  workers   are  indeed  confined  to  physically  demanding  occupations  (e.g.  agriculture)  while  some  

277  

     

from  European  origin  work  in  less  physically  demanding  occupations.  As  this  example   indicates,  classifications  based  on  race  are  essential  for  such  constructed  modes  of   production  to  work.  Accordingly,  the  historical  structural  approach  also  includes  a  theory   that  helps  account  for  the  segmentation  of  workers'  experience,  which,  as  this  research   confirms,  often  takes  place  along  the  lines  of  race  and  gender.      More  specifically,  the  dissertation  shows  that  place  of  birth  (as  a  proxy  of  ethnic  

origin)  is  associated  to  the  type  of  occupation  and  level  of  wage,  particularly  in   occupations  that  are  physically  demanding  (like  occupations  in  agriculture).  This  is   consistent  with  the  stereotypes  associated  with  certain  occupations  described  in  the   literature  (e.g.  babysitters  and  nannies  are  female  workers  from  the  Philippines).  Race   and  ethnic  origin  have  been  central  to  the  use  of  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  labour   (Hennebry,  2012;  Preibisch  &  Binford,  2007;  Sharma,  2001).  These  two  elements,  along   with  a  lack  of  official  language  skills,  have  been  the  means  for  indentured  labour  in   Canadian  agriculture  via  temporary  foreign  low-skilled  labour  programs  (Preibisch,   2010).        This  dissertation  provides  quantitative  evidence  to  support  on  the  Historical  

Structural  Theories,  the  Segmented  Labour  Market  Theory.  It  demonstrates  that  three   main  groups  of  low-skilled  workers  (in  agriculture,  caregiving  and  in  other  low-skilled   occupations)  each  exhibit  different  types  of  segmentation.  For  all  low-skilled  workers,   segmentation  of  different  wage  brackets  is  enabled  by  a  lack  of  citizenship.  In  addition   to  wage-related  segmentation,  agricultural  workers  also  experience  race-related   segmentation,  with  Caribbean  workers  being  constructed  as  valuable  for  certain   agricultural  activities  and  Mexicans  for  others.  Live-in  caregivers  are  segmented  

278  

     

according  to  gender  and  country  of  origin.  The  significant  concentration  of  female   workers  from  the  Philippines  in  caregiving  occupations  demonstrates  this  as  well  as  the   segmentation  associated  with  non-citizenship,  even  though,  unlike  other  groups,  LICs   have  a  possible  pathway  to  citizenship  (which  is  now  more  restricted).      10.2.  The  Role  of  the  State      As  outlined  in  chapter  two,  Bob  Jessop  is  one  of  the  renowned  state  theorists  

whose  neo-Marxist  approach  to  Critical  Social  Theory  explores  the  role  of  stakeholder   interests  in  shaping  state  policymaking,  as  the  state  essentially  acts  (passes  policies,   laws,  regulations)  in  response  to  their  competing  interests  and  power.    This   conceptualization  of  the  state  is  particularly  germane  to  this  dissertation,  especially  in   relation  to  power.      If  we  understand  power  to  be  economically  and  socially  embedded,  it  is  critical  to  

consider  the  ways  in  which  different  stakeholders  and  interests  shape  the  structures   and  processes,  which,  in  turn,  affect  wages  of  low-skilled  labourers  in  Canada.  My   findings  show  that  a  lack  of  citizenship  negatively  affects  the  wages  of  NPRs.  This   research  has  also  shown  that,  to  a  lesser  degree,  other  characteristics  seem  to  affect   workers'  wages  in  different  ways.  In  addition  to  the  common  negative  labour  market   outcomes  associated  with  a  lack  of  citizenship,  there  are  differentiated  negative   outcomes  linked  to  various  characteristics,  including  the  type  of  occupation,  sex,   province  of  residence,  ethnic  origin  and  country  of  origin.  Similarly,  when  the  workers   are  separated  according  to  the  three  identified  groups  (live-in  caregivers,  agricultural   workers  and  other  low-skilled  workers  in  selected  occupations)  a  lack  of  citizenship  

279  

     

negatively  affects  their  labour  market  outcomes.  Nevertheless,  each  group's  set  of   policies  has  been  segmented  according  to  different  policy  pathways.  Those  specific   labour  market  experiences  are  the  outcome  of  a  combination  of  forces  and,  in  some   cases,  is  channeled  through  the  state  via  policies  (Satzewich,  2008).  The  state  has   become  the  vehicle  for  a  kind  of  economic  class  domination  via  policy  (Satzewich,   2008).      Currently,  economics,  especially  liberal  economics,  dominates  the  paradigm  in  

which  policies  are  developed.  The  social  role  of  the  state  has  shifted  from  provider  to   "entrepreneur"  with  the  "market"  considered  to  be  the  main  solution  to  many  policy   issues  (Painter  &  Pierre,  2005).      The  organization  of  labour  is  directly  linked  to  the  social  relations  of  production  in  

economic  class  domination.  This  is  what  drives  the  tensions  between  the  two  main   actors  (capital  and  labour).  This  dissertation  provides  evidence  to  show  that  temporary   foreign  labour  in  Canada  makes  a  striking  example  of  how  labour  is  reorganized  to   predominantly  favour  the  economy  (Satzewich,  2008).  This  is  especially  evident  in   policies  that  allowed  employers  to  have  easy  and  'on-time'  access  to  temporary  labour   (Gross,  2014;  Hennebry,  2012)  at  lower  wages  than  Canadian-born  and  immigrant.   Drawing  on  an  example  from  the  agricultural  sector,  Satzewich  (2008)  reports  that   policymakers  responded  to  different  opposing  forces  and  the  outcome  solved  some   social  issues,  for  example,  hyper-exploited  undocumented  Mexican  labour  in  southern   Ontario.  Those  same  policies,  however,  also  created  conditions  for  perennial  access  to   cheap  foreign  agricultural  labour,  which  continues  to  be  exploitative  (Basok,  2002;   Preibisch,  2007),  if  to  a  lesser  degree  than  what  was  reported  in  the  late  1960s  in  

280  

     

Satzewich's  research  (2008).  Even  if  this  is  the  case  for  the  most  part,  it  is  worth   mentioning  that  the  state  also  responds  to  stakeholders'  pressures  (including  advocacy   groups),  albeit  in  a  way  that  favours  capital.      The  introduction  of  regulations  curbing  temporary  low-skilled  foreign  labour  

reflects  policymaking  that  predominantly  responds  to  political  pressures  and  neoliberal   agendas  rather  than  to  evidence.  The  state  in  this  case  acts  as  a  not  entirely  neutral   broker  of  political  pressures,  a  broker  with  a  penchant  towards  capital.  The  evidence  of   this  dissertation  does  suggest  that  by  opening  doors  to  temporary  foreign  labour,  the   government,  to  a  certain  extent,  manipulates  the  conditions  of  the  domestic  labour   market.  Wages  are  not  measured  according  to  local  economic  standards,  but  rather  to   international  standards,  and  are  low  for  locals  but  relatively  high  for  foreigners.  In  this   system,  employers  have  the  best  of  both  worlds:  local  production  with  foreign  (lower)   wages.  In  other  words,  the  displacement  of  local  low-skilled  labour  takes  place  via   wages114  rather  than  geography.  Nevertheless,  Canadian  employers  (e.g.  farmers)  are   in  a  way  also  powerless  vis-à-vis  international  wages.  They  may  be  competing  against   products  harvested  at  even  lower  costs  of  labour.  A  study  among  low  skilled  workers  in   the  USA  found  that  "undocumented  migrants  earn  about  20  percent  less,  on  average,   than  legal  immigrants,  while  temporary  legal  workers  earn  around  13  percent  less"   (Massey  and  Gentsch,  2014,  p.491).        The  outcomes  of  this  research  work  also  suggest  that  temporary  foreign  labour  

programs  are  part  of  the  same  neoliberal  agenda  that  erodes  the  social  responsibility  of   government  and  places  the  apparatus  of  the  state  at  the  service  of  the  market,  a  market

  Unfortunately,  the  present  analysis,  which  is  made  at  the  occupation  level,  is  not  granular  enough  to   uncover  wage  differences  associated  with  actual  jobs.  This  information  is  currently  unavailable.         

281  

     

free  from  state  interventions.  It  has  been  claimed  that  the  government  of  Prime  Minister   Stephen  Harper  enhanced  conditions  that  significantly  increased  the  use  of  the   temporary  foreign  worker  program  (Gross,  2014),  resulting  in  an  expansion  of   exploitation  (Strauss  &  McGrath,  2016;  UFCW,  2015).  My  findings  capture  the   beginning  of  this  era.  Prime  Minister  Harper's  neoliberal  ideology  was  evident   throughout  his  time  as  Prime  Minister,  which  was  especially  evident  in  his  interest  in   Latin-America  and  his  alignment  with  like-minded  economies  in  the  region  (Macdonald,   2016).  This  is  of  relevance  to  an  analysis  of  temporary  foreign  low-skilled  labour  (low- skilled  non-citizens)  in  Canada,  given  the  significant  dominance  of  low-skilled  Mexican   labour  in  agriculture.   Based  on  the  evidence,  the  low  wage  of  non-citizen  low-skilled  workers  and  their   inability  to  acquire  citizenship  are  consistent  with  the  state's  non-neutral  brokerage  role.   While  the  ideologies  of  bureaucrats  have  been  shown  to  influence  policy  (Satzewich,   2008),  the  government's  role  as  a  biased  broker  of  competing  interests  has  also  been   documented,  especially  when  pressures  from  different  advocacy  groups  are  mounting   (Faraday  2016;  Satzewich,  2008).  However,  the  ways  in  which  the  state  is  not  class- neutral  become  evident  when  policies  that  respond  to  pressures  from  advocacy  groups   nevertheless  end  up  aligning  with  the  advancement  of  capital.  This  is  evident  in  the   2014  changes  in  TFW  policy,  introduced  in  chapter  three,  which  addressed  some  of  the   concerns  expressed  by  academics  and  advocacy  groups  but  opened  other  avenues  for   even  greater  exploitation  (Faraday,  2016).  The  incidence  of  lobbying  initiatives  has  also   been  evaluated.  Rheault  (2013)  explores  the  incidence  of  lobbying  efforts  on   immigration  policy  in  Canada.  Rheault's  study  shows  that  there  is  a  direct  relation  

282  

     

between  the  number  of  lobbying  meetings  between  corporations  and  the  federal   government  with  policies  created  to  increase  the  number  of  temporary  foreign  workers.   Nevertheless,  he  does  not  make  the  distinction  between  low  and  high  skilled  workers   which  is  key  in  policy  design  (of  TFW  programs).        Although  most  of  the  exponential  growth  of  the  TFW  programs  took  place  during  

the  government  of  Prime  Minister  Harper,  TFW  programs  were  mainly  a  Liberal  creation   (Satzewich,  2008).  Prior  to  the  introduction  of  the  Low-Skilled  Pilot  Program  in  2002,   during  the  Liberal  government  of  Jean  Chretien  the  Temporary  Foreign  Worker  Program   was  only  for  live-in  caregivers  and  agricultural  workers  through  the  SAWP115  (see   chapter  three).  Chretien  opened  the  doors  for  temporary  migration  in  a  broad  range  of   low-skilled  occupations  (Curry,  2014).  He  widened  the  door  to  low-skilled  labour  to   satisfy  employers'  needs:      Then  Canadian  Prime  Minister  Jean  Chretien,  in  Mexico  in  March  2003,  said:  

`This  program  where  your  farmers  can  come  and  work  in  Canada  has  worked  extremely   well  and  now  we  are  exploring  (ways)  to  extend  that  to  other  sectors.  The  bilateral   seasonal  agricultural  workers  program  has  been  a  model  for  balancing  the  flow  of   temporary  foreign  workers  with  the  needs  of  Canadian  employers.'  (Mueller,  2005  p.45)      As  this  example  indicates,  both  Conservative  and  Liberal  government  leaders  

have  been  involved  in  promoting  the  advance  of  capital  over  the  interests  of  low-skilled   workers.  However,  as  presented  in  the  literature  review,  the  state  is  neither  a  subject   nor  a  thing  but  an  "ensemble  of  institutions  and  organizations  that  exercises  power  to   the  extent  that  it  does  so  successfully  through  an  institutionally  mediated  condensation   of  the  changing  balance  of  forces  oriented  to  exercise  state  capacities"  (Jessop,  2014,  
                                                                                                 
115

  These  two  programs  were  also  introduced  by  Liberal  governments.    

283  

     

40:07).  State  "powers"  are  "activated  by  changing  sets  of  politicians  and  officials  located   in  specific  sites  acting  in  specific  conjunctures  with  specific  horizons  of  action"  (Jessop,   2014,  44:39).  In  this  way,  the  state  is  also  a  mediator  of  forces.  Therefore,  in  the  case  of   low-skilled  temporary  foreign  labour,  the  state,  via  policymakers,  navigates  different   competing  interests,  a  process  that  is  heavily  marked  by  the  ideologies  and  agendas  of   elected  officials  and,  to  some  degree,  of  bureaucrats.  This  is  central  to  this  dissertation,   because  the  state  as  a  biased  broker  crafts  polices  that  ease  the  access  to  low-wage   labour.  This  happens  even  when  the  state  responds  to  complaints  of  exploitation  linked   to  those  same  low  wages  presented  in  this  dissertation.    As  the  outcome  of  various   social  relations,  Bob  Jessop  has  noted  that  state  policies  themselves  vary  and  are   marked  by  what  he  describes  as  selectively  shifting  biases:      in  analyzing  the  strategic  selectivities  (s.i.c.)  of  the  state  as  a  social  relation,  its   bias  as  a  strategic  site  of  political  action  must  be  connected  to  specific  strategies   pursued  by  specific  forces  (or  specific  sets  of  such  forces)  with  specific  identities   in  order  to  advance  specific  interests  over  specific  spatial  and  temporal  horizons   relative  to  specific  other  forces,  each  advancing  their  own  interests  through  their   own  strategies  over  their  own  spatial  and  temporal  horizons.  Particular  forms  of   state  privilege  the  access  of  some  forces  over  others,  some  strategies  over   others,  some  interests  over  others,  some  spatial  and  temporal  horizons  of  action   over  others,  and  some  coalition  possibilities  over  others.  This  suggests  in  turn   that  a  change  in  the  self-identity  of  political  forces,  the  pursuit  of  different   interests,  the  development  of  different  strategies,  the  adoption  of  different  spatial   and/or  temporal  horizons  of  action,  or  the  building  of  different  blocs,  strategic   alliances,  or  temporary  coalitions  could  well  lead  to  different  outcomes,  making  it   easier  or  harder  to  achieve  specific  objectives  in  and  through  a  given  type  of   state,  a  given  state  form,  or  a  given  form  of  regime.  It  also  suggests  that   reorganizing  the  state  ­  its  modes  of  representation,  its  internal  articulation,  its   modes  of  intervention,  its  social  bases,  the  currently  dominant  state  project  or   mode  of  political  legitimation,  or,  where  relevant,  the  state's  broader  hegemonic   project  for  the  wider  society  ­  will  change  its  strategic  selectivities.  (Jessop,   1999,  p.54-55)  
  

This  variation  in  policies  in  the  case  of  low-skilled  TFW  policy  is  evident  in  the  way  in   284  
     

which  the  government  of  P.  M.  Harper  shifted  policies  from  openness  between  2006   and  2013  to  restricted  openness  in  2014  (recall  that  that  year  the  government   introduced  several  measures  to  reduce  the  flow  mainly  of  low-skilled  temporary  foreign   workers,  as  discussed  earlier  in  chapter  three).  In  2014,  the  government  did  introduce   regulations  to  curb  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  labour,  for  example,  by  capping  the   proportion  of  low-wage  temporary  foreign  labour.  The  shift  happened  in  response  to   variations  in  the  forces  at  play,  in  the  form  of  pressures  from  the  media  (Beatty,  2014;   Valiani,  2013;  Healy  and  Trew,  2015),  advocacy  groups,  academics,  the  workers   themselves  (HUMA,  2016),  as  well  as  growing  expressions  of  concern  from  the   Conservative  Party's  own  traditional  base  of  support  critical  of  the  erosion  of   employment  opportunities  due  to  the  growth  of  the  temporary  foreign  worker  program   (Wingrove  and  Curry,  2014).  However,  by  so  doing,  it  introduced  regulations  that   actually  increased  precariousness  among  low-skilled  workers,  by,  for  example,  capping   the  number  of  LICs  who  can  apply  for  permanent  residence,  and  that  negatively   affected  some  industry  sectors,  for  example,  the  hotel  industry  (Faraday,  2016).   Nevertheless,  as  Jessop  proposes,  not  just  employers'  efforts  in-form  policy  but  many   forces  at  play  including  advocacy  groups,  employers,  unions,  the  media,  etc.      10.3.  Citizenship      This  section  will  engage  in  a  critical  analysis  of  citizenship,  from  a  theoretical  

perspective,  and  its  effect  on  low-skilled  TFWs  in  Canada.  The  data  shows  consistently   that  citizenship  as  the  main  element  differentiating  outcomes  for  TFWs  and  CB  and  IMM   and  critically  examines  the  current  citizenship  structure  in  Canada,  which  allows  some  

285  

     

low-skilled  foreign  nationals  to  work  under  conditions  that  Canadians,  by  and  large,  do   not  accept.  This  is  particularly  daunting  since  the  most  exploited  among  these  workers   (agricultural  workers  and  live-in  caregivers,  who  in  this  dissertation  are  among  the   workers  with  the  largest  negative  wage  differences)  provide  the  very  products  and   services  that  allow  Canadians  not  only  to  prosper  economically,  but  to  actually  live  and   be  productive.  They  harvest  the  food  we  eat  and  look  after  our  children,  our  sick  and  our   elderly;  they  allow  us  to  actually  live  by  releasing  us  from  the  activities  that  are  essential   for  our  survival.116      In  Canada,  citizenship  defines  the  relationship  between  an  individual  and  the  

Canadian  state  either  by  birth  or  by  naturalization  (these  being  the  two  main  ways  of   acquiring  citizenship  in  the  Canadian  territory)  (Canadian  Citizenship  Act,  1976).      Citizenship  is  central  to  this  dissertation  because  citizenship,  as  demonstrated  by  

this  research,  significantly  defines  the  differentials  in  wages  of  low-skilled  workers   working  in  Canada.  The  existence  of  those  differentials  between  citizens  (and   permanent  residents)  and  non-citizens  challenge  citizenship  in  two  ways:  1)  as  argued   in  the  previous  chapter,  citizenship  is  used  as  a  means  to  allow  conditions  that  create   wage  differentials;  and  2)  the  presence  of  non-citizens  in  Canada  earning  lower  wages   than  nationals  challenge  core  values  associated  with  citizenship  such  as  justice,   fairness  and  universal  access  to  rights  while  within  Canadian  territory.  This  section   focuses  on  the  first  consideration.  The  following  section  then  explores  citizenship  as  a   vehicle  to  construct  migrants  as  workers  willing  to  accept  low  wages,  as  presented  in   previous  chapters.  
                                                                                                 
116

  Other  low-skilled  workers  develop  activities  that  permit  Canadians  to  have  comfortable  lives  (i.e.  low- skilled  workers  in  the  service  industry  sector)  and  they  also  earn  lower  wages  than  CB  and  IMM.

10.3.1.  Othering  and  citizenship  as  means  of  constructing  low-skilled  

TFWs.  Citizenship  is  a  means  used  by  policy  to  construct  otherness  (Sharma,  2001)   and  to  consolidate  ideologies  based  on  race,  ethnic  origin  or  religion.  Othering  and  the   construction  of  differences  serves  not  only  ideological  purposes  but  also  economic  and   political  ends,  functioning  to  justify  the  current  order  (Van  Houtum  &  Van  Naerssen,   2002).  The  outcomes  of  the  data  analysis  also  align  with  the  current  global  context,  in   which  Canada  uses  both  non-citizenship  and  its  position  as  a  country  with  power   inherited  from  a  colonial  past  to  access  cheaper  labour  (Plascencia,  2016).      The  immigration  system  is  designed  in  a  way  that  positions  high-skilled  workers  

as  potential  citizens  and  low-skilled  labourers  as  precarious  non-citizens  (Goldring  &   Landolt,  2013)  with  wages  below  those  of  the  Canadian-born  and  immigrant.    The  data   shows  that  `Low-skilled  non-citizen'  is  the  category  that  reflects  policies  that  allow   Canadian  employers  in  some  occupations  to  respond  to  profit  targets.  But  this  is  not  the   case  in  all  occupations,  as  was  shown  for  occupations  in  the  care  and  nursing  sector.   Some  occupations  genuinely  exhibit  shortages  that  only  foreign  labour  can  fulfill.   Nonetheless,  what  is  particularly  problematic  is  not  the  temporality  of  their  labour   situation  but  the  permanency  of  their  temporality  (Hennebry,  2012).  Even  if  there  is  a   genuine  demand  for  their  labour,  they  should  not  be  excluded  from  the  possibilities  of   integration  associated  with  citizenship.      The  low  wages  of  non-citizens  reflect  the  fact  that  citizenship  constructs  binary  

categories  that  define  people's  experiences  within  the  confines  of  geopolitical  borders,   including  protected/unprotected;  covered/uncovered;  with  access  to/without  access  to;   belong/do  not  belong,  temporary/permanent;  foreign/national;  migrant  non-

287  

     

citizen/immigrant  citizen.  Most  of  these  differences  respond  to  a  call  to  protect  those   members  of  the  polity,  at  the  same  time  enabling  indentured  labour  and  therefore  a   reorganization  of  the  labour  market  to  the  benefit  of  mainly  "capital  investors"  (Sharma,   2001,  p.427).  As  Sharma  (2001)  observes:   continued  reference  to  protecting  the  "nation,"  and  by  extension  those  seen  as   "belonging"  to  it,  allows  those  working  within  the  apparatuses  of  the  Canadian   state  to  reorganize  the  labour  market  in  Canada  by  recruiting  workers   categorized  as  "non-immigrants"  (or  in  the  vernacular,  as  "migrant  workers").   (p.418)  
  

The  conflict  arises  from  implementing  means  of  protection  at  the  expense  of  legitimizing   a  utilitarian  difference,  a  difference  that  benefit  us,  a  difference  that  is  not  diverse  but   unequal  (Sharma,  2001).  Thus,  labour  market  regulation  takes  place  via  migrant  labour:   "International  migrants  serve  as  an  illustrative  example  of  the  significance  of  non- market-driven  processes  of  labor-market  regulation  through  citizenship"  (Bauder,   2008a).  Low-skilled  temporary  foreign  workers  then  become  the  place  of  encounter  for   foreign  labour  markets  acting  within  the  boundaries  of  the  nation-state:  "The  dual   construction  of  a  "domestic"  and  a  "foreign"  labour  market  within  the  space  occupied  by   Canada  is  accomplished  through  the  category  migrant  worker"  (Sharma,  2001,  p.426).   Canada's  history  of  policymaking  is  no  exception  to  these  types  of  constructions.  Before   1967,  the  year  in  which  the  point  system  of  immigrant  selection  was  implemented,  race   was  the  main  means  for  selection  and  hence  for  granting  citizenship  (Kelley  &   Trebilcock,  1999).  Together,  segregating  along  the  lines  of  race  and  non-citizenship   have  allowed  Canadian  growers  to  compartmentalize  labour,  for  example,  by  using   Caribbean  and  Mexican  workers  in  specific  agricultural  fields,  and  to  become   competitive  (Gabriel  2016;  Preibisch  &  Binford,  2007).  It  is  the  outcome  of  a  long  history   of  colonial  domination  over  the  Caribbean  and  Mexico  (Gabriel,  2016),  as  also   288  
     

presented  in  chapter  three.         10.3.2.  Non-citizenship,  a  means  to  become  globally  competitive.  The  

Canadian  government  has  recognized  that  depriving  citizenship  to  low-skilled  foreign   workers  allows  the  country  to  enhance  competitiveness  by  locking  low-skilled  TFWs  into   low-skilled  occupations.  While  the  Canadian  government  did  try  to  increase  the  wages   of  low-skilled  workers  in  agriculture  in  the  early  stages  of  the  program  (Satzewich,   2008),  this  made  them  less  competitive  on  the  market,  so  wage  was,  once  again   lowered  (Satzewich,  2008).  Subjected  to  the  global  forces  of  the  market,  the  Canadian   government  has,  in  a  way,  lost  its  power  to  regulate  internal  markets  (Somers,  2008b).   This  is  the  consequence  of  choosing  to  organize  societies  based  primarily  on  market   principles  (Somers,  2008b)  as  they  are  reflected  in  power  relations:  "More  than  ever,   economics  has  become  ingrained  in  power  relationships,  and  leaders  are  just  beginning   to  sort  out  how  it  can  be  made  to  serve  larger  strategic  and  power  ends"  (Gelb,  2009,   p.39).  In  response  to  competitive  global  prices,  the  state  constructs  a  portion  of  its   labour  market  by  denying  them  right  to  permanency.  A  lack  of  labour  mobility   (dependency  on  the  employer)  is  a  key  element  in  the  structure  of  competitiveness   (Gabriel,  2016).  In  this  way,  migrant  workers  (predominantly  low-skilled  workers)  are   doubly  unfree:  1)  they  are  not  free  to  remain  in  their  home  countries  given  the  lack  of   possibilities  of  living  a  human  life  with  a  livable  wage;  2)  when  in  Canada  they  are  not   free  to  walk  away  and  sell  their  labour  to  a  better  employer  or  to  negotiate  their  own   labour  (Gabriel,  2016).  This  lack  of  freedom  has  been  enforced  by  policy  (Satzewich,   2008;  Sharma,  2006),  which  creates  a  vulnerable  exploitable  labour  force  whose  

289  

     

exploitation  is  enshrined  through  a  combination  of  a  lack  of  mobility,  precarious   employment  and  restrictions  on  bargaining  power  (Strauss  &  McGrath,  2016).           10.3.3.  Non-citizenship  in  combination  with  skills  (occupations)  as  another  

means  of  constructing  labour.  Through  their  elected  officials,  nation-states  construct   populations  (including  migrant  workers)  mainly  to  respond  to  their  electoral  agendas   (Schneider  &  Ingram,  1993).  Decisions  made  at  the  level  of  policy  to  respond  to   pressures  coming  from  different  stakeholders  in  specific  moments  in  history  make   migrants  indispensable  to  fulfill  economic  goals  (Satzewich,  2008).  Constructing  the   "other"  as  "alien,"  a  foundational  element  of  the  current  nation-state  (Sassen,  2003),   becomes  a  means  to  reap  economic  benefits  and  to  enhance  power  (Sharma,  2006).   Everything  beyond  its  borders  is  seen  as  a  potential  contribution  to  the  economy  of  the   nation-state.  However,  in  the  current  model  of  immigration  in  Canada,  the  type  of   construction  of  the  other  depends  on  its  human  capital  (skills).  Some  skills  are   constructed  as  necessary  and  some  are  blocked  via  political  action  (Steinberg,  1990).   Through  an  economic  lens,  considered  in  terms  of  the  value  of  various  skills,  policy   designates  the  other  according  to  its  potential  to  either  contribute  to  the  economic   system  or  drain  its  resources.  But  those  who  "threaten"  the  system  are  not  entirely   discarded.  They  are  recognized  for  their  potential  to  contribute  to  the  economy  in  a   temporary  way.      Elected  officials  and  bureaucrats  (as  mediators  between  the  polity,  stakeholders  

and  their  own  ideologies)  construct,  under  degrees  of  being  "essential,"  those  who  exist   outside  their  borders  according  to  their  skills.  This  construction  (via  citizenship  and  

290  

     

skills)  reflects  structures  of  power  and  privilege  that  reinforce  the  class  preference   identified  by  Jessop  (2014),  referred  to  in  the  previous  section:  "Insofar  as  skill  is  used   to  justify  pay,  power  and  privilege,  then  it  should  be  possible  to  analyze  skill  as  an   ideological  discourse"  (Steiger,  1993,  p.555).      In  this  dissertation,  wage  differences  show  that  the  type  of  occupation,  in  

combination  with  citizenship,  constructs  a  hierarchy  that  reinforces  structures  of  power   and  privilege  already  present  in  society:  "Although  different  occupations  develop   different  justifications  for  their  pay,  power  and  privilege,  there  are  also  basic,  more   commonly  shared,  social  values  about  skills  (i.e.  preferences  for  men  over  women,  or   whites  over  black,  mental  over  manual  skills)"  (Steiger,  1993,  p.555).  Only  those  with   skills  that  align  with  the  structures  of  power  are  embraced  as  citizens;  those  considered   to  be  unfit  are  embraced  only  by  the  labour  market,  embraced  by  temporality  via  non- citizenship;  citizenship  (or  lack  thereof)  transforms  them  into  mere  instruments  for   productivity  and  economic  growth.  The  rest  of  their  humanity  is  left  behind  (contrary  to   high-skilled  workers,  those  with  low  skills  are  not  allowed  mobility  in  the  labour  market,   not  allowed  to  receive  official  language  classes,  not  allowed  to  bring  their  families,  and   are  more  susceptible  to  exploitation)  (Basok,  2002;  Binford,  2009;  Faraday,  2012a).   Non-citizenship  has  a  specific  value:  it  allows  employers  to  access  a  labour  force  that  is   more  flexible  (and  thereby  more  valuable)  than  a  Canadian  labour  force  that  could  do   the  same  work  (Bauder,  2007).  As  citizenship  is  seen  as  a  form  of  capital  (Bauder   2008b),  non-citizenship  could  also  be  seen  as  a  form  of  capital  that  has  value  not  to   migrants  but  to  employers;  this  is  a  capital  whose  primary  currency  is  flexible  low-skilled   foreign  labour.  

291  

     

  

Foreign  low-skilled  labour,  then,  greatly  benefits  Canada,  by  providing  a  source  

of  capital  that  makes  the  Canadian  economy  more  competitive.  But,  to  what  extent  can   we  call  those  outcomes  "benefits"  if  they  are  obtained  at  the  expense  of  those  outside   the  circle  of  belonging,  by  subjecting  them  to  exploitative  conditions?  What  we  call   'benefits'  (i.e.  affordable  food  prices,  higher  productivity,  etc.)  are  the  direct  result  of  the   diminishment  of  other  people's  capacity  to  live  human  lives  (through  exploitation,  living   and  working  in  fear  of  losing  their  jobs,  broken  families,  broken  societies  in  their   countries  of  origin,  lower  wages,  etc.).  Is  it  ethically  justifiable  to  offer  TFWs  work  that  is   better  than  any  work  they  would  have  in  their  countries  of  origin  but  with  conditions   below  those  of  citizens  in  Canada?  Does  this  exploitative  situation  coincide  with   Canada's  charter  of  rights  and  freedoms?  Is  it  Canada's  responsibility  to  care  about  the   fate  of  TFWs'  families  and  their  societies?  If  belonging  via  citizenship  is  a  way  to   address  these  concerns,  further  research  should  focus  on  the  morality  of   granting/denying  rights  (including  citizenship)  to  low-skilled  foreign  nationals.         10.3.4.  Citizenship,  recognition  and  the  importance  of  collective  living.  

Hannah  Arendt  provides  a  foundation  to  justify  both  the  importance  of  low-skilled  labour   and  its  inclusion  in  a  society.  To  Arendt,  the  Greek  polis  represents  one  of  the  greatest   accomplishments  of  humanity  in  terms  of  social  organization.  She  argues  that  the  best   form  of  collective  life  emerges  in  an  organization  (like  a  nation-state  or  a  city-state)  that   allows  citizens  to  live  a  political  life  as  was  lived  by  the  citizens  of  the  ancient  Greek   polis.  Similarly,  the  data  suggests  that  non-citizens  allow  citizens  to  pursue  other   activities  (especially  in  occupations  where  non-citizen  workers  experience  the  larges  

292  

     

wage  differences  compared  to  citizens).  The  ancient  Greeks  recognized  that  the  power   to  create  emerges  only  when  individuals  are  released  from  necessity  and  can  exchange   in  issues  that  pertain  to  the  polis.  Freedom  was  understood  as  an  essentially  political   act,  reserved  for  those  who  engage  in  the  public  sphere;  it  emerges  only  when   individuals  have  been  freed  from  the  necessities  of  life  to  engage  in  political  issues  and   act  upon  matters  of  the  communities  in  which  they  reside  and  work.  Inspired  by   Aristotle,  Arendt  maintains  that  freedom  requires  "full  independence"  from  "the   necessities  of  life  and  the  relationships  they  originate"  (Arendt,  1998,  p.13-4).  Canadian   citizens'  ability  to  exercise  their  rights  and  freedoms  is  facilitated  by  the  marginalization   (oppression)  of  non-citizen  low-skilled  workers.      Necessity,  Arendt  explains,  is  marked  by  the  activities  that  pertain  to  the  actual  

human  biological  living,  like  the  occupations  dominated  by  the  outcomes  of  this   dissertation.  These  include  food  production,  cooking,  housekeeping,  etc.  Thus,  citizens   in  the  Greek  polis  possessed  the  logistical  conditions  that  allowed  them  the  time,   independence  and  peace  of  mind  to  participate  in  decision-making  processes  of  the   polis.  In  Ancient  Greece  times,  slaves  allowed  this  freedom  to  happen.  Nowadays  we   are  in  a  similar  situation  in  which  low-skilled  workers  (especially  those  with  the  lowest   wages)  perform  the  activities  that  slaves  developed  in  the  past.  While  Arendt   acknowledges  the  importance  of  low-skilled  labour  in  facilitating  citizens'  participation  in   the  matters  of  the  polis,  she  also  recognizes  the  relevance  (for  the  individual  and  the   collective)  of  recognition  (inclusion  via  citizenship)  and  the  relevance  of  embracing  the   other.  To  use  Arendt's  well  known  phrase,  citizenship  has  been  a  means  to  the  "right  to   have  rights"  (Arendt,  1976,  p.296).  Her  claim  brings  to  the  surface  the  relevance  of  

293  

     

recognition  in  the  context  of  the  nation-state  (Somers,  2008a).      The  limitation  of  this  recognition  is  that  it  was  conceived  based  on  the  idea  of  a  

general  individual,  a  human  being,  with  no  characteristics  linked  to  a  state.  This  idea  of   attaching  rights  to  the  individual  and  to  a  nation-state  comes  from  the  denial  of  rights   experienced  by  refugees  after  the  Second  World  War  (Somers  2008).  The  horrors  of   Europe  in  the  1930s  and  1940s  engendered  a  global  awareness  of  human  rights  across   the  western  world.  States  embraced  a  need  to  have  stronger  commitments  to  protecting   rights  of  individuals  and  collectives.  In  time  this  would  lead  to  the  Universal  Declaration   of  Human  Rights  and  the  Geneva  Declaration  of  Protection  of  Refugees.  This  also  had   some  influence  on  governments  moving  away  (officially)  from  race-based  immigrant   selection  polices.  This  situation  prompted  the  recognition  that  if  rights  are  denied  by   states,  there  still  remains  the  rights  of  `man'  (Arendt,  1976),  referring  to  the  rights   inherent  to  being  human,  that  is,  human  rights.        All  in  all,  Arendt  advises  that  acknowledging  plurality  (as  opposed  to  individuality)  

is  the  key  for  community  living  for  "men  exist  in  the  plural;"  no  human  being  exists  in  the   singular.  From  this  perspective,  it  is  compelling  to  think  of  human  existence  not  just  as   an  independent  biological  experience  but  as  both  individual  and  collective,  which   translates  into  considering  the  essence  of  humans  in  the  context  of  living  with  other   humans,  acknowledging  their  right  to  have  rights,  in  the  same  way  as  a  member  of  the   polis  do.  Those  living  in  my  midst,  living  human  lives,  require  recognition  within  the   circle  of  belonging,  which  is  granted  by  citizenship.  My  human  life  is  only  human  insofar   as  those  living  in  my  midst  also  live  human  lives,  and  human  life  is  only  lived  when  their   rights  are  recognized,  when  they  are  citizens.

10.4.  A  Way  Forward  with  Citizenship  (No  to  Non-citizenship)      The  previous  sections  have  all  approached  the  analysis  on  a  theoretical  level.  

This  section  will  now  gather  the  outcomes  of  the  previous  sections  and  will  propose   citizenship  for  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  workers  to  mitigate  the  differences  they   experience  compared  with  Canadian-born  workers  and  immigrants.      From  a  Rational  Theory  perspective,  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  workers  make  

the  decision  to  move  to  Canada  to  perform  low-skilled  jobs  after  pondering  the  pros  and   cons  of  staying  in  their  home  country  or  moving  temporarily  to  Canada.  Advantages   include  higher  wages;  better  labour  conditions  in  Canada  than  in  their  countries  of   origin;  the  possibility  of  education  for  their  children;  better  quality  of  life  for  their  children;   housing  improvements;  the  possibility  of  investing  back  in  their  countries  of  origin  and  in   their  local  communities  of  origin  (Binford,  2009;  Carvajal  &  Stallman,  2016).   Disadvantages  include  separation  of  the  family;  children  growing  up  without  one  of  their   parents  (sometimes  both);  housing  and  labour  confinement  in  Canada;  likelihood  of   being  exploited  in  Canada  (contrasted  against  the  possibility  of  even  greater  exploitation   in  their  countries  of  origin);  compared  to  Canadians,  poor  living  conditions  (which  are   even  worse  in  their  home  country);  highly  physically  demanding  activities  (similar  to   those  in  their  country  of  origin)  and  likely  health  and  safety  issues  (that  may  trigger   deportation)  (Basok,  2001a;  Carvajal  &  Stallman,  2016;  Hennebry,  2012;  Preibisch,   2014;  Preibisch  &  Binford,  2007).      Power  asymmetries  inherited  from  a  colonial  past,  in  combination  with  policies  

designed  to  favour  the  few  in  Canada,  use  and  abuse  Canada's  position  of  power  at  the   expense  of  those  with  no  possibilities  in  their  countries  of  origin.  This  use  is  presented

as  being  beneficial  for  all  (country  of  origin,  country  of  destination,  employers  and   workers).  And  in  many  ways  it  is.  Workers'  families  do  have  a  possibility  of  a  better  living   and  children  do  have  improved  access  to  education  and  communities  in  the  countries  of   origin  do  improve.  However,  the  program  as  it  is,  that  is,  without  access  to  citizenship,   creates  subclasses  in  Canada  (low-skilled  temporary,  undocumented,  racialized  groups)   and  fractures  societies  abroad.  It  is  a  system  that  not  only  validates  but  makes  use  of   the  exploitative  structures  operative  in  the  workers'  countries  of  origin.  It  is  a  system  that   that  achieves  competitive  prices  here  by  dividing  families  and  eroding  societies  abroad.      As  a  non-neutral  broker  (mediator  of  shifting  forces  and  interests),  the  Canadian  

state  has  designed  non-citizenship  programs  that  benefit  Canada  economically.  While   this  is  true,  it  is  also  true  that  Canada  is  immersed  in  a  larger  economic  system  that   transcends  its  borders.  From  an  economic  perspective,  external  forces  rule  over   Canada's  productivity  in  some  industries.  This  is  especially  evident  in  agriculture,  where   Canadian  businesses  face  significant  challenges  to  hire  Canadian-born  or  immigrants   (Conference  Board  of  Canada,  2016).  Canadian  decision-makers,  however,  especially   in  the  era  of  P.  M.  Harper,  went  beyond  the  demands  of  global  competition  by  creating   policies  that  plummeted  wages.  Policies  encouraged  employers  to  access  increasingly   cheaper  labour.  Neoliberal  ideologies  looking  for  markets  'free'  from  government   intervention  (or  even  deeper  government  intervention  by  lowering  barriers  to  cheap   foreign  labour)  set  in  motion  a  system  of  permanent  temporality,  which  catalyzed  a  race   to  bottom  of  the  lowest  wages  legally  allowed  in  Canada.  Additionally,  the  Canadian   state  also  constructs  in  a  top-down  way  skills  and  occupations  through  a  system  blind  to   skills  essential  to  the  economy.  In  contrast,  the  outcomes  of  this  dissertation  (and  their  

296  

     

associated  critique)  could  provide  a  way  to  rethink  the  system  with  a  bottom­up   approach,  by  creating  new  categories  that  better  respond  to  the  reality  of  low-skilled   labour  in  the  context  of  the  current  global  labour  market.  Future  studies  could  explore  a   new  structure  created  from  the  data  itself  and  not  from  pre-conceived  categories.      Although  some  low-skilled  non-citizens  are  paid  high  wages  in  some  occupations  

(see  section  6.3.2.  in  chapter  six),  many  are  paid  at  wages  lower  than  Canadian  born   and  immigrant  workers.  As  chapter  six  showed,  low-skilled  workers  in  seven   occupations  (mainly  in  agriculture  and  caregiving)  have  a  high  concentration  in  the   lowest  wage  quartiles  (see  section  6.3.1.  in  chapter  six).  These  seven  occupations   represent  52%  of  all  NPRs  (see  Table  8  in  chapter  six).  Some  have  wages  even  lower   than  minimum  wage  (see  section  6.3.3.  in  chapter  six)  and  some  are  paid  lower  wages   than  Canadian-born  workers  or  immigrant  employed  in  the  same  occupation.  A  lack  of   citizenship  has  become  the  primary  means  for  policymakers  to  construct  both  a  need  for   foreign  labour  and  the  foreign  labourers  themselves:  only  non-nationals  from  specific   countries  are  capable  and  willing  to  perform  those  activities.  Thus,  globalization,   neoliberal  ideologies,  lack  of  citizenship,  power  asymmetries  on  a  global  scale  and  a   loss  of  power  at  the  national  level  have  been  the  key  contributing  factors  driving  the   current  system  that  provides  Canada  with  cheap  labour.      Ideally,  it  should  be  possible  for  globalization  to  work  for  all.  But  humanity  first  

needs  to  move  toward  a  system  of  global  democracy,  this  referring  to  processes  of   decision  making.  Global  democracy  will  need  to  be  accompanied  by  processes  of   inclusion  of  minorities,  of  acceptance  of  diverse  populations  and  of  redistribution  of   wealth.  A  system  that  protects  individual  economies  continues  to  divide  and  reap  

297  

     

benefits  at  the  expense  of  others  with  less  power.  Some  people  are  trapped  in  the   misfortune  of  being  born  in  countries  with  "bad"  citizenship.  Those  in  the  global  North   may  be  counted  as  having  the  fortune  of  free  movement  between  countries  and  better   labour  conditions.  In  contrast,  those  in  the  global  South  have  the  misfortune  of   restrictions  to  move  to  the  global  North  and  of  being  locked  in  low-skilled/low-wage   occupations.  However,  neoliberalism  also  transforms  the  reality  of  those  with  "good"   citizenships,  as  evidenced  by  sharply  rising  levels  of  income  inequality  in  most  Western   countries  (Piketty,  2014).  A  global  democracy  that  looks  after  the  entire  human  race   should  be  a  long-term  goal  (Sassen,  2003).      In  the  meantime,  countries  like  Canada,  that  use  foreign  labour  and  have  

immigration  policies  in  place,  should  allow  low-skilled  workers  a  pathway  to  citizenship.   This  should  be  done  because  it  is  just  (it  is,  in  the  words  of  Arendt,  "human")  to  allow   every  person  who  works  on  Canadian  soil  and  contributes  to  the  Canadian  economy  to   have  the  same  treatment  and  same  benefits  that  citizens  have.  As  long  as  global   economic  forces  outside  Canada  continue  to  influence  the  national  economy,  while  the   world  reaches  a  situation  that  leads  it  into  global  governance,  Canada  should  find  a   better  balance  between  its  economic  goals  and  the  demands  for  justice  stemming  from   the  Canadian  Charter  of  Rights  and  Freedoms.      Agricultural  workers,  the  group  most  exploited  among  low-skilled  workers,  should  

be  the  first  to  be  considered.  The  Conference  Board  of  Canada  showed  the  increased   need  for  agricultural  workers  and  the  desire  of  employers  in  agriculture  to  have  a   pathway  to  permanent  residence  for  agricultural  workers  (Conference  Board  of  Canada,   2016).  Manitoba  is  already  using  the  PNP  as  a  way  to  solve  agricultural  labour  needs  

298  

     

(Conference  Board  of  Canada,  2016).  The  primary  limitation  is  that  there  are  no  federal   pathways  for  low-skilled  workers  (other  than  LICs).  A  question  that  still  remains  is,  if  a   pathway  to  permanent  residence  (and  citizenship)  is  granted  to  agricultural  workers,   would  they  stay  in  agriculture?  This  would  require  further  research.  However,  most  of   these  workers  are  agricultural  workers  in  their  countries  of  origin  (e.g.  Mexico).  One   potential  approach  could  be  applying  the  pathway  to  citizenship  of  the  Live-in  Caregiver   Program  to  agricultural  workers.  Given  that  the  Canadian  Charter  of  Rights  and   Freedoms  guarantee  freedom  of  mobility,  the  workers  could  not  be  attached  to  an   industry  as  permanent  residents  nor  as  citizens.  Research  shows  that  involving   communities  and  employers  working  together  in  settlement  activities  help  in  retaining   foreign  workers  (Palacio,  2010).  Therefore,  the  federal  government  could  put  in  place  a   type  of  time-bounded  initial  temporary  resident  status  (with  guaranteed  permanent   residence)  attached  to  the  industry.  The  temporary  status  would  serve  as  a  period  to   help  in  the  process  of  integration  between  the  workers  and  the  communities  while  they   remain  in  the  same  industry.    For  example,  three  years  in  a  temporary  resident  status   linked  to  agriculture,  but  with  the  freedom  to  change  employers  if  needed.  Then  they   would  have  ensured  permanent  residence.  The  temporary  status  would  grant  workers   freedom  to  move  between  their  country  of  origin  and  Canada,  while  allowing  them  to   work  in  agriculture  only  for  the  length  of  the  temporary  status.  Afterwards  they  would  be   free  to  change  industries  (if  desired),  although  the  hope  is  for  them  to  stay  in  both  the   industry  and  the  communities  of  residence.        In  spite  of  its  hardships,  the  agricultural  program  is  a  program  that  Mexican  

workers  seek  (Carvajal  &  Stallman,  2016).  Each  year,  about  26  000  workers  come  to  

299  

     

Canada  to  work  in  Canadian  farms  on  a  temporary  basis.  Of  the  26  000,  more  than  90%   have  come  more  than  once  (IRCC,  2016b)  to  work  in  Canada,  pay  taxes  and  contribute   to  Canada  Pension  Plan  (Faraday,  2012a).  Some  of  them  have  been  coming  for  more   than  25  years  (Faraday,  2012a).  One  worker  was  found  to  have  been  coming  for  31   years  (Carvajal  &  Stallman,  2016).  While  many  of  them  would  like  to  move  to  Canada,  it   may  not  be  easy  as  they  have  deep  roots  in  Mexico.  Others  would  prefer  to  continue  to   come  and  go  between  Canada  and  Mexico  (Carvajal  &  Stallman,  2016).  Not  all  would   want  to  move  to  Canada,  but  they  should  have  the  option  of  doing  so.      Workers  in  other  occupations  should  also  be  given  the  chance  to  become  

permanent  residents  since  many  of  them  end  up  staying  for  up  to  four  years,  working   and  paying  taxes.  In  response  to  those  who  would  like  the  possibility  of  moving  freely   between  Canada  and  their  country  of  origin,  the  Canadian  government  might  consider  a   type  of  citizenship  that  eases  their  mobility.  This  citizenship  has  to  guarantee  that  they   receive  all  the  benefits  that  Canadians  have,  including  access  to  language  classes,   equal  wages  to  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  workers  and  education  for  their  children,   when  desired.            Summary   In  addition  to  the  discussion  in  this  chapter,  this  thesis  makes  significant  

empirical  and  theoretical  contributions.  This  dissertation  provides  three  significant   takeaways  from  the  quantitative  analysis,  all  presented  in  chapters  five,  six,  seven  and   eight.      First,  in  scoping  out  a  profile  of  low-skilled  labour  in  Canada,  this  study  uncovers  

300  

     

its  prevalence  in  three  occupations:  retail,  caregiving  and  agriculture.  Second,   citizenship  matters;  there  is  a  non-citizenship  wage  penalty  for  NPRs;  there  are   variations  in  labour  market  experiences  linked  to  citizenship  status.  As  chapter  six   shows,  1)  Of  the  35  occupations  analyzed  for  wage  differences,  31  had  negative   differences  and  4  had  positive  differences.  This  demonstrates  that  non-citizens  had   lower  wages  than  immigrants  and  Canadian-born  workers  in  about  89%  of  the   occupations  analyzed.  2)  In  some  occupations  wages  improve  when  citizenship  is   accounted  for  among  foreign-born  low-skilled  workers  born  in  the  same  country.  Third,   wages  and  labour  market  experiences  exhibit  hierarchical  structures  among  NPRs.   Wages  and  general  labour  market  experiences  linked  to  specific  characteristics  like   province  of  residence,  rural/urban  location  and  country  of  birth,  exhibit  hierarchical   structures.  As  chapter  seven  shows,  1)  Low-skilled  NPRs  tend  to  have  larger  negative   wage  differences  (when  their  wages  are  compared  to  those  of  the  CB  and  IMM)  in   Ontario  than  those  of  low-skilled  workers  in  other  provinces;  2)  Wage  differences  (of   NPRs  compared  to  the  CB  and  IMM)  in  rural  areas  are  negative  and  larger  (in  absolute   value)  than  those  in  urban  areas  (which  are  all  negative  too);  3)  Those  coming  from   mostly  European  countries  with  high  official  language  ability  work  in  the  better  paid  low- skilled  occupations.  In  contrast,  highly  physically  demanding  occupations  are  filled  with   workers  coming  mostly  from  the  developing  world;  4)  In  some  occupations  wages   improve  when  citizenship  is  accounted  for  among  foreign-born  con-nationals.  For   example,  cross-tabulation  shows  that  the  wages  of  Mexican-born  immigrants  (with   citizenship)  working  in  occupation  8431-General  farm  workers  are  considerably  higher   than  those  of  Mexican  NPRs  working  in  the  same  occupation.  This  is  also  confirmed  via  

301  

     

regression  analysis.  Compared  to  low-skilled  Canadian-born  workers,  low-skilled   immigrants  earn  7%  less,  which  is  not  very  distant  from  the  wages  of  the  Canadian- born.  In  contrast,  low-skilled  NPRs  (without  citizenship)  earn  almost  20%  less  than   those  born  in  Canada.  This  means  that  for  the  most  part  having  access  to  citizenship   does  indeed  increase  the  possibility  of  earning  better  wages.      Other  relevant  contributions  include  a  detailed  description  of  the  place  of  low-

skilled  labour  in  Canada  and  a  ground-breaking  demographic  profile  of  low-skilled   labour,  both  in  chapter  five.  The  profile  draws  on  the  2015  labour  force  survey  as  well  as   on  the  2006  census  data  providing  two  different  time  frames  (2006  and  2015)  and   general  overview  characteristics  of  low-skilled  labour  with  citizenship  in  contrast  with   low-skilled  labour  without  citizenship.  The  analysis  showed  that  whereas  retail  is  the   occupation  with  the  highest  number  of  low-skilled  workers  in  Canada,  caregiving  and   agriculture  have  the  highest  number  of  low-skilled  non-citizens  (NPRs).  It  also  shows   that  sex,  not  surprisingly,  is  a  factor  among  low-skilled  NPRs  concentrated  in  caregiving.   Additionally,  the  Philippines  and  Mexico  were  the  dominant  countries  of  origin  for  non- citizens.      The  regression  analysis  in  chapter  eight  introduces  11  regression  models  to  

analyze  low-skilled  labour  in  Canada.  The  outcomes  of  those  models  confirm  what  I   showed  in  the  descriptive  chapters  (six  and  seven),  namely,  that  low-skilled  non-citizens   earn  lower  wages  than  their  Canadian-born  and  immigrant  counterparts.  Chapter  nine   shows  that  the  literature  corroborates  what  was  systematically  shown  in  this   dissertation:  differences  in  labour  market  outcomes  are  linked  to  a  lack  of  citizenship      My  dissertation  also  presents  contributions  at  the  level  of  policy,  methodology  

302  

     

and  theory.  In  chapter  three,  the  dissertation  provides  a  critical  historical  analysis  of  the   emergence  of  Canadian  policies  on  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  labour  and  the  factors   which  it  shaped  it.  The  analysis  confirms  the  policy  origins  of  low  wages  among  low- skilled  non-citizens  and  reaffirms  the  policy  process  reflecting  the  emergence  of   stereotypes  linked  to  constructed  characteristics  of  workers  including  skills  capacity,   work  ethic  and  sex.      As  described  in  chapter  four,  the  methodology  of  my  dissertation  makes  a  

contribution  by  using  2006  census  data  and  quantitative  methods,  including  cross   tabulation  and  regression  analysis  to  show  the  impact  that  a  lack  of  citizenship  has  on   low-skilled  workers'  wages.  The  use  of  the  2006  census  is  critically  important  because  it   captures  the  beginning  of  the  exponential  increase  of  low-skilled  temporary  foreign   labour  in  Canada  described  in  the  literature.  Additionally,  this  analysis  considers   variables  that  have  not  been  previously  analyzed  together  in  the  context  of  all  low- skilled  occupations  in  Canada.  Variables  include  sex,  province  of  residence,  rural/urban   location  and  country  of  birth.  This  study  takes  a  deep  dive  into  low-skilled  labour  data   that  has  not  been  explored  before.  The  level  of  granularity  this  study  engages  yields   also  granular  outcomes  permitting  a  more  focalized  use  for  policy  and  program   development.      Finally,  chapter  ten  provides  a  theoretical  contribution.  This  chapter  has  shown  

that  a  Rational  Choice  lens  (understood  as  decisions  reached  according  to  self-interest)   does  not  provide  the  entire  picture  of  the  situation  of  low-skilled  workers.  A  Critical   Social  lens  sheds  critical  light  on  the  way  in  which  the  state,  as  a  biased  negotiator  of   powers,  uses  a  lack  of  citizenship  as  a  means  to  favour  capital  (in  a  capital  labour  

303  

     

dynamic).  This  chapter  showed  that  agendas  based  on  individualistic  principles  have   benefited  Canada's  use  of  low-skilled  labour  but  all  too  often  at  the  expense  of  the  lives   of  people  without  Canadian  citizenship.  It  elaborates  the  ways  in  which  a  policy  design   based  exclusively  on  Rational  Choice  Theory  keeps  noncitizens  captive  in  a  perennial   cycle  of  non-belonging.  Perennial  non-citizenship  in  low-skilled  occupations  should   therefore  not  be  the  means  to  increasing  productivity.  Canada  could  and  should  lead  the   way  towards  justice  and  fairness  by  providing  low-skilled  workers  with  a  pathway  to   citizenship.  This  should  be  a  pathway  that  ensures  low-skilled  TFWs'  equal  wages  and   labour  experiences  than  those  of  the  CB  and  IMM  as  well  as  a  steady  and  stable  supply   of  low-skilled  labour  to  the  Canadian  economy.  Low-skilled  TFWs  should  also  be  eligible   for  access  to  language  training  and  other  settlement  services.  As  evidenced  in  this   dissertation,  ability  to  speak  one  of  Canada's  official  languages  is  one  of  the  elements   that  structures  a  hierarchy  of  occupations  among  NPRs.  Allowing  low-skilled  TFWs   access  to  language  training  would  be  a  way  to  level  a  hierarchy  created  by  a  system   that  constructs  skills,  occupations  and  wages  differences.  By  providing  a  pathway  to   citizenship  and  access  to  settlement  services  to  low-skilled  workers  (especially   agricultural  workers)  Canada  would  lead  the  way  in  promoting  economic  efficiency  as   cherished  by  Neoclassical  Economics  in  a  context  of  social  justice  as  cherished  by   Critical  Social  Theory.

Appendix  1  -  Regression  -  Ordinary  Least  Square  method.   In  a  binary  relationship  of  two  variables  (one  dependent  variable  and  one   independent  variable),  this  method  looks  for  the  closest  estimated  parameters  of  a  line   that  would  pass  through  a  set  of  observed  values  of  both  dependent  and  independent   variables.  
  

  

For  a  set  of  observed  values  (a  set  of  values  of  the  independent  variable),  X  can   be  established  a  linear  relationship  with  a  set  of  observed  values  of  a  dependent   variable  y.  For  a  set  of  observed  values,  this  relationship  can  be  expressed  as  follows:  

 =  +    
305  
     

The  OLS  method  looks  for  the  smallest  distance  between  the  observed  values   and  a  fitted  line.  The  method  minimizes  the  differences  between  each  observation  and   the  estimated  values  of  a  line  that  passes  through  the  observations.   Thus  for  a  straight  line

   =  +    

The  OLS  looks  for  the  minimal  distance  vis-a-vis  the  observed  values.  The   method  minimizes  the  sum  of  squared  residuals  (errors)  which  is  equivalent  to   minimizing  the  sum  of  squared  differences  between  the  observed  dependent  values  and   the  observed  independent  values.  For  one  set  of  observations  of  a  single  independent   variable  related  to  one  set  of  observations  of  one  dependent  variable,  the  problem  to  be   solved  would  be:  

e

  (, )    (, )    =   
df? e

dA   

                                                            =
df?
Where:  
 =  Intercept    =  Coefficients    =  Error  

d -  - d A   

The  solution  to  this  problem  of  minimization  lies  in  finding  the  coefficients  (betas)   and  the  intercept  (alpha)  that  makes  those  distances  minimal.  Using  different   mathematical  procedures  (including  derivatives),  the  estimated  betas  and  the  alpha  are   306  
     

calculated.  These  coefficients  (betas)  provide  information  about  the  relationship  of   variability  between  the  independent  variable  and  the  dependent  variable,  when  the   other  predictors  are  held  constant  (so  their  variability  or  derivative  with  respect  to  the   dependent  variable  is  equal  to  1).  Transformations  and  considerations  specific  to  the   regression  analysis  are  included  in  the  chapter  five  (on  regression  analysis).

1.   Title  of  the  Project  

The  value  of  citizenship:  A  comparison  of  labour  market  outcomes  of  low-skilled   temporary  foreign  workers  with  those  of  other  low-skilled  workers  in  Canada.  
   2.   Rationale  and  objectives  of  the  study           Clearly  identify  the  specific  questions  or  objectives  of  the  project.      State  how  the  research  will  contribute  to  the  knowledge  in  the  field  of  

study  by  summarizing  the  current  literature  and  identifying  the  gap(s)  to  be   addressed.   This  research  focuses  on  low-skilled  workers  and  citizenship.  It  has  generally   been  assumed  that  citizens  have  better  lives  than  non-citizens,  as  citizenship  is  seen  as   the  mechanism  providing  workers  with  an  instrument  of  legal  and  economic  protection   as  well  as  status.  But  does  citizenship  make  a  difference  vis-à-vis  the  outcomes  in  the   labour  market  when  a  worker  is  low-skilled?  To  answer  this  question,  my  research  will   compare  the  outcomes  in  the  labour  market  of  three  groups  of  low-skilled  workers:  Low- skilled  Non-Permanent  Residents  -  LS-NPRs  (in  this  research,  low-skilled  refugees  and   low-skilled  TFWs),  low-skilled  immigrants  (permanent  residents  and  naturalized   immigrants  -    LS-IMM)  and  low-skilled  Canadian-born  workers  (LS-CB).   My  PhD  research  will  answer  the  question:  How  do  the  outcomes  in  the  labour   market  of  low-skilled  citizens  and  permanent  resident  workers  compare  to  those  of  low- skilled  temporary  foreign  workers  in  Canada?  Some  research  that  looks  into  the   outcomes  in  the  labour  market  of  low-skilled  workers  can  be  cited.  High-skilled   immigrant  workers  in  the  United  States  (Borjas,  1985)  and  in  Canada  (Janz,  2004)  have   higher  earnings  growth  than  low-skilled  immigrant  workers.  In  Canada  elements  like   country  of  origin  significantly  determine  wage  growth  (Aydemir  &  Skuterud,  2005;  Bloom   et  al.,1995;  Pendakur  &  Pendakur,  2002;);  low-skilled  immigrants  in  the  United  States   drive  wages  down  on  low-skilled  intensive  jobs  (Cortes,  2008).  No  definitive  negative   effects  on  the  native-born  wages  in  the  United  States  are  observed  in  places  where   immigrants  reside  (Borjas,  1996).  Others  found  that  evidence  that  low-skilled   immigrants  harm  the  native-born  opportunities  is  scant  (Card,  2005).  In  Canada,  Zhang   (2002)  shows  that  less  skilled  immigrants'  accumulation  of  skills  and  labour  stability   increases  wage  growth  among  low-skilled  immigrants.     A  gap  in  the  literature  can  be  identified  for  there  are  not  many  quantitative   approaches  that  exclusively  address  low-skilled  labour  in  Canada.  Contrary  to  the   exploration  of  rights-related  aspects  of  low-skilled  labour  migration,  econometric  and   quantitative  analysis  of  the  broader  low-skilled  labour  in  Canada  has  not  been  widely   examined.  Derrick  Thomas  (2010)  from  Stats  Canada  presents  an  examination  of   temporary  foreign  workers  in  Canada.  His  study  makes  a  profile  of  LS-NPRs  in  Canada.   While  this  study  identifies  some  differences  between  LS-NPRs  and  provides  information   308  
     

on  some  low-skilled  NPRs,  the  focus  of  the  study  is  the  broader  group  of  TFWs.  This   research  addresses  that  gap.   The  research  will  address  this  question  through  two  theoretical  lenses:  Rational   Theory  (RT)  and  Social  Critical  Theory  (SCT).  RT  is  chosen  because  it  provides  a   framework  for  systematic  quantitative  analysis  to  analyse  patterns  and  because  it  is   broadly  used  in  policymaking  circles.  However,  this  theory  may  be  blind  to  ethical  issues   that  may  arise.  Therefore,  the  study  will  also  draw  on  a  Social  Critical  Theory  lens   (based  on  Marxist  analysis),  which  provides  a  framework  to  evaluate  value-related   issues.  Social  Critical  Theory  will  be  especially  useful  to  reinterpret  the  quantitative   analysis,  especially  the  evaluation  of  the  value  of  citizenship  as  a  means  for  economic   betterment.   This  question  is  relevant  for  three  reasons:  First,  there  seems  to  exist  a  sort  of   hierarchy  of  labour  market  outcomes.  LS-NPRs  may  be  near  the  bottom  of  this   hierarchy.  This  research  intends  to  gauge  the  extent  to  which  this  is  true.  Second,   comparing  labour  market  outcomes  among  LSNPRs,  LS-IMM  and  LS-CB  provide   another  piece  of  information  that  will  contribute  to  the  debate  on  the  integration  in  the   labour  market  of  low-skilled  workers.  Third,  the  research  will  enhance  the  debate  on  the   value  of  citizenship  as  a  door  to  better  labour  market  outcomes  and  as  an  instrument  for   economic  protection.   Keeping  in  mind  that  the  labour  market  is  sensitive  to  industries  and  occupations,   considering  the  labour  market  outcomes  of  LS-NPRs  and  other  low-skilled  workers  in   the  Canadian  labour  market  leads  to  the  following  hypothesis:     1.  LS  NPRs  employment  income  is  much  lower  than  that  of  LS-CB  or  than  that  of   LS-IMM,  or  than  that  of  HSILS.     2.  LS-NPRs  work  more  hours  per  week  than  LS-CB  and  more  than  LS-IMM  
   3.   Proposed  data  analysis  and  software  requirements           What  is  the  proposed  statistical  methodology?  How  is  it  suitable  for  this  

project?   This  research  has  two  main  components:  one  that  requires  a  quantitative   analysis  and  one  that  requires  qualitative  analysis.  The  confidential  data  will  be  used  in   the  quantitative  part.  The  qualitative  part  will  use  the  outcomes  of  the  quantitative  part  to   question  the  value  of  citizenship  among  low-skilled  individuals  vis-à-vis  their  outcomes   in  the  labour  market.  The  quantitative  part  will  use  2006  census  data.  The  analysis  will   focus  on  the  labour-market  outcomes  by  occupation  and  industry  for  each  of  the  groups   under  scrutiny  (LS-  NPRs,  LS-IMM  and  LS-CB).     Using  statistical  analysis  methods,  the  research  will  look  into  variables  that   represent  the  outcomes  in  the  labour  market  of  low-skilled  workers  and  will  gauge  their   relationship  with  variables  that  either  represent  intrinsic  characteristics  or  external   determinants.  To  accomplish  this,  the  analysis  will  focus  on  comparing  variables  within   the  groups  and  between  groups.  The  analysis  will  require  the  following  statistical   309  
     

methodologies:   Variable  correlation  analysis  to  evaluate  correlations  between  intrinsic  characteristics   of  the  workers  and  their  outcomes.  These  characteristics  will  include  gender,  age  and   education.  This  type  of  analysis  will  keep  in  mind  the  types  of  variables117  to  be   compared  and  the  number  of  independent  variables.  For  example,  if  both  independent   and  dependent  variables  are  categorical  their  relationship  will  be  tested  using  Chi- square  Test.   Linear  Regression  analysis  to  gauge  the  effects  of  the  explanatory  variables  in  each   group  including  gender,  age,  province  of  residence,  level  of  education,  industry  and   occupation  on  the  variables  chosen  to  evaluate  the  outcomes  in  the  labour  market   (namely,  wages  and  hour  of  labour).  This  will  provide  another  element  of  analysis  to   quantify  how  much  these  variables  contribute  to  changes  on  the  variables  that  represent   the  outcomes  in  labour  market.       Regression  analysis  to  predict  the  effect  of  each  independent  variable  on  the   dependent  variables.        Will  the  volume  of  descriptive  statistics  be  greater  than  that  of  a  typical   RDC  proposal  (i.e.,  35­50  frequencies  or  crosstabs)?  If  yes,  please   explain.   No      What  software  will  be  utilized?   The  research  will  use  SPSS   4.   Data  requirements   The  research  will  use  2006  census  data.  Census  data  is  preferred  since,  contrary   to  other  databases  with  labour  force  information,  the  census  contains  information  of  all   groups  to  be  compared  including  TFWs.  The  research  will  only  choose  low-skilled   workers  (LS-NPRs,  LS-CB  and  LS-IMM)  
      An  explanation  of  why  access  to  the  confidential  data  (as  opposed  to  

public  use  microdata  files)  is  necessary.   The  research  was  initially  going  to  use  the  2006  Public  Use  Microdata  File   (PUMF).  However,  the  PUMF  data  file  was  insufficient.  Selection  of  low-skilled   temporary  foreign  worker  cases  was  based  on  the  following  criteria:  those  who  are   employed;  between  the  ages  of  18-65;  those  whose  earnings  are  between  0  dollars  and   99,000  dollars;  working  full  time;  selecting  only  those  who  are  TFWs  and  refugee   claimants  (excluding  foreign  students  from  the  temporary  resident  population).  After  this   selection,  a  cross  tabulation  of  the  immigration  status  variable  with  the  occupations   variable  and  selecting  only  those  in  low-skilled  occupations,  the  total  cases  of  low- skilled  TFWs  was  reduced  to  (563).  This  number  in  the  sample  is  too  small,  which  make   comparisons  with  the  other  populations  of  low-skilled  workers  difficult.

Therefore,  the  next  step  is  to  use  the  entire  population  present  in  the  2006   census.  The  whole  population  of  NPRs  in  the  2006  census  is  over  112  000  cases   (Thomas,  2010).  Having  access  to  the  entire  population  from  the  2006  census  solves   the  difficulties  that  the  PUMF  sample  presents  regarding  sample  size  and  allows  a  more   solid  analysis.  The  entire  population  permits  a  more  comprehensive  comparison   between  LS-NPRs  with  LS-CB  and  LS-IMM.      Which  survey  file/files  or  cycles  are  to  be  used?           Will  the  number  of  data  sets  be  greater  than  that  of  a  typical  RDC   proposal  (i.e.,  1­3  datasets)?  If  yes,  please  explain.   No      Will  datasets  be  linked  in  any  fashion  to  other  Statistics  Canada   datasets  or  other  data  sets?  If  you  plan  to  combine  data  from  more   than  one  source  in  your  analysis,  please  provide  adequate  detail  on   how  the  data  from  each  source  will  be  combined  in  this  analysis.  In   particular,  your  description  should  outline  whether  you  plan  to   combine  data  from  2  or  more  sources  to  increase  your  sample  size;   or  to  link  aggregate  contextual  data  to  the  micro-records;  or   whether  your  plan  is  to  link  micro-  record  to  micro-record  together   from  2  or  more  sources.  Should  you  plan  latter  please  be  advised   that  a  second  approval  process  is  required  by  senior  management   at  Statistics  Canada  and  that  the  linkage  must  be  conducted  at   Statistics  Canada.  Additionally,  there  may  be  a  fee  for  these   services.  If  yes,  please  explain  the  nature  of  this  record  linkage  and   its  intended  purpose.   No  other  datasets  will  be  used      Provide  a  statement  that  the  confidential  data  file(s)  identified  is  (are)  in   fact  suitable  for  the  proposed  research.      What  are  the  variables  to  be  used?   This  research  will  require  looking  at  several  variables  including:  employment   earnings,  hours  of  labour  and  type  of  work.  These  will  be  considered  in  relation  to   variables  including  gender,  age,  education,  immigrant  status,  occupation  and  industry  of   labour.  Using  social  critical  theory,  the  qualitative  part  will  analyze  the  quantitative   findings  through  the  light  of  the  main  developments  on  citizenship  from  a  value   perspective.  The  labour  market  outcomes  will  be  analyzed  in  terms  of  the  following  key   variables.

Appendix  3A  -  Distribution  in  the  Unweighted  PUMF  files   From  an  immigration  status  perspective,  Table  A1  presents  the  distribution  of  the   subsample  (the  unweighted  PUMF  file).  Calculations  in  this  section  are  only  indicative.   They  only  demonstrated  the  unsuitability  of  the  PUMF  files.

The  distribution  of  the  unweighted  PUMF  files  already  makes  evident  the   smallness  of  the  populations  in  the  PUMF  files  (especially  the  temporary  resident   population).  The  approximate  7K  NPRs  in  the  PUMF  files  contrast  with  the  112  identified   by  Thomas  (2010)  for  the  entire  Census.  This  raises  a  flag  indicating  the  PUMF  files   may  not  be  enough  and  that  the  research  may  have  to  use  the  whole  census.   Continuing  with  the  PUMF  files  analysis,  an  even  smaller  population  was  required  for   the  analysis:  the  low-skilled  population.   `  
  

Population  required:  Individuals  who  in  2005,   ·   were  working  in  low-skilled  occupations,   ·   who  were  employed  in  a  paid  full-time  job,  

315  

     

·   between  the  ages  of  18  to  65,   ·   with  earnings  not  higher  than  99,000  dollars  per  year  (used  only  as  an  indicative   value).   ·   Some  variables  were  used  to  select  the  population.   Case  Selection   For  mathematical  and  analytical  considerations,  the  populations  of  low-skilled   workers  need  to  be  comparable.  The  following  are  the  criteria  used  to  select  the   population  in  the  PUMF  files:   ·   Employed  (vis-a-vis  unemployed):  All  TFWs  are  employed.  Hence,  individuals  in   the  other  two  populations  (low-skilled  CB  and  and  low-skilled  IMM)  must  also  be   employed.  The  variable  "labour  force  activity"  lfact  allows  selecting  only  those   employed.  `Labour  force  activity'  refers  to  the  "labour  market  activity  of  the   population  15  years  of  age  and  over  in  the  week  (Sunday  to  Saturday)  prior  to   Census  Day  (May  16,  2006)."  (Respondents  were  classified  as  `Employed,'   `Unemployed,'  or  `Not  in  the  labour  force.'   ·   Employed  (vis-a-vis  self-employed):  All  TFWs  are  employed,  not  self-employed.   The  variable  "class  of  worker"  cow,  permits  this  selection.  This  variable  classifies   persons  who  reported  a  job  into  the  following  categories:  (a)  paid  worker  (b)  self- employed  worker.   ·   Between  the  ages  of  18-65.  This  was  done  through  the  variable  agegrp   ·   With  employment  earnings  below  99  000  dollars:  Although  it  is  very  unlikely  that   there  will  be  low-skilled  workers  with  high  levels  of  income,  this  first  approach   considers  only  those  whose  earnings  are  between  0  dollars  and  99  000  dollars   316  
     

during  the  year  2005.  This  was  done  through  the  variable  wage.   ·   Working  in  full-time  jobs:  Temporary  Foreign  Workers  coming  under  Foreign   Worker  Programs  work  in  full-time  jobs.  Individuals  in  the  other  populations  must   be  working  in  full-time  jobs.  The  full-time  or  part-time"  variable  (fptwk)  allowed   this  selection.   ·   Excluding  foreign  students  and  including  TFWs  and  refugee  claimants.  From  the   group  of  Non-Permanent  Residents  (TFWs,  foreign  students,  refugee  claimants,   and  people  with  temporary  resident  visas  under  humanitarian  grounds).  With  the   PUMF  sample  the  initial  focus  was  on  TFWs,  but  it  was  not  possible  to  separate   the  three  groups.  Only  foreign  students  could  be  separated  from  the  sample.  The   variable  "attendance  at  school"  attsch  was  used  to  extract  foreign  students  from   the  sample.  A  more  detailed  explanation  on  the  selection  of  refugees  and  the   extraction  of  foreign  students  from  the  NPR  population  is  included  later  in  this   chapter  (in  the  section  Selection  of  population:  criteria  and  considerations  prior   data  extraction).   Without  separating  low-skilled  from  high-skilled,  a  cross  tabulation  with  the   immigration  status  variable  shows  the  distribution  in  Table  A2:

·   Low-skilled  only:    Using  the  variable  nochrd,  low-skilled  workers  were  selected  by   choosing  only  those  working  in  low-skilled  occupations.  Nochrd,  refers  to  the   "kind  of  work  persons  were  doing  during  the  reference  week,  as  determined  by   their  kind  of  work  and  the  description  of  the  main  activities  in  their  job.   Employment  equity  groups  are  defined  based  on  the  National  Occupational   Classification  (NOC)"  (PUMF  files  dictionary  2006,  page  65).  The  following  table   (Table  A3)  shows  the  distribution  after  separating  the  low-skilled  population.

The  total  number  of  low-skilled  temporary  foreign  workers  (563)  in  the  sample  is   too  small,  which  makes  comparisons  among  low-skilled  workers  difficult.    This  is  the   case  because  this  research  explores  the  outcomes  in  the  labour  market  of  different   kinds  of  low-skilled  workers,  which  requires  dividing  the  sample  even  more.  Therefore,   the  next  possible  option  is  using  the  entire  population  present  in  the  2006  census,  for   the  entire  population  of  TFWs  in  it  is  over  112  000  cases.   Accessing  this  information  required  presenting  a  project  plan  to  the  Stats  Canada   Research  Data  Centre  (RDC)  at  the  University  of  Toronto,  (see  Appendix  2).    Having   access  to  the  entire  population  from  the  2006  census  solves  the  difficulties  that  the   318

Appendix  3B  -  Variables  Definitions  extracted  from  the  Stats  Canada's  2006   Census  2006   According  to  information  gathered  from  the  Statistics  Canada  website,  the  2006   census  has  six  main  questionnaires:  the  2B  (long  form),  the  one  used  in  this  research.   The  Form  2B,  or  long  Population  Questionnaire,  "collects  information  of  1/5  of  all  usual   residents  of  all  private  dwellings."  (Statistics  Canada,  2013).  The  long  form  samples  one   in  five  households  (20%).  This  form  used  to  be  mandatory  but  was  replaced  by  a   voluntary  form  in  2011.  This  new  form  provided  the  information  collected  in  the  2011   National  Household  Survey  (NHS).  These  changes  have  introduced  problems  of   reliability  to  the  information  collected.  According  to  Elliot  (2010),  the  change  from   mandatory  to  voluntary  is  problematic  in  three  different  ways:  1)  communities  with  low   response  rates  are  suppressed,  which  leaves  some  communities  with  no  reliable   information.  2)  a  significant  level  of  non-response  bias  appears  when  the  characteristics   of  respondents  and  non-respondents  are  different.  Large  non-response  rates,  as  it  is   the  case  in  the  2011  NHS,  exacerbate  biases.  3)  the  information  is  used  as  a  reference   for  other  surveys,  which  in  a  way  replicates  the  inaccuracy  present  in  the  NHS.   Following  I  include  the  list  of  literal  definitions  of  the  variables  I  used  in  the  analysis,   they  are  extracted  from  the  2006  Census  Codebook:   Aboriginal  Status  and  Visible  Minority  Status  (DVISMIN):"The  visible  minority   group  to  which  the  respondent  belongs.  The  Employment  Equity  Act  defines   visible  minorities  as  'persons,  other  than  Aboriginal  peoples,  who  are  non- Caucasian  in  race  or  non-white  in  colour'.  'South  Asian'  includes,  for  example,   East  Indian,  Pakistani,  Sri  Lankan,  etc.  'Southeast  Asian'  includes,  for  example,   Vietnamese,  Cambodian,  Malaysian,  Laotian,  etc.  'West  Asian'  includes,  for   example,  Iranian,  Afghan,  etc.  'Visible  minority  n.i.e.'  includes  respondents  who   reported  a  write-in  response  such  as  Guyanese,  West  Indian,  Kurd,  Tibetan,   Polynesian,  Pacific  Islander,  etc.  'Multiple  visible  minority'  includes  respondents   who  reported  more  than  one  visible  minority  group  by  checking  two  or  more   320  
     

mark-in  circles,  e.g.,  'Black'  and  'South  Asian'.  'Aboriginal  self-reporting  'includes   respondents  who  reported  'Yes'  to  the  Aboriginal  identity  question  (Question  18):   these  respondents  were  not  required  to  answer  the  Population  Group  question"   (Statistics  Canada,  2008b,  p.969).  
  

Attendance  to  School:  "Attendance  at  school  -  refers  to  attendance  during  the   nine-month  period  between  September  2005  and  May  16,  2006.  An  individual's   attendance  could  be  either  full-time  or  part-time  (day  or  evening),  even  if  the   individual  dropped  out  after  registration.  Attendance  was  counted  only  for   courses  which  could  be  used  as  credits  towards  a  certificate,  diploma  or  degree   from  a  recognized  educational  institution  (elementary  or  secondary  school,   registered  apprenticeship  programs,  trade  schools,  colleges,  CEGEPS  and   universities).  Recognized  education  institutions  also  included  seminaries,  schools   of  nursing,  private  business  schools,  private  or  public  trade  schools,  institutes  of   technology,  vocational  schools,  or  schools  for  people  who  are  deaf  or  blind.   School  attendance  was  not  counted  for  training  received"  (Statistics  Canada,   2008b,  p.85).      The  categories  of  this  variable  are:

Appendix  3C  -  2006  NOC  System  of  Classification  of  Occupations      The  2006  NOC  classification  groups  more  than  30  000  job  titles  in  520  

occupational  groups  (NOC  4).  Occupational  groups  refer  to  the  grouping  of  jobs   according  to  skill  types,  skill  levels,  industry  and  occupational  mobility.  Occupational   groups  are  also  known  as  NOC4  occupations  and  it  refers  to  the  four-digit  label   assigned  to  each  occupational  group.  NOC4  occupational  groups  are  regrouped  in  3   digit  groups,  also  known  as  NOC3  groups.  These  groups  are  subsequently  grouped  into   two  digit  groups,  also  known  as  NOC2  groups  or  Major  Groups.  These  groups  are   subsequently  grouped  in  1  digit  groups,  also  known  as  NOC1  groups  or  Skill  Type   groups.      For  example,  NOC1  group  "8"  corresponds  to  the  Skill  Type  Group  "Natural  

Resources,  Agriculture  and  Related  Production  Occupations".  This  group  is  made  up  of   the  following  NOC2  groups  (two  digit  groups):   ·   Major  Group  82  -  Supervisors  and  technical  occupations  in  natural  resources,   agriculture  and  related  production   ·   Major  Group  84  -  Workers  in  natural  resources,  agriculture  and  related   production   ·   Major  group  86  -  Harvesting,  landscaping  and  natural  resources  labourers   The  Major  Group  84  gathers  the  following  NOC3  subgroups  (3  digits  groups):   ·   841  -    Mine  service  workers  and  operators  in  oil  and  gas  drilling   ·   842  -    Logging  and  forestry  workers   ·   843  -    Agriculture  and  horticulture  workers   ·   844  -  Other  workers  in  fishing  and  trapping  and  hunting  occupations   329  
     

  

The  NOC3  group  843  "Agriculture  and  horticulture  workers"  gathers  the  following  

NOC4  occupational  groups  (4  digit  groups):   ·   8431  -  General  Farm  Workers   ·   8432  -  Nursery  and  Greenhouse  Workers      NOC  1  groups  or  skill  type  groups  sort  occupations  according  to  broad  groups  

that  can  be  either  "a  function  (management,  clerical,  sales)  or  a  subject  matter,   (science,  health,  social  science,  culture,  skilled  trade)  or  industry  (primary  industry,   manufacturing)"  (Roberts,  2003,  p.5).  Ten  skill  types  are  identified.  Skill  types  are  the   following:   ·   ·   ·   ·   ·   ·   ·   ·   ·   ·  
  

0  -  Management   1  -  Business,  Finance  &  Administration;   2  -  Natural  and  Applied  Science,  and  Related  Occupations;   3  -  Health  Occupations;   4  -  Occupations  in  Social  Science,  Education,  Government  Service  and  Religion;   5  -  Occupations  in  Art,  Culture,  Recreation  and  Sport;   6  -  Sales  and  Service;   7  -  Trades  and  Skilled  Transport  and  Equipment  Operators;   8  -  Occupations  unique  to  Primary  Industry;   9  -  Occupations  unique  to  processing,  manufacturing,  and  utilities.       
  

These  classifications  are  then  presented  in  a  matrix119  that  includes  the   occupational  groups,  occupation  types  and  skill  levels.

Appendix  6  -  Procedure  to  Calculate  the  Anova  (Sirkin,  2006)   1.   The  sum  of  squares  within  groups  is  calculated  (SSWG).  This  is  equal  to   summing  the  squared  differences  of  each  observation  minus  the  mean.  
e

(d - i )A                        
df?

Where,   n=  number  of  observations  in  each  group  (same  for  all)  
i   =  Mean  of  group  k  

m  =  Number  of  groups   Then,  all  totals  of  each  sum  are  added.  The  SSWG  then  is:  
k e

   =    (

(
df? df?

(d - i )A ))  

2.   The  observations  of  all  groups  are  put  together  and  treated  as  one  supergroup.   The  mean  and  variance  (squared  differences  of  observations  minus  the  mean)   for  this  supergroup  is  calculated.  The  same  procedure  used  for  the  samples  in   step  1  is  followed  for  this  new  supergroup.  Then,  the  Total  Sum  of  Squares     (TSS)  is:                 =
l df?(d

-      )A   

  =  Mean  of  the  supergroup     =  Total  number  of  observations  of  supergroup   336  
     

3.   Then,  the  Sum  of  Squares  Between  Groups  (SSBG)  is  calculated.  This  requires   summing  the  squared  differences  between  the  mean  of  each  group  and  the   mean  of  the  super  group.  Then  this  result  is  multiplied  by  the  number  of  cases,   which  is  the  same  in  each  group.  
k

   =    
df?

(i -      )A   

4.   As  a  test,     =      +       5.   Then,  each  sum  of  squares  is  divided  by  its  number  of  degrees  of  freedoms.   Each  division  is  the  Mean  Square  Between  Groups  (MSB)  and  the  Mean  Square   Within  Groups  (MSw)  respectively.   a.   MSb  =  (/  (    ))    =   /(       -   1)         MSb  =  (/  (    ))    =     /  ( - 1)   b.   MSw  =  (/  (    ))    =   /( - )   MSw  =  (/    ))    =   /( - )   6.   The  the  F  value  (the  ratio  between  these  two  relations)  is  calculated:      =    (/( - 1))/((/( - ))    = /   7.   F  value  and  the  degrees  of  freedom  (of  SSBG  and  of  SSWG)  are  contrasted  in   an  F  distribution  to  see  whether  the  null  hypothesis  is  accepted  or  rejected.

Appendix  7  -  Bonferroni  Test:  According  to  Williams  (2004),  The  Least  Significant   Difference  Test  between  group  i  and  group  j  consists  of:     x - y  =         z

 =          ... z... =                           The  outcome  has  a  T  distribution  with  N-J  degrees  of  Freedom,  where   N=  Number  of  observations   J  =  Number  of  Groups   According  to  Williams,  the  Bonferroni  test,  "multiplies  each  of  the  significance   levels  from  the  LSD  test  by  the  number  of  tests  performed,  i.e.  J*(J-1)/2.  If  this  value  is   greater  than  1,  then  a  significance  level  of  1  is  used."  (Williams,  2004).                     338  
     

Appendix  8  ­  Low-Skilled  population,  wage  dispersion  (broad  wage  range)  and   high  wages  in  the  fourth  quartile   As  explained  in  chapter  five,  high  dispersion  leads  to  high  wages  in  the  fourth  quartile   and,  by  extension,  to  high  mean  wages  for  the  whole  population  in  each  occupation.   Therefore,  it  is  important  to  try  to  explain  why  high  dispersion  (high  wages)  occurs.   Different  sources  of  wage  dispersion  have  been  identified:   1.   In  terms  of  numbers  of  workers  and  numbers  of  occupations,  there  are   differences  linked  to  the  actual  skill  level.  Skill  level  C  includes  a  higher  number   of  workers  and  occupations  than  skill  level  D.  Whereas  level  C  has  70  low-skilled   occupations  with  NPRs,  level  D  has  only  28.   2.   Differences  are  also  reflected  in  wage  levels.  Occupations  in  level  C  tend  to  have   higher  wages  than  occupations  in  level  D.  Average  wages  for  skill  level  C  vary   from  $14.35/hour  for  the  NPR  population  to  $17.37/hour  for  the  Canadian-born   population.  In  contrast,  average  wages  for  the  skill  level  D  vary  from  $13.08/hour   for  the  NPR  population  to  $15.57/hour  for  the  Canadian  born  population.  But   variation  is  not  only  caused  by  the  skill  level;  there  is  also  variation  within  each   occupation.  While  these  averages  are  high  (above  minimum  wage),  in  Annex  9   (Quartile  analysis),  about  half  of  NPRs  in  almost  each  occupation  earn  wages   around  the  average  minimum  wage.  The  next  section  provides  a  more  detailed   account  of  how  wages  are  distributed  in  each  occupation  in  the  quartiles   analysis.   3.   Wage  variation  is  not  only  caused  by  the  differences  in  skill  levels;  other  factors   also  affect  wage  dispersion.  As  with  the  industry  sector  classification,  wages  at   339  
     

the  occupational  group  level,  though  more  precise  in  terms  of  zeroing  in  on  the   activities  for  which  remuneration  is  received,  still  have  significant  occupational   variance  group-wide.  Besides,  even  though  NOC  4  occupations  are  the  last  level   (publicly  available)  in  which  labour  activities  are  classified  and  accounted  for,   NOC  4  occupations  also  groups  significantly  diverse  jobs.  For  example,  whereas   occupation  NOC  6474  (Babysitters,  Nannies  and  Parent  Helpers)  groups  10   possible  job  titles,  occupation  8431  -  General  Farm  Workers  groups  more  than   160  job  titles.  Jobs  in  this  occupation  include:  apiarian  technician,  general  farm   worker,  harvester  machine  operator  and  milking  machine  tender  (Government  of   Canada,  2017).  This  broad  diversity  of  jobs  may  also  have  an  impact  on  wage   dispersion.  Thus,  a  limitation  of  this  research  is  that,  even  in  the  smallest   available  category  (occupational  groups  or  NOC4  occupations),  some  of  the   wages  group  together  a  significant  number  of  jobs.  This  affects  wage  dispersion   within  each  occupational  group.  Given  that  there  is  no  information  about  wages   at  the  actual  job  level,  it  is  not  possible  to  know  the  jobs  of  those  with  low  wages   and  of  those  with  high  wages  within  each  occupational  group.   4.   Another  source  of  dispersion  is  linked  to  the  fact  that  wages  of  most  low-skilled   occupations  are  close  to  the  minimum  wage,  which  varies  from  province  to   province.  The  minimum  wage  in  Canadian  provinces  in  2005  varied  from   $6.15/hour  in  Newfoundland  to  $8.0/hour  in  British  Columbia.  In  2005,  the   minimum  wage  in  Ontario  was  $7.43/hour,  in  Quebec  $7.55/hour  and  in  Alberta   $6.27/hour  (Government  of  Canada,  2016).   5.   While  wages  in  some  low-skilled  occupations  are  close  to  the  minimum,  not  all  

340  

     

are  remunerated  at  a  minimum  wage.  For  example,  according  to  the  The   Government  of  Canada's  tool,  job  bank,  the  average  for  Ontario  in  occupation   9482  "Motor  vehicle  assemblers,  inspectors  and  testers"  ranged  from   $15.75/hour  to  $35/hour  (Government  of  Canada,  2017a).  The  2006  census   identified  some  NPRs  working  in  this  occupation.   6.   Dispersion  is  also  the  consequence  of  different  levels  of  seniority  in  each   occupation.  High  wages  may  reflect  high  levels  of  seniority  in  a  job.  Wages  in  all   immigration  statuses  are  not  all  entry-level  wages.  Wages  reported  in  this   research  correspond  to  the  average  wage  of  both  those  who  worked  for  the  first   time  in  2005  in  a  specific  low-skilled  occupation  and  those  who  have  been   working  for  many  years  in  the  same  occupation.  Some  low-skilled  NPRs  in  the   agricultural  sector  come  year  after  year  to  work  in  the  same  occupation  (Basok,   2000).  Finally,  not  all  occupations  classified  as  low-skilled  are  low  wage.

Appendix  9  -  Quartiles  Analysis   This  appendix  presents  the  wage  differences  of  the  combined  second  and  third   quartiles  by  province  of  residence;  sex;  rural/urban  location;  prime  age;  speaking/not   speaking  English;  speaking/not  speaking  French;  and  level  of  education.  Average   wages  for  NPRs,  CB  and  IMM  per  quartiles  are  presented  top  to  bottom  for  the  top  20   occupations  of  NPRs.   Average  wages  of  NPRs  in  the  first  and  second  quartiles  in  most  occupations   exhibit  wages  below  the  minimum  wage.  When  the  third  quartile  is  added,  wages  are  a   little  above  the  average  minimum  wage  for  Canada  in  2005  ($7.15/hour).

The  value   of  25%  comes  after  rounding.  Additionally,  the  total  percentages  in  those  tables  differ  from  those  in  table   8.  The  reason  for  those  differences  relates  to  the  actual  number  of  cases  per  quartile.  While  Appendix   10B  (CB)  and  Appendix  10C  (IMM)  gather  hundreds  of  thousands  of  cases  per  quartile,  table  8  (NPRs)   gathers  only  a  few  thousands  per  quartile.  This  also  reflects  the  very  low  proportion  of  TFWs  in  the  labour   force  (about  1.7%)  described  in  chapter  one.

Appendix  14A  -  Regression  Analysis  -Considerations  (Decisions).     This  section  presents  the  decisions  made  throughout  the  regression  analysis.  It   reports  on  the  categories  chosen  as  reference  in  each  variable  and  helps  to  clarify  both   the  meaning  of  the  outcomes  as  well  as  how  to  read  them.  Several  transformations  took   place  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  the  independent  variables  (age,  sex,  level  of  education,   occupation,  etc.)  on  the  dependent  variables  (average  hourly  wages):        -    Hourly  wages  transformed  into  LOG  hourly  wages.  This  transformation  

makes  it  possible  to  gather  information  in  percentages  on  the  impact  that  changes  in  the   independent  variables  (characteristics)  have  on  the  dependent  variable  (hourly  wages).   Transforming  wages  into  LOG  wages  also  helps  normalize  the  distribution  of  wages,   which,  as  mentioned  above,  is  a  requirement  of  regression  analysis.    
  

-.  Immigration  Status:  Three  categories  are  included  in  this  variable.   a.   Canadian-born  (Reference  category/control)121   b.   Immigrant  and  Permanent  Resident   c.   Non-Permanent  Resident  (Temporary  Foreign  Worker  and  Refugee  Claimant).     For  the  regression  analysis,  it  was  necessary  to  split  the  immigrant  group:   immigrants  who  came  to  Canada  at  the  age  of  10  or  younger  were  added  to  the  group   of  Canadian-born  workers.  This  transformation  was  needed  to  correct  effects  for   collinearity.122  It  also  reflects  the  observation  that  immigrants  who  arrive  in  Canada  at  an  
                                                                                                 
121

  Regression  analysis  requires  one  of  the  subcategories  in  each  independent  variable  to  be  the  group   against  which  the  other  subcategories  in  that  variable  are  compared  when  the  other  independent   variables  are  held  constant.           122   Collinearity  effects  between  two  or  more  categories/variables  are  present  when  the  observations  in   each  of  them  are  similar  in  magnitude,  proportion  or  value.  Having  different  categories/variables  with   similar  magnitudes/proportions/values  in  a  regression  model  makes  it  difficult  to  separate  the  effects  of   each  of  them  on  a  dependent  variable.

early  age  tend  to  have  better  official  language  skills  than  those  who  arrive  later  in  life.   First  language  proficiency,  in  turn,  facilitates  a  smoother  integration  into  the  Canadian   labour  market,  comparable  to  that  of  a  Canadian-born  worker.  As  chapter  six   demonstrated,  the  mean  wage  of  immigrants,  considered  as  a  whole,  is  a  bit  lower  than   that  of  Canadian-born  workers,  but  not  as  low  as  that  of  NPRs  (see  Table  13).  In   contrast,  the  mean  wage  of  low-skilled  immigrants  who  were  10  or  younger  upon  arrival   in  Canada  is  slightly  above  that  of  Canadian-born  workers  (7%  higher).  Their  labour   market  outcomes  (in  terms  of  wages)  are  closer  to  the  CB  population  than  to  the   immigrant  population  (as  a  whole).  As  a  result,  including  this  subpopulation  with  the  CB   group  enriches  the  analysis  not  only  because  it  avoids  collinearity  effects,  but  also   because  it  places  a  subpopulation  with  a  population  that  has  similar  outcomes  (wages).   This  was  also  the  most  elegant  solution  in  view  of  the  sample  size  of  this  group,  which   is  too  small  to  be  considered  as  a  separate  population  but  too  large  to  be  withdrawn   from  the  population  without  distorting  results  by  excluding  an  important  part  of  the   labour  force.     The  new  group,  entitled  "Canadian-born  recoded,"  is  the  immigration  status   control  group,  since  it  is  worth  seeing  how  the  other  two  groups  (NPRs  and  IMM)  fare   against  the  CB.  Hence,  the  group  "Immigrants"  in  the  regression  analysis  includes  only   immigrants  who  arrived  after  the  age  of  10  who  are  either  naturalized  citizens  or   permanent  residents.  As  in  the  cross  tabulation  analysis,  the  group  "NPRs"  includes   TFWs,  refugee  claimants  and  people  with  temporary  resident  visa  on  humanitarian   grounds.     

362  

     

  

-.  Rural-Urban  location.  As  with  the  Wage  differences  analysis,  the  regression  

analysis  also  includes  a  rural  /  urban  analysis.  This  part  of  the  analysis  considers  Urban   as  the  reference  category.      -.  Provinces  and  Territories  Groups:  Some  provinces  and  territories  had  to  be  

grouped  together  regionally  because  of  sample  size.  The  number  of  low-skilled  workers,   especially  TFWs,  was  so  small  that  a  provincial  level  analysis  by  immigration  status  was   not  possible.  While  this  grouping  allows  analysis  of  a  region  at  the  occupation  level,  it   may  also  hinder  the  analysis  since  economies  vary  from  province  to  province.  The   following  groupings  took  place:   1.   Atlantic  Provinces  were  grouped  together  as  one  region.   2.   Manitoba,  Saskatchewan  and  Alberta  were  also  grouped  together  as  a  single   region.     3.   All  Territories  were  grouped  together  as  one  region.   Quebec  was  chosen  as  the  control  province  because  it  has  a  large  economy  and   a  significant  degree  of  variability  in  terms  of  the  number  of  low-skilled  occupations.   Having  Quebec  as  the  control  province  also  facilitates  analysis  of  outcomes  in  Ontario,   which  is  the  province  with  the  largest  number  of  TFWs  and  the  greatest  variability  vis-a- vis  the  number  of  low-skilled  occupations  using  temporary  foreign  labour.         -  Level  of  education:  Cases  were  divided  into  to  three  categories.   1.   High  school  and  less  (reference  category)   2.   College  degree  and  trade  certificate   3.   University  degrees  (including  Bachelor,  Master  and  PhD)  

363  

     

High  school  and  less  was  chosen  as  the  control  group  to  highlight  the  effect  of   earning  an  education  on  employees  working  in  low-skilled  occupations.         -  World  regions:  13  world  regions  of  origin  were  considered  including,   ·   2  -  3  Canada,  United  States,  Greenland  and  St.  Pierre  et  Miquelon  (reference   category  -  control  region.)   ·   4  -  Central  America,  South  America  and  the  Caribbean   ·   5  -  West,  North  and  Central  Europe   ·   6  -  Eastern  Europe  and  USSR  (all  ex-Soviet  Union  countries  and  Eastern   Europe)   ·   7  -  Southern  Europe  -  (e.g.  Spain  and  Portugal)   ·   8  -  Sub  Saharan  Africa  (except  South  Africa,  Namibia  and  Swaziland)   ·   9  -  South  Africa,  Swaziland,  Namibia  and  Oceania123   ·   10  -  North  Africa  and  the  Middle  East  (it  includes  Turkey  and  Cyprus)     ·   11  -  India   ·   12  -  Far  East  Asia  1  (e.g.  Japan  and  South  Korea)       ·   13  -  Far  East  Asia  2  (e.g.  Cambodia  and  Vietnam)     ·   14  -  South  East  Asia  excluding  India  (e.g.  Pakistan,  Sri  Lanka,  Afghanistan  and   Nepal)   ·   15  -  China     

                                                                                                 
123

  This  group  gathers  those  not  fitting  in  the  other  groups;  their  outcomes  were  not  statistically  significant   due  to  very  small  sample  size.  

364  

     

Age.  In  this  analysis  age  was  mean  centered,  which  means  that  the  mean  age  was   subtracted  from  each  recorded  age.  This  makes  it  possible  to  recognize  the   contribution  of  age  in  determining  wages.  Since  this  is  a  continuous  variable,  the   variations  between  age  and  the  dependent  variables  were  measured  by  each  additional   year.   First  official  language  spoken.  All  cases  were  grouped  according  to  two  specific   groups:   1.   Speaking  either  official  language  (English,  French  and  Bilinguals)  (reference   category)   2.   Not  speaking  either  official  language   Sex:  Male  (reference  category)  and  females:  The  regression  analysis  compares  the   wages  of  all  low-skilled  females  against  the  wages  of  all  low-skilled  males  included  in   this  study,  females  being  the  reference  group.  This  comparison  aims  to  evaluate  the   incidence  of  being  female  on  wages  vis-à-vis  males.       Low-Skilled  Occupations  (98  Occupations).  Control  Occupation  Census  code  315   (NOC  4  code  -  6663)  Janitors,  caretakers  and  building  superintendents  was  chosen  as   the  control  occupation.  This  occupation  has  the  closest  average  hourly  wage  to  the   mean  for  all  occupations.  It  is  also  the  occupation  with  the  highest  number  of  cases   close  to  the  mean  (for  all  occupations).  By  including  all  occupations,  it  is  possible  to   gauge  how  each  occupation  fares  against  the  average  low-skilled  wage,  which,  in  turn,   provides  an  indication  of  the  differences  among  low-skilled  occupations  in  the  Canadian   labour  market.

Appendix  15  ­  Supply-Demand  Analysis   From  a  labour  economics  perspective,  some  industries/occupations  may  be  seen   as  supply-excess  driven.  In  these  cases,  wage  is  mostly  defined  by  external  forces.   Thus,  the  fact  that  NPRs  have  lower  wages  than  "nationals"  could  be  interpreted  as  an   alteration  of  the  regular  labour  conditions  of  a  "controlled"  labour  market  in  specific   occupations.   Graph1:  Labour  demand  and  supply  in  a  supply-excess  situation.  

  

Graph  1  shows  the  effects  on  the  labour  force  of  foreign  labour  working  for  lower   wages.  The  graph  shows  that  for  a  labour  demand  in  an  industry/occupation  x  there  is  a   labour  supply  that  is  satisfied  with  the  defined  labour  market  (national  labour  market)  in   an  equilibrium,  Eq.  1,  with  wages,  W1.  When  those  conditions  are  altered  by  a  labour   force  that  is  willing  to  do  the  same  jobs  for  lower  wages,  W2,  the  equilibrium  between   demand  and  supply  moves  to  a  new  position,  Eq.  2,  with  lower  wages  and  a  larger   labour  force.  However,  a  new  equilibrium  with  lower  wages  has  been  shown  to  also   affect  the  wages  of  nationals  in  those  specific  industries/occupations  (Borjas,  2004).   369  
     

      

     

Graph  2:  Labour  demand  and  supply  in  a  supply-deficit  situation   Other  occupations  may  be  seen  more  on  the  supply-deficit  driven  side.  Some   occupations  experience  a  genuine  supply  shortage.  Supply  makes  demand  move  to  a   new  equilibrium  with  higher  wages.  Thus,  on  the  other  extreme  of  the  industrial   spectrum  there  are  industries  with  NPRs  earning  wages  above  those  of  the  Canadian- born  and  immigrant  population.  While  this  may  be  the  case,  it  is  important  to  remember   that  a  significant  dispersion  is  present  on  the  hourly  wages  of  low-skilled  workers.  This   may  mean  that  averages  are  not  very  representative  of  the  sample.  This  will  be  later   addressed  at  the  occupation  level  with  the  quartile  analysis  (included  in  the  annexes   section).               370  
     

Appendix  16  ­  Table  A13:  Summary  of  All  Hypotheses  

Table  14  C  -  Summary  of  All  Hypothesis/   Cross-Tabulation-  Absolute  Wages   Hypothesis   1.  NPRs  earn  lower   wages  than  CB  and   IMM  in  all  industry   sectors  and  occupations   in  this  study.   Findings   1.1.  Low-skilled  workers  in  the  Agriculture,  forestry,  fishing  and  hunting   industry  sector  earn  the  lowest  wages  (an  average  of  $10.10/hour).  They  were   followed  by  workers  in  the  `Other  Services'  sector  (except  public   administration),  averaging  approximately  $10.20/hour.  This  is  a  composite   service  sector  and  includes  caregiving  occupations  (wages  include  room  and   board),  which  comprise  the  largest  number  of  NPRs.     1.2.  Low-skilled  NPRs  earned  lower  wages  than  CB  and  IMM  in  11  out  of  the   13  industry  sectors  analyzed.  However,  large  wage  dispersion  (a  few  cases   with  high  wages  in  each  occupation)  makes  an  occupation  level  analysis   necessary.   2.  Babysitters  and  nannies  had  the  lowest  absolute  wages  (not  accounting  for   room  and  board)  among  the  43  occupations  analyzed.  They  were  followed  by   low-skilled  workers  in  agricultural  occupations.  However,  mean  wages  were   rather  high.  High  mean  wages  are  related  to  wage  dispersion.   3.  Just  over  half  of  all  NPRs  (52%)  work  in  only  7  occupations  which  exhibit   high  concentration  of  NPRs  in  low  wages;  12  occupation  have  a  high   concentration  around  high  wages  (they  represent  30%  of  all  NPRs)   4.  Low-skilled  NPRs  reported  lower  wages  than  CB  and  IMM  in  most   occupations.  Of  the  43  analyzed,  35  occupations  passed  the  Bonferroni  test   and  had  enough  counts  (more  than  90).  Of  these  35  occupations,  in  31  NPRs   had  lower  wages  than  CB  and  IMM.  In  the  remaining  four  occupations,  the   NPR  mean  wages  were  above  CB  and  IMM  mean  wages.  The  quartile   analysis  showed  that  out  of  these  four,  only  one  (Truck  Drivers)  offered   genuinely  higher  wages  for  NPRs.  Occupations  6474-Babysitters,  Nannies  and   Parents  Helpers;  8432  Nursery  and  Greenhouse  Workers  and  8433-General   Farmworkers  are  among  the  occupations  with  the  lowest  wages  among  the   NPR  population  and  with  the  highest  wage  differences  compared  with  CB  and   IMM.   Cross-  Tabulation  Relative  Wages   Hypotheses   1.  NPRs  earn  lower   wages  than  CB  and   IMM  by  sex  and   occupation  analyzed  in   this  section.   2.  NPRs  earn  lower   wages  than  CB  and   IMM  in  all  provinces  in   each  occupation   analyzed  in  this  section.   3.  NPRs  earn  lower   Findings   2.1.  Females:  Of  the  14  top  occupations  tested,  six  had  statistically  significant   outcomes,  all  of  which  with  NPR  wages  lower  than  CB  and  IMM  wages.   2.2.  Males:  Of  the  top  14  occupations  for  males  tested,  six  exhibited   statistically  significant  lower  wages  for  NPRs  compared  with  CB.  10  of  the  14   exhibited  statistically  significant  lower  wages  for  NPRs  compared  with  IMM.   2.  Province  of  Residence:  Wage  differences  among  NPRs  compared  to  CB   and  IMM  are  greater  in  Ontario  than  in  other  provinces.  In  all  occupations  with   statistically  significant  results,  NPR  wages  were  lower  than  those  of  CB.   Occupation  6474-Babysitters,  Nannies  and  Parents  Helpers  displayed  the   largest  differences.   3.1.  Rural:  Wages  among  NPRs  are  lower  than  those  of  IMM  in  the  two

wages  than  CB  and   IMM  in  rural  and  urban   locations  in  each   occupation  analyzed  in   this  section.   4.  NPRs  earn  lower   wages  than  CB  and   IMM  by  level  of   education  in  each   occupation  analyzed  in   this  section.  

occupations  with  statistically  significant  results.  Differences  with  the  CB   population  were  negative  in  the  five  occupations  with  statistically  significant   results.   3.2.  Urban:  NPR  wages  were  lower  than  those  of  CB  and  IMM  in  all  seven   occupations  with  statistically  significant  outcomes.  Differences  in  Urban   settings  were  larger  for  6474-Babysitters,  Nannies  and  Parents  Helpers.   4.  In  the  top  10  occupations  tested,  NPRs  earn  less  than  CB  and  IMM  in  the   three  levels  of  education.  Three  cases  are  worth  presenting.         First,  in  occupation  1431-Accounting  and  Related  Clerks  the  wage  gap  is   smaller  among  those  with  a  university  degree  (UD)  than  among  those  with   high  school  or  less.         Second,  in  three  occupations  (6474,  6453  and  1431)  the  NPR-IMM  wage- gap  for  those  with  college  degrees  or  trades  certificates  (CD-TC)  is  smaller   than  the  wage  gap  of  those  with  high  school  or  less.     Third,  in  the  remaining  five  occupations  the  wage  gap  among  those  with   post-secondary  education  (UD  or  CD-TC)  was  bigger  than  the  wage  gap  of   those  with  high  school  or  less.  

5.  NPRs  who  report   speaking  English  or   French  earn  lower   wages  than  IMM  who   also  report  speaking   English  or  French  in   each  occupation.   Additionally,  speaking   either  official  language   reduces  NPRs'  wage   gap  (compared  to  IMM).  

In  all  cases  NPRs  earned  less  than  CB  and  IMM.   5.1.  English:  Occupations  in  which  NPRs  are  expected  to  speak  English  (i.e.   6474-Babysitters,  nannies  and  Parents'  helpers)  were  not  examined,  since   speaking  English  has  no  effect  on  their  wages.  Other  occupations  were  worth   pursuing.  In  at  least  two  occupations  considered,  where  there  is  no   expectation  to  speak  English,  a  positive  effect  on  wages  among  NPRs  who   reported  speaking  English  was  found.  Their  wage  differences  were  smaller   than  those  of  the  whole  population  in  that  occupation.  This  is  a  valid  inference,   since  most  NPRs  in  those  occupations  come  from  non-English  speaking   countries.   5.2.  French:  Sample  size  did  not  allow  an  evaluation  of  effects  by  occupation   among  those  who  reported  speaking  French.  Nonetheless,  all  NPRs  who   reported  speaking  French  earned  13%  less  than  immigrants.  This  difference  is   smaller  than  that  for  the  whole  population  (27.3%  less  for  NPRs  compared  with   immigrants).  Therefore  speaking  French  seems  to  also  have  a  positive  effect   on  wages.   The  country  of  birth  influences  the  wages  of  low-skilled  temporary  foreign   workers.  NPRs  coming  from  Mexico  and  the  Caribbean  tend  to  work  in   occupations  in  agriculture  which  have  lower  wages.  NPRs  from  the  Philippines   mostly  work  in  caregiving  occupations,  which  are  among  the  occupations  with   the  low  wages  and  with  the  large  wage  differences  compared  to  CB  and  IMM.   NPRs  coming  from  the  UK  tend  to  work  in  occupations  with  higher  wages.   Having  citizenship  reduces  the  wage  gap  between  Mexican-born  low-skilled   workers  and  Canadian-born  low-skilled  workers.   Regression  

6.  NPRs  earn  lower   wages  than  CB  and   IMM  by  country  of  birth   in  the  occupations   analyzed  in  this  section.  

Hypotheses   1.  In  the  model  for  all   occupations,  controlling   for  age,  sex,   immigration  status,  

Findings   Being  a  NPR  has  a  large  negative  effect  (19%  less  wage).   Lacking  citizenship  (being  a  NPR)  had  a  significant  negative  effect  on  wage  in   eight  out  of  the  nine  occupations  with  individual  models.  Only  in  occupation   9462-Industrial  Butchers  and  Meat  Cutters,  Poultry  Preparers  and  Related

province  of  residence,   work  location   (rural/urban),  level  of   education,  ability  to   speak  English  or  French   and  place  of  birth,  being   a  NPR  has  a  significant   negative  impact  on   wages  compared  to   being  Canadian-born.   2.  In  each  occupational   level  model,  controlling   for  age,  sex,   immigration  status  and   province  of  residence,   work  location   (rural/urban),  level  of   education,  ability  to   speak  English  or  French   and  place  of  birth,  being   a  NPR  has  a  significant   negative  impact  on   wages  compared  to   being  Canadian-born.  

Workers,  did  being  a  NPR  have  no  statistically  significant  effect  on  wages.   Age  has  a  negligible  positive  effect  for  low-skilled  workers  in  Canada.   Low-skilled  female  workers  earn  lower  wages  than  low-skilled  male  workers.   According  to  the  regression  models,  low-skilled  females  working  in  low-skilled   occupations  earn  14%  less  wage  than  males.   4.1.  Province  of  Residence:  among  low-skilled  workers,  working  in  provinces   with  the  largest  economies  has  a  positive  effect  on  wages  compared  to   working  in  Quebec.  In  contrast,  working  in  smaller  provinces  has  a  negative   effect  compared  to  working  in  Quebec.   While  workers  in  Ontario  and  British  Columbia  earn  5.4%  and  5.9%  more  than   in  Quebec,  workers  in  Atlantic  Canada  and  the  Prairie  provinces  earn  13.4%   and  4.6%  less  than  in  Quebec.   4.2.  Location  of  Work  (Rural-Urban):  According  to  the  model,  working  in  rural   areas  represents  4.2%  less  than  working  in  urban  areas.   Having  a  postsecondary  degree  has  a  positive  effect  on  wages.  Compared  to   those  with  a  high  school  degree  or  less,  having  a  college  degree  or  a  trades   certificate  represents  5.8%  more  in  wages.  For  those  with  university  degrees   the  premium  rises  to  7.2%  on  hourly  wages  (see  Table  12).   Not  speaking  either  official  language  has  a  negative  effect  on  wage.  More   specifically,  not  speaking  either  English  or  French  represents  12.2%  less  in   wages  compared  to  those  who  report  speaking  either  official  language.   The  effect  of  place  of  birth  on  wages  among  low-skilled  workers  is  positive  if   the  workers  are  born  in  West,  North,  Central  or  Southern  Europe.  If  the   workers  are  born  anywhere  else  in  the  world  (with  statistically  significant   outcomes),  the  effect  is  negative.   Among  the  98  low-skilled  occupations  considered  in  this  analysis  (plus  one  for   reference),  36  have  a  wage  below  the  average  for  all  low-skilled  occupations   (34  of  which  are  statistically  significant).  In  contrast,  62  have  a  wage  above  the   average  (57  of  which  are  statistically  significant).
