THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ROOFING COOL COATINGS ON THE BUILDING ENERGY DEMAND IN A COLD CLIMATE
Master of Building Science, 2017 Tahmina Begum Building Science, Ryerson University

Abstract An average temperature increase of 2oC over the last 140 years in Toronto may not seem significant, but in reality heating demand for buildings will go down by impacting natural gas usage while cooling demand will go up by impacting electricity-usage. For preparedness against hot summer in cold climate, passive cooling needs to be adopted for building energy efficiency. In warm climate, cool roof technology proves effectiveness in reducing cooling energy demand of buildings but its use in cold climate is not much seen. Thus it is interesting to investigate the effectiveness of cool roofs in cold climate. This study investigates the properties of cool coatings available in North America, their performance on aging and energy saving benefits. The first phase of research includes selection of building, collection of information, field measurement of surface temperatures of the studied building and also lab testing of collected samples. The second phase includes energy modelling of the studied building with validation to understand their energy saving benefits. Finally the most effective cool coating for the studied building is recommended.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ROOFING COOL COATINGS ON THE BUILDING ENERGY DEMAND IN A COLD CLIMATE 1. Introduction

Global warming is an issue of concern today. According to Staff Background Report of Energy Efficiency Office, Business & Strategic Innovation, Facilities & Real Estate Division of the City of Toronto, a further 2oC increase in temperature is projected in the next 30 years alone. The number of days that Toronto experiences temperatures above 30oC is expected to grow from an average of 17 days per year in the period of 1961-1990 to 38 days per year by the 2050s. While a 2oC temperature change does not seem significant, the reality is heating demand for buildings will go down which will impact the use of natural gas while cooling demand for buildings will go up that will impact the use of electricity (Toronto's Sustainable Energy Plan, 2007).

As mentioned in the recent literature, in 2005, residents of Ontario suffered a hot summer with long stretches of high temperatures and humidity; in particular, Toronto sustained 41 days with temperatures above 30OC, and 25 nights with minimum temperature above 20OC (Hengeveld et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2016). In Toronto, days with temperatures above 30OC are expected to increase from an average of 13 nights per year in the 1970s to 65 by the end of this century (Hengeveld et al., 2016; Tam et al., 2015; Berardi et al., 2016). Due to the expected warming of up to 9OC by the 2080s in the Arctic and the southern and central Prairies (Natural Resource Canada, 2004) the number of days with average temperatures above 30OC is likely to increase in cities across Canada, and particularly in those located in the Windsor-Quebec corridor (such as Toronto) and portions of British Columbia (Wang et al., 2016). Every 0.6OC increase in air temperature resulted by the UHI effect can add 1.5% to 2% to the peak demand for cooling (Akbari, 2005; Berardi et al., 2016). The policies actually adopted in developed countries are insufficient to guarantee a significant reduction in their building energy consumption in the years to come. In the current scenario, at least a doubling of the global energy demand in buildings compared to today's levels will occur by 2050 (Berardi, 2017). To avoid this forecast, cost-effective best practices and technologies as well as behavioral and lifestyle changes need to be diffused and accepted globally (Berardi, 2017). For the preparedness against hot summer in cold climate, passive cooling options need to be adopted for energy efficiency and Urban Heat Island (UHI) mitigation. In warm climate, the 1

use of cool coating on roof has proven to be a very effective solution in reducing cooling energy demand of the buildings and mitigating UHI effect. However, the use of cool coating on roof in cold climate is not much seen. The following chapter presents literature review regarding cool roof coating contribution in energy performance.

This study analyses some selected cool coatings available in North American market, tests their properties, behaviour while new and aged in the laboratory environment and also compares energy use intensity for different cool coatings as well as surface temperature profiles, and finally recommends whether it is worthwhile to use any cool coating for the studied building regarding its cooling energy efficiency.

As a case study, a storage building in Ajax of Greater Toronto area, Ontario was selected for assessing the benefits of using highly reflective coating to reduce cooling energy use. The building complex consists of two parts; one part has non-heated and non-conditioned selfstorage facilities and the other part has an air-conditioned office cum residence for the site manager. The storage part has white painted low metal roof to have lower temperature inside during hot weather, but the office building has flat roof construction finished with roofing membrane (Appendix B) and requires 24 hours cooling during summer. Therefore, it was interesting to analyse this part of building for the reduction of cooling energy. The study is interesting and new in a sense that the properties of some cool coating were tested in the laboratory and those tested properties were used in energy simulation to analyse the cooling energy use intensity for a studied building in cold climate and also Toronto specific climate need is different than most of the studies done in the temperate and Mediterranean climate. The energy bill collected for validation of energy model stands for the whole complex including the office and storage structures.

2. Literature Review

A considerable amount of current literature review on cool roof technology and related publications regarding urban heat island has been conducted to get the understanding of the topic that helped to form the research questions for this study. 2.1 Summary of Current Studies Petrie et al. (2004) documented how the CoolCalcPeak version was added to include estimates of savings in demand charges that large facilities often incur for electricity. Their study obtained differences in peak deck heat fluxes with solar radiation control and without it over the cooling season for varying location (as characterized by average solar insolation), R-value of the lowslope roof, and solar reflectance and infrared emittance of the roof surface. Peak solar insolation is relatively constant over the United States. Thus, lower demand charges save about the same amount of annual operating costs for a particular set of circumstances in all U.S. climates that have significant cooling requirements. The Cool CalcPeak version of the DOE Cool Roof Calculator was exercised with Miami, Knoxville and Minneapolis climatic data to estimate the effect of solar radiation control on annual energy costs for cooling only, annual energy costs for cooling and heating and annual demand costs for various roof surfaces and insulation R-values. The energy costs show the expected heating penalty for a white (R70E90) surface in all climates. It makes this surface show no energy cost savings for heating and cooling in Minneapolis. Hoff, JL. (2005) mentioned although effective and accurate means of calculating the economic value of reflective roofing are now easily available, some roofing industry leaders have expressed concern that the benefits of reflective roofing may be misunderstood by many building owners and designers. The first area of possible misunderstanding involves the magnitude of savings offered by reflective roofs and the second involves the application of generalized reflective roofing principles in areas of the country where solar radiation is not a significant climate factor. Misunderstandings due to the lack of effective caveats in programs such as Energy Star and LEED may be further distorted by the marketing messages of commercial organizations with a vested interest in selling reflective roofs. Although this assertion may have some validity in a warm and sunny climate, it is unlikely that a reflective metal roof will provide any more energy savings than any other roof system in a cool and cloudy 3

environment, such as Oregon, or a cold climate region, such as Minnesota. The author (Hoff, JL., 2005) developed two graphic representations of the geographic variation in reflective roofing energy savings. The first is a simple tabular representation of the energy data for over 40 cities in the United States that allows direct comparison of the key input variables and calculated outputs for each location. The second graphic representation is a map of the United States dividing the cities into common geographic bands representing different increments of energy savings. Akbari et al. (2005) summarized laboratory measurements of the solar spectral reflectance of un-weathered, weathered, and cleaned samples collected from single-ply roofing membranes at various sites across the United States. Results indicate that although the majority of samples after being washed with detergent could be brought to within 90% of their un-weathered reflectivity, in some instances an algaecide was required to restore this level of reflectivity. They summarized that a simple cleaning with water and cloth allowed the samples to regain a substantial part of their original reflectivity. The roofing materials evaluated in their study did not lose any of its inherent reflectivity with aging, but rather, in-situ reflectivity diminishment occurred because of atmospheric deposition (primarily by soot) and other "local" environmental factors. Synnefa et al. (2007) estimated the impact of using cool roof coatings on the cooling and heating loads and on the indoor thermal comfort conditions of residential buildings for various climatic conditions. They studied 27 locations around the world and selected 5 locations for representative results. Those selected locations are Abu Dhabi where there is no heating load, New Delhi where cooling load is significantly more important than heating load, Casablanca where heating load is almost half compared to cooling load, Damascus where cooling and heating loads are almost equal and Tokyo that is heating load dominated. In an effort to estimate also the heating penalty from increasing solar reflectance, they calculated the cooling loads as well. Figure-2.1.1 depicts the changes in cooling and heating loads resulting from an increase in roof solar reflectance of 0.65. It shows that the potential savings are greater in cooling dominated climates. The decrease in cooling loads always exceeded the increase in heating load (except for the case of Mexico City). They concluded that increasing solar reflectance of a roof is typically more beneficial in hot climates where cooling load dominates most of the year. 4

Figure-2.1.1: Climate effect on cooling & heating load changes for a change in roof solar reflectance of 0.65 (Synnefa et al. 2007)

They found that an increase in roof solar reflectance by 0.65 resulting from the application of a cool coating reduces cooling loads by 8Â­48 kWh/m2, the hours of discomfort by 9Â­100% and the maximum temperature by 1.2Â­3.7 oC, depending on the climatic conditions. They also demonstrated that the heating penalty (0.2Â­17 kWh/m2 year) is less important compared to the cooling load reduction (9Â­48 kWh/m2 year) for the climates studied and that increasing the reflectance of the roof would be more beneficial regarding the reduction of energy savings and energy costs for lower or no roof insulation levels. Santamouris et al. (2011) presented the actual state of the art on the development and the assessment of cool materials (i.e. materials with high solar reflectance and infrared emittance) for buildings and urban structures. The research in this field is roughly divided in four phases and includes the development and assessment of: (a) highly reflective and emissive light coloured materials, (b) cool coloured materials, i.e. coloured materials with increased near infrared and thus overall solar reflectance compared to similarly coloured conventional ones, (c) phase change materials and (d) dynamic cool materials. The study concluded that the development of materials with dynamic optical characteristics seems to be a very efficient solution to increased heating load problem in winter, that is, in balancing the heating penalty. 5

Figure-2.1.2: The basic principles of cool materials (Santamouris et al. 2011)

If the cool surface is on the building envelope, this would result in decreasing the heat penetrating into the building. Moreover, for a surface in the urban environment, this would contribute to decrease the temperature of the ambient air, as the heat convection intensity from a cooler surface is lower (Figure-2.1.2).

Figure-2.1.3: The spectral reflectance of a conventional and a cool black coating (Santamouris et al. 2011)

A surface that absorbs in the visible part of the solar spectrum in order to have a specific colour, but strongly reflects in the near infrared part, would have an overall solar reflectance that is higher compared to a similarly coloured surface (same visible reflectance) that absorbs also in the near infrared part (Figure-2.1.3). 6

Figure-2.1.4: The spectral reflectance of conventional (asphalt and aged asphalt) and cool (thin layer green and off-white) asphalt. (Santamouris et al. 2011)

The spectral reflectance of conventional black asphalt (new with SR = 0.06 and aged with SR = 0.15) and of cool coloured thin layer asphalt (green with SR = 0.27 and off-white with SR = 0.55) can be applied over existing asphalt paving and increase their solar reflectance (Figure-2.1.4) for reducing urban heat island effect and improving urban thermal comfort condition. So Santamouris et al. (2011) described all major aspects related to each cool roof technology and reported the benefits and impacts of these materials at building, city and global scale. Later after two years, Kolokotsa et al. (2013) presented similar benefits of cool materials for the built environment by addressing multiple aspects of the materials and their effects. They covered physical characterization of cool materials, their modelling, rating, testing, energy and environmental impacts, economics and marketing, and related policy aspects. The study by Bozonnet et al. (2011) investigated the potential benefit of cool roof technology in a temperate climate by focusing on a case study in Poitiers (France) on a cool roof for a low-rise public housing, without any active cooling system. The study showed that the cool roof decreases the mean outside surface temperature by more than 10OC, with low differences for lower temperatures, but a strong impact on the highest temperatures. The mean effect of the cool coating on the indoor operative temperature appears to be very low for their studied building, but the difference for the highest temperatures is not negligible. This is mainly due to the strong insulation consistent with building standards in France for all new buildings. Thus, the indoor temperature differences are very clear for the non-insulated building (Figure-2.1.5). 7

Non-insulated roof

Romeo et al. (2013) addressed positive effects of a cool roof application in reducing cooling demand and increasing thermal comfort in Mediterranean climate. Their experiment was carried out in two phases (monitoring and simulation) in an office/laboratory building belonging to a school campus in Trapani, on the west coast of Sicily. 8

Figure-2.1.6: Outdoor air and roof surface temperature profiles of the non-treated surface and cool roofs from August 1st to 20th (Romeo et al. 2013)

Figure-2.1.6 from their study shows that the difference between the original roof and the air temperature reached 20OC in nine days, while the difference between the cool roof and the air was never higher than 5OC. Romeo et al. (2013) also found that high ratio of the roof surface to the building volume is suitable to achieve significant results. The impact of cool roofs will decrease with the reduction of the above ratio and lower relative savings have to be expected for multi-storey buildings, while the specific savings, typically expressed for roof square meters, will not significantly change. Pisello et al. (2013) investigated coupled passiveÂ­active effect produced by cool roofs on an industrial-office building in Rome, where active effect has the capability to decrease suction air temperature of roof top heat pump external units. While decreasing the suction air temperature, it also decreases the temperature lift between source (intake air) and output (supply air) of the heat pump in cooling mode. Thus the energy efficiency of the heat pump increases in summer.

Figure-2.1.7: Temperature probes of the suction air in (a) before cool roof application and (b) after cool roof application (Pisello et al. 2013)

Their experiment was conducted before and after application of cool roof (Figure-2.1.7). The optical-thermal performance of the chosen cool roof coating was characterized by in-field albedo measurement through albedo meter facility. The albedo before cool roof application was 0.07 (bitumen covering) while the albedo after cool roof application was 0.75. 9

Scenario A Â­ After cool roof application Scenario B Â­ Before cool roof application

Figure-2.1.8: External roof surface temperature versus outdoor temperature before and after cool roof application (Pisello et al. 2013)

Figure-2.1.8 taken from their study reports the daily profiles of measured suction temperatures, Ts,B (measured) and Ts,A (measured), and measured outdoor temperatures, To,B (measured) and To,A (measured) , for scenarios B (Before cool roof application) and A (After cool roof application), respectively. Therefore, the cool roof "active" effect consists of the reduction of the amplitude difference between Ts and To by 1.2Â°C, i.e. from 0.7Â°C to- 0.5Â°C.

Cool roof's passive cooling effect of decreasing suction air temperature (Figure-2.1.8) actively contribute to decrease the temperature lift between source air and output air of the heat pump in cooling mode, thus increases energy efficiency of the heat pump. The overall cool roof benefit corresponds to 34% of energy saving during the day and to 47% during the night. Pisello et al. (2014) quantified both the summer benefits and the winter penalties of an innovative "cool roof" solution (brick tiles that have been produced through the same industrial process of the other existing tiles and the actual colour is basically light beige-white) with the prototype clay tile to improve thermal condition in residential buildings in temperate climate (Figure-2.1.9). 10

Figure-2.1.9: Scenario with traditional clay tile and reflective brick tiles. (Pisello et al. 2013)

During summer, the high reflection tiles are able to decrease the average external roof surface temperature by more than 10oC and the indoor operative temperature by more than 3oC and during winter, the average external surface temperature is lower with high reflection tiles by about 1 Â°C (Figure-2.1.10). Their study showed that cool roof strategies constitute effective solutions for optimizing indoor thermal performance in summer while winter penalties of the same configurations are very much lower than summer benefits (Fig-2.1.11), in terms of indoor thermal behaviour of the free running attic, also in climate contexts with high seasonal thermal variability.

Figure-2.1.11: Indoor environment overheating with respect to the global radiation of the location in (a) July and (b) January (Pisello et al. 2014)

The study shows how this kind of roof element optimization in terms of reflectance and emissivity could decrease the roof external temperature and to reduce also the attic overheating when the sloped roof is directly impacted by sunbeams. Hosseini et al. (2014) quantified the heating energy penalties of a cool roof accounting for the effect of roof snow. The researchers simulated the annual heating and cooling energy use in conventional and cool roof buildings in four cities (Anchorage, Milwaukee, Montreal & Toronto) in cold climates.

In cold climates, the sun angle is low, days are short, the sky is cloudy, and most the heating occurs early in the morning or in the evening hours during winter when the solar intensity is low. In addition, the roof may be covered with snow for most of the heating season. Snow on the roof provides an additional layer of insulation and increases the solar reflectance of the roof. All these lead to a lower (than what is commonly thought) wintertime heating penalties for cool roofs (Figure-2.1.12). Thus it is found that the penalties for cool roofs in cold climates are very small, if any. Cool roofs also save peak demand electricity use during summer (Figure-2.1.13) and potentially lead to downsizing of the HVAC equipment. 12

Antonaia et al. (2016) conducted the experimental investigation of the optical and thermal properties of several types of "cool paints" in terms of solar reflectance, thermal-emittance, and durability in Mediterranean climate. The main steps of the research were selection of new products for cool roof; development of the samples and in-lab experimental analysis for the characterization of thermal-optical properties; numerical analysis for the evaluation of energy saving and reduction of polluting emission, with indicative economic feasibility study. The result showed only the white acrylic paint has good values for spectral reflectance (77 - 80%) and thermal emissivity (92%) that are comparable with commercial products. Globally summer benefits are very satisfying but the annual energy saving varies between 0.3-3.0%. Their research differs with the other studies reviewed in this chapter because they evaluated the potentialities of commercial products (paints of automotive sector) not specialized for cool roofing application. Sharma et al. (2016) examined the efficacy of green and cool roofs as potential UHI mitigation strategies to make cities more resilient against UHI. Their study discussed green/cool roof mechanisms, evaluated UCM's performance with observations and assessed impacts of UHI on different urban land-use, regional lake breeze circulations, and boundary layer effects. Even though the results of the modelling system are site-specific and location dependent, they, especially qualitative impacts on the convective boundary layer, can be interpolated to other urban areas which strive for similar sustainability goals as Chicago.

Figure-2.1.14. Angular distribution of reflected radiation: RR sample (Source: Castellani et al. (2016)

According to Castellani et al. (2016), retro-reflective (RR) materials, due to their ability to reflect most of the incident energy towards the same incoming direction, represent an opportunity to reduce UHI phenomenon. The optical properties of retro-reflective materials 15

suggest that they could be effectively applied as coatings in order to reflect the solar radiation beyond the urban canyon. Retro-reflective samples show the preponderance of retro-reflected radiation for 10Â° and 30Â°. At 60Â° retro -reflection property is maintained, although symmetrically-reflected radiation percentage is higher than the retro-reflected one. At 70Â°, retro-reflection is completely lost and there is only specular reflection (Fig-2.1.14).

Figure-2.1.15 from their study depicts the global reflected radiation profiles of Beige diffusive and Retro-reflective tested sample over the wavelength in a reproduced urban canyon in laboratory.

Figure-2.1.15. Reflectance spectrum: Beige diffusive and Retro-reflective(Source: Castellani et al. (2016)

Morini et al. (2017) showed that for high angles of incidence (greater than 60) the retroreflectivity is lost by the retro-reflective samples. Their experimental characterization showed that retro-reflective materials could be effectively applied as coatings on building envelope, in order to reduce the energy trapped within the urban canopy and thus to reduce the UHI effect.

Figure-2.1.16: Glass beads for retro-reflective property (Source: Morini et al. (2017)

Their study is connected to the international research activities on retro-reflective materials and aims at giving a contribution on the development of retro-reflective coatings suitable for building applications (Figure-2.1.16). 16

The paper of Morini et al. (2017) aims at investigating the relationship between the global (direct and diffuse) solar radiation and its reflection from an experimental model resembling urban districts with different geometries and different materials. They found that the increase of the average daily urban albedo and thus the reduction of urban heat island formation and the improvement of the urban comfort can be obtained by the use of retro-reflective envelopes. Rossi et al. (2014) dealt with an experimental and analytical study for the assessment of the angular reflectance of retro-reflective films. The experimental campaign and a novel analytical model showed that retro-reflective materials could be effectively applied as coatings on urban paving and building envelope, in order to reflect the solar radiation beyond the urban canyon and the urban canopy in general. The specific research target of Rossi et al. (2015) was to investigate the benefit that can be obtained by the application of new retro-reflective cool materials on building envelopes in urban canyons. The results suggest that retro-reflective materials have a cooling potential as coatings in urban canyons, and can thus improve urban climate conditions during summer.

Figure-2.1.17: Samples' angular distribution of reflected radiation (Source: Rossi et al. (2015)

17

The paper of Rossi et al. (2015) aimed at the assessment of angular reflectance of retroreflective films for several inclination angles of solar radiation. The experimental characterization and energy evaluations showed that retro-reflective materials could be effectively applied as coatings on urban paving and building envelope, in order to reduce the circulating energy into the canyon. Rossi et al. (2016) studied the positive effect of retro-reflective pavements on the energy kept inside the canyon on a physical model that represents an urban canyon layout. The performance of retro-reflective materials was compared to that of white and beige traditional cool diffusive materials in the spectral range of the incoming radiation from 360 to 1100 nm (Figure-2.1.21). The results show a cooling potential of the retro-reflective material with respect to the white and the beige diffusive materials, with a maximum albedo increase of 4.6%. The paper of Zinzi et al. (2017) investigates the impact of the urban environment on the energy and thermal response of residential buildings, considering the case of the city of Rome, Italy. Ambient air temperature and relative humidity were continuously measured in four neighbourhoods in 2015 and 2016. The monitored neighbourhoods were characterized by location in the urban area; construction materials for buildings and pavements; geometry of the urban texture. Data were also measured by a non-urban station, used as undisturbed reference. The climatic data were then used to calculate the thermal response of a typical Italian residential building, ideally located in the monitored areas of the city. Two envelope configurations were taken into account: with and without thermal insulation. Heat island intensities up to 8 Â°C were detected, with maximum monthly averages equal to 2 Â°C. The urban heat island increases the building cooling energy needs by 12% in the peripheral neighbourhood and by up to 46% in the city centre, respect to the undisturbed zone. 2.2 Analysis for Future Research Area

From the literature review, an overall understanding on the contribution of cool roof technology on energy performance has been gained. Petrie et al. (2004) documented how the CoolCalcPeak version was added to include estimates of savings in demand charges that large facilities often incur for electricity. Hoff, J. L. (2005) developed two graphic representations of the geographic variation in reflective roofing energy savings. The study from Synnefa et al. (2007) estimated the impact of using cool roof coatings on the cooling and heating loads and on 18

the indoor thermal comfort conditions of residential buildings for various climatic conditions. Santamouris et al. (2011) reported all major aspects related to each cool technology such as benefits and impacts at building, city and global scale. The wide use of such materials can significantly contribute to the mitigation of the heat island effect and the improvement of urban environmental quality. A further research can be initiated regarding cooling energy efficiency by the use of cool coating on exterior walls of buildings. Kolokotsa et al. (2013) elaborated the same concepts like Santamouris et al. (2011) with some other related aspects later, which gave a detail understanding on the technology. Akbari et al. (2005) summarized the majority of collected roofing samples could be brought to within 90% of their un-weathered reflectivity after being washed with detergent, in some instances an algaecide was required to restore this level of reflectivity. A further study can be conducted regarding aging of cool roof technology using different types of substrates.

Bozonnet et al. (2011) showed that the cool roof decreases the mean outside surface temperature, with low differences for lower temperatures, but a strong impact on the highest temperatures. Thus, direct impact on high temperatures depending on the building use and the ceiling insulation highlights the interest of the cool coating on the summer comfort. The study by Romeo et al. (2013) concluded that the impact of cool roofs will decrease with the reduction of `roof surface to building volume ratio' and lower relative savings have to be expected for multistorey buildings, that means, cool roof impacts on the immediate lower storey under the roof. A future work can be done to understand the reduction of cooling energy for the lower stories of multi-storey buildings while using the cool coating on vertical facades of the envelope.

The result from the study of Pisello et al. (2013) gave an understanding that the cool roof is able to decrease the suction air temperature of the heat pumps external units, when these units are located over the roof and thus increases the efficiency of the heat pump. A further study can be done regarding increasing efficiency of heat pump by comparing different type of cool roof technology. The study of Pisello et al. (2014) showed that cool roof strategies constitute effective solutions for optimizing indoor thermal performance in summer while winter penalties of the same configurations are very much lower than summer benefits, in terms of indoor thermal behaviour of the free running attic, also in climate contexts with high seasonal thermal variability. Hosseini 19

et al. (2014) found that the penalties for cool roofs in cold climates are very small, if any. Cool roofs save peak demand electricity use during summer and potentially lead to downsizing of the HVAC equipment; this is the one of the cold climate based study among the literature reviewed for this report, but it emphasized on heating penalty. Antonaia et al. (2016) evaluated the potentialities of commercial products not specialized for cool roofing application in Mediterranean climate. Sharma et al. (2016) examined the efficacy of green and cool roofs as potential UHI mitigation strategies to make cities more resilient against UHI. According to Morini et al. (2017) retro-reflective (RR) materials have been proposed as innovative cool materials. RR materials are characterized by optical properties that reflect most of the incident solar energy backward towards the same incident direction. A number of studies contributed to understand the application of retro-reflective materials on building envelopes in decreasing circulating energy in urban canyons to reduce of UHI by (Rossi et al. (2014), Rossi et al. (2015), Rossi et al. (2016) and Morini et al. (2017). Regarding retro-reflective materials, Castellani et al. (2016) and Morini et al. (2017) showed in addition that for higher angles of incidence (greater than 60) of solar radiation the retro-reflectivity is lost by the retro-reflective samples. Researchers at present are already actively studying for using retro-reflective paint as cool coating on reducing heat island effect in urban canyons, thus further studies can be done how the use of retro-reflective paints effect on cooling energy of buildings.

Zinzi, M. et al. (2017) investigated the impact of the urban environment on the energy and thermal response of residential buildings, considering the case of a Mediterranean city. Another future study can be done for residential buildings with slope roof in cold climate with hot summer.

3. The Research 3.1 Conceptual Framework & Research Questions

From literature review, it has been found that most of the studies regarding cool roof technology for energy performance have been conducted in temperate and Mediterranean climate. And considerably few works regarding this technology have focused on energy savings in cold climate especially on cooling energy in cold climate.

According to ASHRAE 90.1-2007, Toronto is in climate zone 6. Heating degree-days (HDDs) based on 18OC in zone 6 is 4000. Here it is useful to understand the definition of cold climate with hot humid summer. According to ASHRAE 90.1-2010, degree-day is the difference in temperature between the outdoor mean temperature over a 24-hour period and a given base temperature. For the purposes of determining building envelope requirements, the classifications are defined as follows: cooling degree-day(CDDs) base 50Â°F: for anyone day, when the mean temperature is more than 50Â°F or 10OC, there are as many degree-days as degrees Fahrenheit temperature difference between the mean temperature for the day and 50Â°F. Annual CDDs are the sum of the degree-days over a calendar year. And annual HDDs are the sum of the degree-days over a calendar year. As mentioned by John Straube, 2012, many parts of eastern cold climate regions have similar cooling demand as locations in the southern US, such as, Toronto has significant cooling and humidity control challenges. Hence, high performance of buildings in these climates needs to manage hot and humid weather as well as cold dry weather.

Considering the climate of Toronto, that experiences high temperature during summer and is getting higher every year, it is the right time to think about the preparedness against hot summer with an aim of reducing cooling energy in buildings. In warm climate cool roof technology has been proven to be a very effective solution, therefore, it was interesting to investigate the effectiveness of roofing cool coatings on the building energy demand in a cold climate with hot summer like Toronto. As discussed in Chapter 1, this study is new because the properties of some cool coating were tested in the laboratory and those tested properties were used in energy simulation to analyse the cooling energy use intensity for a studied building in cold climate and also Toronto specific climate need is different than most of the studies done in the temperate and Mediterranean climate. 21

The study is based on an experimental research and has three research questions as follows: Â· Â· Â· What are the reflectance values of some cool coatings available in North America? Do the selected cool coatings loose some reflectance value due to aging? What is the energy saving benefits of the selected cool coatings in cold climate?

3.2. Methodology/Research Design

The methodology of this research has been divided into two main phases and has been elaborated as follows: First Phase: The first phase of the research consists of the experiment of cool coatings in the laboratory and the steps are as follows: 1. Identify and collect five cool or high reflective coatings available in North American market. 2. Understand the properties (specifically reflectance) of cool coatings from manufacturers' technical data sheets. 3. Prepare substrates for experiment by cutting ceramic tiles into pieces of 6 cm X 10 cm size using appropriate tools (eg. glass cutter and/or tile cutter) to apply coating for test (Figure-3.2.1 & 3.2.2).

Figure-3.2.1: Glass cutter

Figure-3.2.2: Tile cutter

22

4. Apply the selected cool coatings on substrates to get five sample sets (Figure-3.2.3), one of the sets kept for aging test.

Figure-3.2.3: Cool coating sample sets

5. Measure and record the reflectance values of the cool coatings using spectrophotometer in the laboratory (Figure-3.2.4).

Figure-3.2.4: Spectrophotometer

6. Keep one set of samples in the Aging machine (Accelerated Weathering Tester-QUV) in the laboratory to let them age for one month (1 month = 20 years time) (Figure-3.2.5). 23

Figure-3.2.5: Aging Machine

7. Measure the reflectance values of the aged samples in the laboratory using spectrophotometer. 8. Compare the recorded reflection data to find the changes on reflective behaviour between the newly coated and aged samples. Second Phase: The second phase of the research includes energy modelling for the energy saving value of the selected cool coatings in cold climate using Design Builder software that uses Energy Plus as its simulation engine. The methodology for this phase is as follows: 1. Selection of a building that uses air-conditioning during summer and may require reduction of cooling energy usage. 2. Collect detail drawings of the selected building complex and the electricity bills during summer time. 3. Measure indoor air temperature, roof surface temperature and ceiling surface temperature by using data logger (MadgeTech Oct Temp 8-channel thermo-couple temperature recorder with USB data-logger interface ICF 200) for the selected building at least for 20 days during summer to understand the temperature profile on the location. 24

Figure-3.2.6: MadgeTech Oct Temp 8-channel thermo couple temperature recorder

4. Model the building complex in Design Builder using the properties of materials mentioned in the collected drawings. 5. Run simulation using the local weather station file (Toronto Pearson International Airport) and compare the measured and simulated temperatures on roof and ceiling surface to understand the variation in temperature profile of that location. 6. Calibration/Validation of model by comparing collected and simulated energy use intensity to check reasonable accuracy (Â±) of the experiment. 7. Further simulation by applying five selected cool coatings with their properties, determined from lab test, on the roof surface of the studied portion of the building to understand the variation of energy use intensity. 8. Compare the results of energy use intensity for five different selected cool coatings from the simulation. 9. Recommend the effective cool coating, if worthwhile, for cooling energy reduction for the studied part of the complex. 25

3.3 Limitations Â· It would be effective to validate the energy model by using the on-site temperature of roof, ceiling and indoor temperature of the air-conditioned part of the complex. But it was not possible as there is no existing roof hatch in this part of the building. Furthermore, the workplace privacy did not allow the long-time measurement process to take place. Thus, the measurement was taken on the non-air-conditioned part of the complex, which is the storage area, and has been used to have an idea about variation of inside and outside surface temperature profile of that location by comparing with simulation data. Â· A variety of cool coating samples are not available in Canada. The reason may be the use of cool roof is not common in cold climate. Therefore, two of the coatings out of five samples have been collected from USA and used for the experiment. Â· Due to the unavailability and workability of the latest weather data (epw file of 2016), the 2002 weather file built in Design Builder software has been used for the simulation which definitely gives a different picture rather than it would have given in the real situation; but the result was close and did not deviate more than 20 to 30% for this study. Â· The electricity bill collected is for the whole complex. But the energy simulation model was done for the office cum residence part of the complex only (as shown in Figure4.3.1). And Building-8 has been simulated for comparing on-site temperature measurement. Thus to compare energy use between collected and simulated data, the electricity usage for non-air-conditioned storage parts (Building 1 to 7) has been calculated manually following Building-8 electricity usage. Â· One of the samples, Albedo 100 permanent silver reflective spray, is not manufactured for use on the roof and does not mention any reflectance value anywhere. But it has been selected for being a reflective coating applicable to any surface and also available in Canada; thus the average value found in the laboratory test for this has been used for energy simulation. 3.4 Possible Outcome and Motivation The possible outcome of the study may help the designers in decision making for selecting cool roof material for buildings and houses in cold climate, either for retrofit or new construction purposes. The study may help the manufacturers regarding the introduction of innovative cool roof products for cold climate further. The availability and use of different cool roof product on roof will help to improve indoor comfort of building and reduce cooling energy demand and thus will contribute to cool the globe by mitigating urban heat island in a passive way. 26

4.3 Analysis of Cool Coatings by Energy Simulation The properties of cool coating samples determined from laboratory test were assigned in the energy model to analyse energy use intensity for their properties while those samples are newly coated. 4.3.1 Selection of Study building

Sentinnel Storage, located at 75 Harwood Avenue North, Ajax, Ontario (Figure-4.3.1) was selected for the study. The complex consists of eight non-heated and non-conditioned storage buildings (Building 1 to 8) with a small heated and air-conditioned office cum residence for site manager. The air-conditioned part of the complex has typical flat roof construction with roofing 31

membrane with insulation R-20, while the storage parts have white painted metal roofs with insulation (R-20 for Building 8 and R-7 for Building 1-7). The office cum residence has an area of 125.20 m2 which has been considered for this study. The studied part shares a common wall with the largest storage building (Building 8) and the rest of the storage buildings are all isolated as shown in Figure-4.3.2.

4.3.2 Onsite Measurement

The measurement process was undertaken in one of the storage units as shown in Figure-4.3.2. Indoor air temperature, roof surface temperature and ceiling surface temperature were measured by using data logger (MadgeTech Oct Temp 8-channel thermo-couple temperature recorder with USB data logger interface ICF 200) during summer 2016 starting from 8th July to 28th July for 20 days to understand the temperature profile on the location. Two thermocouples were attached on the outside roof surface and inside ceiling surface respectively by connecting with two of the eight channels of the device to get the readings in every 5 minutes interval. 4.3.3 Modelling the Study Building

The energy model was created for simulation of the air-conditioned part of the complex and each of the selected cool coatings was applied using their properties from lab test to get the results. Additionally Building-8 was also modelled for comparing the simulated roof and ceiling surface temperature with the real scenario from on-site temperature measurement so that an idea about variation of temperature profile can be found.

34

4.3.4 Understanding Surface Temperature from Model & On-site Measurement

From on-site measurement of the temperature of outside surface (roof), inside surface and outside dry-bulb of the storage part of the complex on July 2016, it has been observed that ceiling surface temperature is always 10 to 15OC lower than the roof surface temperature (Figure 4.3.3). The reason may be for the use of white painted roof over the storage part of the complex.

From energy modelling of the storage part of the complex where the onsite measurement was taken, the temperature of outside surface (roof), inside surface and outside dry-bulb of the storage part of the complex on July 2002 were studied (Figure 4.3.4); it has been observed that ceiling surface temperature is also always much lower than the roof surface temperature. Thus an understanding has been gathered from the comparison of on-site observation and modelling result of similar behaviour of having lower temperature on inside ceiling surface than roof surface while the roof of existing storage is of white pre-finished metal on roof purlins by preengineered building manufacturer. 36

4.3.5 Validation of Model

The electricity bills from three billing periods during summer were collected for the complex (see Appendix). The billing periods are 15th May to 15th June, 15th June to 15th July and 15th July to 15th August in 2016. The bill includes the total electricity usage for the complex. To match total electricity use (kWh) from collected utility bill (by Veridian) with total electricity use (kWh) from the model, electricity usage of the total complex was calculated. The office and residence part (Studied portion) as well as Building-8 (Attached storage part) was taken from energy simulation but rest of the storage parts (Building 1 to 7) was manually calculated following the electricity usage of Building-8. Then total electricity usage from the model was found by addition. 37

Analysing energy use intensity per m2 from Figure 4.3.11 to 4.3.18, it has been revealed that all the cool coating samples depending on their own reflectance values possess the ability to reduce cooling energy usage compared to existing roof having bitumen roofing membrane. All the eight figures mentioned above show that existing roof has the highest usage of cooling energy per unit area. Sample # 4, LANCO Ultra-Siliconizer, which has the highest reflectance value of 80% results in the lowest energy usage and saves 7.43% of cooling energy annually and 6.39% for three billing period compared to the existing roofing membrane. Sample#5 Albedo 100 has the lowest reflectance and highest energy usage among the tested coatings. Thus higher the reflectance value, lower the energy use.

5. Surface Temperature Analysis from Simulation

From model, the surface temperature of roof (exterior surface) and ceiling (inside surface) of the studied part have been analysed considering conditioned and non-conditioned option for June 21-22, July 21-22 and August 21-22. As the temperature is the highest around July 21; thus taking the day one month before and one month after from July 21 has been considered as representative of summer for energy simulation. The conditioned option has been simulated with mechanical ventilation on, cooling on and natural ventilation off. The non-conditioned option uses both, one with mechanical ventilation on and the other with natural ventilation on. The nonconditioned mechanical ventilation option has been simulated with mechanical ventilation on, cooling off and natural ventilation off. The non-conditioned natural ventilation option has been simulated with mechanical ventilation off, cooling off and natural ventilation on. 5.1 Surface Temperature Analysis for June 21 & 22

The graphs in Figure 5.1.1, 5.1.2 and 5.1.3 show that the ceiling and roof surface temperature of the studied part of building starting from June 21 at 00.01 hours midnight to June 22 at 23:59 hours for three options (conditioned, non-conditioned with mechanical ventilation and nonconditioned with natural ventilation). Outside dry-bulb temperature is around 18 and 23 in peak time. The existing bitumen roof surface reaches at 47 and 75OC at peak times. All coating samples except Sample#5 Albedo 100 (as it has lower reflectance 25%) show very low temperature on outside surface or roof than the existing bitumen roof with 25 to 55OC difference for all options,. Inside surface or ceiling temperature does not show notable reduction for conditioned option. Considering non-conditioned options, inside surface or ceiling temperature gets little higher than that of conditioned option for both cases, mechanical and natural ventilation. But the total effect of cool coating combined with roof and ceiling surface temperature reduces the cooling energy as found from simulation result in Chapter 4.

Similarly the graphs in Figure 5.3.1, 5.3.2 and 5.3.3 show that the ceiling and roof surface temperature of the studied part of building starting from August 21 at 00.01 hours midnight to August 22 at 23:59 hours for three options (conditioned, non-conditioned with mechanical ventilation and non-conditioned with natural ventilation).

Unlike June and July, inside surface or ceiling temperature does not show notable reduction for conditioned option. Non-conditioned option with mechanical ventilation shows 8 to 10OC higher inside surface or ceiling temperature than that of conditioned option whereas non-conditioned option with natural ventilation shows 4 to 5OC higher ceiling temperature than that of conditioned option.

5.4 Findings from Surface Temperature Analysis

The result from on-site measurement showed higher outside or roof surface temperature than that of inside or ceiling. But the energy simulation result gives opposite picture by showing higher inside or ceiling surface temperature than that of outside or roof surface temperature. The reason may be the roof and wall assemblies and roofing technology as well as the function of the space are different for two areas. As mentioned in the limitation, on-site measurement and energy simulation could not be done for the same location. Though the roof and ceiling surface temperature in the storage and office part show different behaviour, regardless the findings are clear about the reduction of cooling energy demand with the cool coatings as found in the section 4.3.9.

6. Recommendation & Conclusion

The reflectance properties of the selected cool coatings have been studied from manufacturer's technical data sheet and also from lab test. The results from lab test have shown lower reflectance values of the tested newly coated samples than that of technical data sheets. All the samples are in the range of 75 to 80% reflectance except for the Sample # 5 (Albedo 100 has 25%) which is not a roof coating. From the aging test, a little reduction in reflectance value has been found which is up to 1.2% and not that significant whereas from manufacturers' data the reduction due to aging was found more around 13 to18%. It is to be noted that the test method in laboratory for this study is different than the test method followed by the manufacturer; this may be the reason why the reduction due to aging came insignificant. The energy saving benefits for all the cool coatings has shown similar results. The coatings having more reflectance value saves more cooling energy. From the analysis of surface temperature of roof and ceiling of the studied building, the outside roof temperature shows a huge reduction but inside ceiling shows minor reduction of temperature with the studied cool coatings compared to the case of existing bitumen roof. The temperature profile gave different picture for conditioned and non-conditioned options; non-conditioned options have higher inside surface temperature than conditioned one. Even for mechanical and natural ventilation of nonconditioned options are different; inside surface temperature is higher for mechanical ventilation option than natural one. The reduction of cooling energy is not huge but clear on the application of cool coatings on roof for all cool coatings applicable for roof. Sample#4 LANCO Ultrasiliconizer, having the highest reflectance of 80%, saves 7.4% of cooling energy annually. For the studied building, as Sample # 4 LANCO Ultra-Siliconizer having the highest reflectance value can be recommended to use on the roof for efficiency of cooling energy. A future research can be conducted based on this research as continuation by selecting a cold storage building of supermarket that requires huge cooling energy usage. The surface temperature on roof and ceiling for that selected building can be measured during summer season. The energy model can be validated using the local weather station data of the same year of measurement by comparing the model surface temperature with the measured surface temperature at the same location to make the experiment for closest accuracy. For aging test, the test method and standard to be followed as the same done by the manufacturer to arrive at a solid conclusion. For the other steps, methodology of this study can be followed. 52

Kool SealÂ® Premium White Elastomeric Roof Coating (63-600) is formulated with 100% acrylic elastomeric resin. The coating forms a thick rubber-like blanket of protection that expands and contracts with roofs. It remains fl exible from -30Â°F to 160Â°F for long-lasting protection and provides superior reflectivity to lower interior temperatures and save energy. Kool SealÂ® Premium White Elastomeric Roof Coat adheres to aged galvanized and prepainted metal, urethane and polystyrene, aged aluminum coating, precast concrete, flat and barrel cement tiles. For use on built-up roofs, modified bitumen, bonded tar & gravel, most other asphaltic surfaces and in ponding water situations, Kool SealÂ® Kool-LastikTM Primer (34-600) is required. Do not use on roofi ng shingles. In general, roof coatings, when applied to a structurally sound roof, will extend its life expectancy by protecting the roof from the elements. However, when roofs are badly deteriorated, they may require complete roof replacement instead of coating. If you're not sure, ask a qualified roofing contractor for an evaluation. Recommended uses: Â· Metal Â· Concrete Â· Foam Â· Brick Â· Flat Cement Tile Â· Unglazed Barrel Cement Tile Â· Aged Aluminum Coatings Â· Existing Elastomeric Roof Coatings When used with Kool-LastikTM Primer, recommended for: Â· Ponding Water Conditions Â· Rolled Roofing Â· Built-up Roofs Â· Modified Bitumen Â· Bonded Tar & Gravel Â· Most Asphaltic Surfaces

SURFACE PREPARATION
WARNING! Removal of old paint by sanding, scraping or other means may generate dust or fumes that contain lead. Exposure to lead dust or fumes may cause brain damage or other adverse health effects, especially in children or pregnant women. Controlling exposure to lead or other hazardous substances requires the use of proper protective equipment, such as a properly fitted respirator (NIOSH approved) and proper containment and cleanup. For more information, call the National Lead Information Center at 1-800-424-LEAD (in US) or contact your local health authority.

Coverage per gallon: (Apply two coats at the rates shown.) Metal (corrugated) 80 sq.ft. Metal (smooth) 100 sq.ft. Foam / Mod. Bit. 50 sq.ft. Concrete (depends on porosity) 50 sq.ft. Bonded Tar & Gravel / BUR 50 sq.ft.

Testing: Due to the wide variety of substrates, preparation methods, application methods and environments, the customer should test the product in an inconspicuous spot for adhesion and compatibility prior to full scale application. Remove all previous coating that is loose by scraping or wire brushing. Then, scrub the roof with a water and detergent solution to remove all dirt, oil and grease. Mildewed areas must be treated with 1 part chlorine bleach, 3 parts water, then washed with detergent. Rinse surface thoroughly and let dry. Simply sweeping a roof surface to remove dirt is ineffective. NOTE: Areas collecting ponding water lasting 2-3 days must be repaired using roof drains or other corrective measures. For less severe ponding areas or to be used on rolled roofing, built-up roofs, modified bitumen, bonded tar & gravel or most other asphaltic surfaces (excluding roofing shingles) you must first prime with Kool SealÂ® Kool-LastikTM Primer.

SURFACE PREPARATION
Kool-LastikTM Primer is not required or recommended for metal, coated metal, concrete, flat or barrel cement tile, brick or urethane foam. (See specific instructions listed below). Proceed to prime (if needed), then repair seams, cracks, and flashing as well as around skylights, vents, stacks, and other protrusions with Kool SealÂ® Acrylic Patching Cement (61-220) and Kool FlexxÂ® Reinforcing Grid (20-840). METAL: Remove rust and treat these areas with a quality metal primer. Tighten or totally replace loose fasteners. Then, top coat with Kool SealÂ® Premium White Elastomeric Roof Coating. CONCRETE: Repair cracks and any weakened sections of concrete with a good quality masonry cement before coating. Remove all salts of efflorescence (white crystal deposits) with a very mild water and muriatic acid solution. Then top coat with Kool SealÂ® Premium White Elastomeric Roof Coating. Over a period of time these deposits may again work their way through the coating. Should this occur, wash the coating with the mild muriatic acid solution to restore the coating's color. URETHANE FOAM: Repair cracks, holes, and indentations where water will collect with Kool SealÂ® Acrylic Patching Cement. Apply enough patching cement in several layers to indentations to allow water to drain. Then top coat with Kool SealÂ® Premium White Elastomeric Roof Coating.

SURFACE PREPARATION
BONDED TAR & GRAVEL: Remove all loose stones and scrub the roof with a water and detergent solution to remove all dirt, oil, and grease. Prime the surface with two coats of Kool-LastikTM Primer completely sealing all of the gravel to prevent moisture from seeping under the coating. Then, top coat with Kool SealÂ® Premium White Elastomeric Roof Coating. ROLLED ROOFING & MOD. BITUMEN: Scrub the roof with a water and detergent solution to remove all dirt, oil, and grease. Prime the surface with two coats of Kool-LastikTM Primer. Then, top coat with Kool SealÂ® Premium White Elastomeric Roof Coating.

APPLICATION
For spray application, an airless pump is recommended. Pump one gallon per minute with at least 2,000 PSI fluid pressure. Suggested tip sizes are .021 with a 10" pattern or .025 with a 12" pattern. This product has excellent suspension and requires minimal stirring to assure uniformity. If roof is hot, spray with water to prevent coating from drying too fast. May be applied over damp, not wet, surface. DO NOT USE ON RUBBER ROOFS. DO NOT USE ON FLAT ROOFS WITH A SLOPE OF 1/2 INCH OR LESS PER FOOT. For troublesome roofs and small shallow Ponding water situations, to include modified bitumen, rolled roofing, bonded tar and gravel, built-up roofs and most asphaltic SURFACES (excluding roofi ng shingles), you must apply two coats of Kool-LastikTM Primer then top coat with Kool SealÂ® Premium White Elastomeric Roof Coating. COVERAGE: Apply two coats to all surfaces at the rate shown. DO NOT DILUTE THIS PRODUCT.

APPLICATION
Do not apply when temperature is below 50Â°F or if the temperature is expected to drop below 50Â°F before the coating has completely dried. Drying time will take four to six hours in temperatures above 70Â°F with low humidity. Drying time will increase as temperature decreases or humidity is high. Humidity of 85% or more will drastically increase drying time. In areas where dew accumulates in early evening, it is best to coat in the morning. NOTE: Stop coating by early afternoon (3 p.m.) to prevent wash off, which will occur if dew, fog, or rain arrive before coating dries. For best results apply with a soft brush, 3/4" heavy nap roller, or airless sprayer. Avoid excessive brushing. Spread uniformly. Cover any previous coating. Always apply two coats in different directions. Apply the first coat in a north-south direction; the second in an east-west direction.

Albedo100Â®
Permanent Spray

Albedo100 Permanent Metallic is a permanent grey spray with light-reflective properties that sticks to most surfaces, and resists wind and rain. The spray is UV-resistant and is durable on materials such as wood, concrete, metal, stone etc. Albedo100 Permanent Metallic is appropriate for use on wheels on strollers, bicycles, gates, letter boxes, kayaks, garbage cans, tools, metal, painted surfaces, pavements, fences, nylon textiles, bicyclehelmets, etc.

How does it Work?
Albedo100 Light Metallic is a quick-drying lacquer that is grey in daylight and light-reflective in the dark. The spray reflects in the same direction as the light source. This means it is only the person behind the light source that can see the reflection. Test the effect by shining a light, held at eye-level, upon the sprayed surface. Alternatively taking a photo with flash e.g. with your mobile cell phone camera, or watching the object from a car with the headlights on, from a distance. Albedo100 Light Metallic is a permanent spray, however, in some cases it can be removed using mineral spirits. Note: mineral spirits can affect the original paint work

How to Use
1. 2. Always spray outside or in well-ventilated areas. Shake the can vigorously +1 minute (at least 20 sec after you hear the bulb inside). Repeat during application. After shaking, spray immediately from a distance of approximately 1 foot, with even swiping movements. Hold the can upright while spraying. Do not over-apply. Dries in a couple of minutes at normal room temperature. Clean the nozzle after use, by spraying upside down for 1-2 sec.

3.

Important:
Make sure the object to be sprayed is dry, and that dirt, grease and other loose particles are removed before application. The spray attaches to dry surfaces. Some surfaces and certain plastics may need to be treated with a primer before use in order to achieve optimum and durable results over time. Pliable surfaces may stiffen if sprayed with Albedo100 Light Metallic. You can easily create reflective signs and symbols by cutting out, and spraying on stencils.
