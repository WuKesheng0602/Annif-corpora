Developing a model of post-workshop consultation for clinicians learning to deliver Cognitive Processing Therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder Doctor of Philosophy, 2017 Psychology

Abstract

Meredith Sara Herman Landy Ryerson University

Best practice in training clinicians to deliver evidence-based psychotherapies

includes workshop attendance followed by post-workshop consultation. Although previous research highlights the importance of consultation, little is known about what makes for effective consultation, and no model of clinical consultation currently exists. The primary aims of this study were to identify the primary elements of consultation, and develop a model of consultation in a sample of clinicians learning to deliver Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT; Resick, Monson, & Chard, 2014), an evidence-based psychotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder. useful for theory building.

Introduction Policymakers are investing billions of dollars to train clinicians to deliver

evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs; Karlin et al., 2010; McHugh & Barlow, 2010). Attending an EBP workshop often leads to increased provider knowledge (Fixsen, Naoom, Base, Friedman, & Wallace, 2005), but is insufficient for the majority of

clinicians to become proficient in delivering the intervention with fidelity (Beidas & 2005). Fidelity to treatment is indispensable, as it is a strong predictor of symptom change and clinical outcome in the treatment of a variety of mental health

conditions (e.g. Martino, Ball, Nich, Frankforter, & Carroll, 2008; Schoenwald, Carter, Chapman, & Sheidow, 2008; Strunk, Brotman, DeRubeis, & Hollon, 2010). Providing clinicians with post-workshop support, such as group consultation with an expert, improves their fidelity to treatment (Beidas, Edmunds, Marcus, & Kendall, 2012; Schoenwald, Sheidow, & Letournea, 2004).

Beidas, Edmunds, Marcus, & Kendall, 2012; Edmunds, Beidas, & Kendall, 2013), little is known about the specifics of consultation and what are the necessary components that contribute to successful consultation (Milne & Westerman, 2001; Beidas et al., 2013; Nadeem et al., 2013b; Rakovshik & McManus, 2010). An important next step

The proposed model describing what is posited to occur during clinical consultation is a first step toward replicating that process in clinical settings, and testing which elements of consultation are most closely associated with proficient delivery of CPT.

The United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has undertaken a large effort to disseminate Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT; Resick & Schnicke, 1992) and Prolonged Exposure (PE; Foa, Hembree, & Rothbaum, 2007), evidencebased psychotherapies for PTSD, throughout the VA health care system (Karlin et al., 2010). Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) and its national network of Operational Stress Injury (OSI) clinics are engaged in a similar effort to disseminate evidence-based 2011).

One study looked at five different types of training (workshop only, workshop and feedback on practice tapes, workshop plus substance abuse professionals who attended a Motivational Interviewing (MI)

Researchers found that clinicians in the coaching and feedback condition became the most proficient in MI.

Schoenwald, Sheidow, and Chapman (2009) noted the scarcity of studies examining topic published between 1981 and 1997, with only 3 of them published in or after 1993. These writers also highlighted the profound methodological limitations of these studies. For example, they noted the lack of validated measures to assess be influenced by supervision, and the vague definitions and measures of client outcomes. Notably, the most frequently assessed client outcome has been

One of the biggest impediments to conducting good research on supervision and consultation is that both modalities improve the quality and clinical utility of the supervision literature, Milne and (Milne et al., 2008). remain poorly defined and conceptualized (Milne et al., 2008).

A Model of Clinical Supervision To address deficiencies in the clinical supervision literature, Milne and

colleagues (2008) conducted a "best evidence synthesis" review of the literature to develop a model explaining how clinical supervision works (see Figure 1). Their model is grounded in empirical literature and can be tested. This approach involved creating a codebook detailing the extraction of relevant qualitative and quantitative information from the articles reviewed. After coding the articles, the reviewers conducted reliability checks to ensure consistency and reduce bias among coders. contextual variables, supervision interventions, and outcomes.

Based on this careful extraction, the reviewers organized key findings according to Contextual variables were defined as both qualitative and quantitative

factors that influenced the strength of the association between the independent and dependent variables. Supervision interventions, referred to as "mediators" in this context, were defined as mechanisms that explained the association between the independent and dependent variables. For example, Socratic dialogue was

conceptualized as a mediator. Outcomes were defined as the change process, or the Additionally, the resultant change in a supervisee's understanding was also treated variable, as was the process of reflection, which was thought to increase the

collaborative style and responsiveness to tailoring consultation to suit their needs and answer their questions. This tailoring of consultation helped ensure time was spent efficiently, and served to further reinforce feelings of connectedness among the therapists and the consultant. Therapists expressed that a limitation to the feedback, and that the desire for individualized feedback posed a threat to group format was that it did not provide adequate opportunity for individualized responsiveness.

In the present study, social comparison among clinicians may function to create standards for proficient delivery of CPT. Specifically, clinicians who are less proficient at the outset of consultation may become increasingly proficient as

According to Lewin, groups have 18 Kurt Lewin (1947) introduced the term "group dynamics" as part of his

Groups can be described in terms of the roles, norms, and cohesiveness of their

Difficulties in communication can reduce the effectiveness of groups. Cohesiveness is defined as "the resultant of all forces acting on the members to remain part of the variable that is the product of many factors. When a group is highly cohesive its members respect each other and wish to continue associating as a group.

Cohesiveness is based on perceived similarity among group members. Groups high in cohesiveness are highly satisfied by being together, whereas an external force must maintain groups low in cohesiveness. Accordingly, in the present study group consultation.

cohesiveness may be an important contextual factor that influences learning during A group of researchers developed a methodology to identify themes

emerging in small group dynamics (Neuman, Assaf, & Cohen, 2012). This

methodological approach derives its data from transcriptions of group members' verbal utterances. Themes are then derived from the textual data. An important conceptual assumption is that the group as a whole is viewed as being qualitatively and relationships among group members a "matrix" (p. 292). This approach posits 19

At the same time, role ambiguity, low team commitment, and social loafing can be exacerbated in the virtual team context (O'Hara-Devereaux & Johansen, 1994). Recent research on supervision (Brooks, Patterson, & McKiernan,

Therefore, conducting a realist evaluation involves identifying mechanisms (M) through which the intervention occurs, contextual factors (C) that influence the intervention's outcome, and describing how their combination leads to the intervention's desired outcomes (O).

transcripts and checked them back against the original audio recordings to identify errors in transcription. No major errors were identified (i.e. nothing that would change the meaning of a statement). Only minor errors were identified (i.e. typos). As the writer of this dissertation reviewed the calls, she noted initial ideas about patterns in the data. Additionally, the researchers read each of the transcripts with

an eye toward identifying patterns in the data. After listening to the consultation 37

calls and reviewing the transcripts, the researchers worked together to generate an initial list of ideas about patterns in the data. Phase 2. In the second phase, the researchers coded the data and created the

The team's findings were used to create the first draft of the codebook, a document that included definitions and examples of each of the codes. KM, the committee member with expertise in

qualitative research, guided the coders through this process. The codebook was

updated during every discussion, which occurred after each transcript was coded.

The researchers focused on ensuring that codes were distinct from one another, and that they could be adequately operationalized and differentiated from one another. Next, the researchers coded the entire data set. Candidate codes were added

(see Results). The process of clearly defining and appropriately naming the themes involved several iterations. It consisted of a series of conversations between all of the coders (ML, EV, and SB) and the committee member (KM). The conversations focused on identifying the essence of each theme. Importantly, this phase also included discussions about what aspect of the data each theme captured, the research questions.

The final analysis included several conversations between the author (ML) and the committee member (KM) to ensure the analysis and reporting were consistent with the realist framework and met its requirements for reporting results (Greenlagh et al., 2014). It involved careful consideration of the function of each element of consultation, and how the elements of consultation function together. Vivid

examples of each element of consultation were extracted from the transcripts and used to illustrate the findings. Several draft theories were created to explain how consultation works. After multiple iterations, a final theory of consultation was 2013; Pawson & Tilley, 1997) were generated as causal explanations for how

Reliability Establishing inter-rater reliability is an integral component of conducting

agreement for categorical items (Cohen, 1960) that is frequently used in qualitative research. Since Cohen's kappa coefficient takes into consideration the possibility that the inter-rater agreement occurred by chance, it is considered to be a more robust measure than percent agreement calculation (Gwet, 2014).

process of consultation. The following contextual factors were identified: access to technological disruptions, and study participation. A rationale for their inclusion is General Contextual Factors Access to Group Support. Although the consultation process was designed

to be a group experience, on several occasions clinicians were absent and only one clinician participated on the call. When this occurred, calls were typically much The consultant's statement, "It looks like you are the only one on the call" shorter in duration compared with when multiple group members were present.

On the other hand, consultation calls where only one clinician was present may have provided greater opportunity for that clinician to receive individualized attention or feedback, and to have his or her questions or concerns addressed consultation input may have been advantageous for clinician learning. without considering the needs of other clinicians. The receipt of individualized Clinician joins late. During the calls, there were several instances of

connectedness between group members, which may have in turn detracted from the

clinicians failing to be present at the beginning of the call, and then joining the call once the discussion was well underway. This contextual factor captured instances or had missed a considerable amount of content when he or she joined. The (Transcript 4, p. 3) was an example of this contextual factor. The clinician's where a clinician was more than a few minutes late when he or she joined the call, consultant's statement, "Oh, it looks like we've got somebody. Hi, who joined?" statement, made more than halfway into the call, "I just joined a few minutes ago.

It's [Name X]" (Transcript 5, p. 11) was another example of this contextual factor. 43

Additionally, the transcriptionist's note "New clinician joins" (Transcript 2, p. 10; Transcript 10, p. 9) was used to identify the presence of this contextual factor. There were several ways in which a clinician joining the call late may have

influenced the consultation process. First, the clinician who joined the call late did not have the benefit of hearing the material that was discussed previously on the missed a significant part of the discussion may have received a smaller dose of consultation has been associated with dosing, clinicians who received less consultation call. Clinicians who were late repeatedly, or who were so late that they consultation compared with clinicians who were punctual. Since the success of consultation may have benefitted less from consultation compared with clinicians who received a larger dose. Second, joining the call late temporarily disrupted the flow of the call and the conversation. This disruption may have caused participants to lose their train of thought, interfered with them developing and expressing fully their ideas, and may ultimately have detracted from the quality of the discussion at

that time. Third, the disruption sometimes meant that the agenda had to be adjusted partway through the call to ensure the clinician who joined late was able to have his or her needs met by the call. This could have resulted in less time being spent on have left the consultant believing there was insufficient time to meet all the each agenda item than the consultant anticipated originally. In some cases, it may clinicians' needs. Fourth, it may have interfered with connectedness among the clinicians, and between the clinician who joined late and the consultant. The punctual participants may have felt annoyed by the interruption, and interpreted

experience, which may have in turn detracted from the connectedness among that clinician and the rest of the group. Finally, if being late reflected a clinician's poor attitude toward consultation, the attitude may have functioned as a barrier to learning.

toward the beginning of the consultation process than toward the middle or the end, there were examples from all of the phases of consultation where clinicians participated on the call, but did not have any questions to ask or case material to discuss. Commonly, this occurred either when a clinician had not yet begun working with a client, or when a clinician had not seen a client since the previous consultation call, and therefore did not have any new questions arise or case material to present. Other times, it occurred when the clinician reported that things were going smoothly with the client and that he or she did not have any questions. The clinician's statement, "I am in the process of picking someone up, but I haven't

The following quotation also demonstrated that the clinician I'm somewhat like [Name X] here in that I have two patients in the clinical trial and I spoke about them in the last meeting, but I haven't met with them since that meeting. One of them is coming in here later today just like with [Name Y] and the other is coming in later this week. So I have nothing really new to update at this time. I think all of my questions were answered last week. (Transcript 18, p. 3)

proportion of the total time on the call was spent talking about or resolving the

statement, "I was just having some technical difficulties at my end" (Transcript 5, p. 46

Clinician X: It's [Name X]. Doesn't sound like she can hear you.

The following excerpt also exemplified Attendance: Clinician V: Yes I am, hello. Clinician W: Hi.

Consultant: I do have all your names, so let me just check to see who is all on the call. Uh, I see on left hand side it looks like [Name V], are you here? Consultant: And [Name W]? Consultant: Hi. And [Name X]?

Clinician X: Yes. Good morning.

Consultant: Okay, and that's all that's showing. I'm not seeing [Name Y] or [Name Z]. Are they on and I'm just not seeing them? Clinician 3: No, I haven't heard them (Transcript 10, p. 1-2). Taking attendance may have functioned to create a sense of order and

accountability, facilitated cohesion among group members, and helped with setting an efficient agenda. Agenda Setting. "Agenda Setting" refers to the consultants' efforts to

organize how time on the call was spent. Typically, the consultants facilitated the process of setting the agenda near the beginning of the call, which created a to be discussed based on the clinicians' needs and questions. The following quotation from a consultant exemplified Agenda Setting: structure for the remainder of the call. This process involved creating a list of items

All right, so let's talk about making an agenda. [Name X] is looking at patients and so let's talk about if it's all right with you, talk about this person that [Name X] is going to see shortly to talk about her therapy and then let's talk about what about multiple traumas and what about they've been exposed to, what looks like very traumatizing events yet with capturing their attention they seem to want to talk about more organizational things which is not to say those are not very disturbing experiences too but...and maybe [Name Y's] not going to get on after all. (Transcript 9, p. 3) 51

The following excerpt also exemplified Agenda Setting:

Consultant: Well, why don't we go ahead, and I can figure out from you both, how many sessions, if any, you were able to get under your belt this past week, and we can begin to start to set an agenda while we wait for those folks to join us. Let me just go down to my notes here. So [Name X], it looks like we left off that you were fairly early in the process? Clinician X: Yes, I have had one more session since our last conference, so I've now had three sessions. Consultant: So you're at session number three, [Name X]? Clinician X: Yes.

Clinician X: That's right. She was supposed to come in today, but had to cancel, so I might get started, possibly do the baseline session in one or two weeks. Consultant: So we can talk about your session number three today. How about you, [Name Y]? Consultant: And then [Name Y], is that session tomorrow going to be the baseline session, or have you already completed that baseline? Clinician Y: Done the baseline - it's going to be session number one. Clinician Y: I have managed to enroll one person, and I'm starting with him tomorrow morning.

Consultant: Just making a note of that. Okay, so we can chat about that session. And then I have a note that you had a woman that might be willing to start in April, the woman who served in Afghanistan, did that play out yet?

Consultant: And [Name Z], how about you, how are things going for you?

Clinician Z: I'm up to, I just finished the sixth session with my one client, and I just started up another one here today, in terms of doing the baseline, just actually did that before our meeting here. Consultant: So we'll get caught up on that. Well, I tell you what, in the interest of time then, why don't we back up and [Name X], do you want to chat about session number three, and tell us how it went, and if there's any questions about it?

What I'd like to spend the call on, which normally is what we'll do on every call, is I'll ask you to give me a brief overview of your caseload. The first time that you introduce a client, if you'll tell me their age and gender and what their index trauma is that you're working on in CPT, that is how I will keep notes on that person. So I don't ever get their name. I just do it by age and gender. That typically is okay. Every now and then I'll have somebody with 53

two 49-year-old females and then we're just hoping that the index trauma isn't the same, and if they are, then we'll find some other identifier. And then, on a weekly basis, when you check in at the beginning of the calls, I'll ask you to give me an update on the clients that you're seeing, including what their session number is. I usually also ask for the PCL score, just because it gives me an idea of what their symptoms are looking like. And then I'll ask you for whatever questions you have for the call today. And then once I do check in with everybody, I'll go back and start to respond to those questions one by one, after check in. That allows me to budget my time a little bit better. So please any questions that you do have, feel free to put them out there when you're checking in because sometimes I won't leave time at the end of the call for just anything else. Sometimes we'll have time for that, but other times not. (Transcript 7, p. 3-4) for that. And that brings us to [Name X]," (Transcript 1, p. 4) is an example of how addressed, and then segueing to the next clinician. The consultant's statement, "I can address that a little bit as well.

In session two, it really starts to get more information from the client but not in terms of challenging. At this point in session two all we're really doing is trying to understand the stuck points.

make use of those reactions in session. How the clinician handled challenges that

My other guy, we've taken our first out of three sessions to step out of the protocol. He's a little bit more challenging because a lot of his stuck points are around childhood abuse so family of origin, mom was really invalidating, dad was physically abusive and he had an interaction with his father where at age 18 his father kicked him out of the house and just physically pushed him out of the house and he never went back. So, he went back to help his dad do something this last week and his 80-year-old father punched him and then tried to get him out of the house and it replayed some of the stuck points. So, we talked about how he coped with that moment, and what was interesting was, even though we stepped out of the protocol he was talking about the skills that he'd learned I think while on session eight with him and what he said was, "You know I kept saying to myself I don't need to be afraid of him, he can't hurt me anymore. I can tell him to not treat me this way and I have the right to do that." So he said, "My internal dialogue was different. Like I was challenging those old stuck points that we've been working on" and what he realized from the conversation with his father and how abusive his father was, even though I think his father is in his late 70s or 80s, is that these are the things that cause him to have difficulties at work because his stuck points are he keeps expecting anybody in a position of authority to treat him this way. So, even though we stepped out of the protocol, we were actually using all of the stuff in the protocol and he said, "That's the first time I ever talked back to my dad. It's the first time that I sort of said I will not let you bully me or treat me this way. I am worth it and what you say about me doesn't define me." Part of what he over did was, he realized that he was hoping that his dad's reaction would be different. He put that sort of external logistic control where, if my dad backs down, if my dad says, "You're right I abused you," that the world would be okay and his dad just kicked him out again and said, "You're dead to me." So we're dealing with some of the grief issues and I need to go back in the next session and talk about how when we do something for a result of change in the other person, and use that as the determinant of whether or not we were successful, there's a stuck point there that we need to work on. (Transcript 16, p. 3) The following excerpt exemplified a collaborative Case Conceptualization 59

between a consultant and clinician:

Consultant: Okay, and so tell us how did, we'll start with your 38-year-old, how did that turn out in the end? Do you remember what her final PCL was? (Transcriptionist's note: Other clinician joins meeting.) Clinician: Her final PCL was basically 54. Consultant: What did it start out as?

Clinician: Ah man, we started out, it was high, we started out it was 66, and basically it stayed high right till that seventh session where we kind of discussed it, and for eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, it basically floated anywhere between about 49 and 54, 55. Consultant: So, tell us a little bit about how you wrapped up with her. Clinician: Oh, well you know, it was really interesting, it was a bit of a surprise because basically for that session, 10 and 11, she was really, well, you know, to the point where...Well, I think I need some more sessions - do you think perhaps we could go over some other ones again, and really just different things coming in and out, and just throwing some things out there. But we really held to the fact that we're going to do the 12, and we got some follow up things happening, and I have to say that her final impact statement was, it surprised me. Consultant: Surprised you how?

Clinician: It was quite empowering for her, compared to the first one, and you know we really had a good discussion around the differences in that impact statement.

ways. First, the standardized format for presenting cases seemed to orient clinicians taught clinicians to administer routinely, and interpret correctly, the PCL, consider carefully various forms of avoidance, and identify stuck points. Second, discussing 60

cases may have helped clinicians connect theory with practice by solidifying the content that was presented during the workshops. In this way, case conceptualization likely contributed to knowledge consolidation. Third, during this process clinicians seemed to reflect on what occurred in sessions, which may have also assisted with knowledge consolidation. For example, discussing clients' stuck points with the group likely helped clinicians understand what a stuck point is.

When a clinician heard a potential stuck point in session and then brought it to the group to discuss, the process of reflection and discussion likely helped clarify both the concept of a stuck point and how that particular stuck point was maintaining a

client's PTSD. In a similar way, this process may have helped clinicians deepen their cases, and how to make use of the worksheets and assignments that are specific to the therapy (e.g., trauma account, ABC sheets).

the position of actively guiding their learning process. Through directing their

conceptualized as comprising this element of consultation: 1) specific advice on the case being discussed, and 2) general advice about how to handle particular types of clients, situations, or issues. Consultants frequently gave advice on the following topics: when to accept a client's perception and when to challenge a client's stuck clients completed the PCL in relation to their index trauma; how and why to

Typically, these included the consultant discussing her own cases, personal

examples, stories, anecdotes, or offering an explanation of her usual practice. These experiences had the feeling of being "tricks of the trade". Consultants often shared their experiences with regard to the following: how to generate stuck points with clients who have a hard time generating them on their own, and how to be collaborative when working with a client to generate stuck points; how to work effectively with people who are abusing substances, and how to conceptualize accurately their substance use; the benefits of working within a structured protocol; the extent to which patients have to grasp a concept before moving onto the next one; how to adapt the protocol for clients with particular needs (e.g., low literacy levels); less common ways in which avoidance can manifest (e.g., excessive sex, examples shared by consultants illustrated Sharing a Personal Experience:

exercise, work); and, how to work effectively with difficult patients. The following We've even had, I had a gentleman recently - his trauma was childhood and he used his experience to speak to gangs and try to reduce gang-related violence through the context of his job, and so he had actually spoken about his trauma in significant detail. So, that absolutely can happen. It was interesting when we went through the therapy - he was emotional when he got to disclosing details of his trauma, and I had anticipated that he wouldn't be, just because he does it so often quite publicly, and what I found was there was a bit of a different between kind of a public version and the way we specifically asked him to do it in CPT. So, I don't know whether that will play out with your client in terms of moving through that avoidance and so forth. They may just have asked her to tell them about it but not necessarily get into the details, or maybe that really get into the meaningfulness of the trauma, which I think catches a lot of that natural emotion. (Transcript 17, p. 2)

Yeah, I mean um, I'm working with a guy right now where we've been talking about power and control for the last two or three sessions, and we have a couple more sessions to go, and we'll still be talking about power and control. I mean he had power and control issues before the trauma - he's got power and control issues now. And, um I think power and control is a really 67

interesting thing that people with anxiety disorders, especially if they were pre-existing, I think pre-existing he had you know, kind of some GAD and there's just a lot of wanting to control his environment - very "type a". And so I don't expect that CPT is going to cure that - I think that that's going to be, he's a little bit hardwired that way and it's a long time of learning, and so to me that's just something you develop, that ability to kind of keep that need for control in check and like really reminding yourself that that's impossible to have a hundred percent control over things...For my guy, the power and control was there before the trauma ever laid on top of it. But when he finally you know, was really faced with the fact that okay I do not have control, um, it was just overwhelming to him. But now we're having to deal with the fact that he wants to have power and control and always has, um so it's, over everything so it's very, um, it's become kind of bigger than PTSD.

consultant encourages the clinician to reflect on a central concept or idea,

application of the protocol, or the particularities of how to execute a component of the protocol. The following topics were explored through the use of Socratic Questioning: the importance of imposing structure on the sessions; the need to

helping clients overcome avoidance. Socratic Questioning was also used to elicit

deliver CPT as prescribed in the manual; and, the role of the structured protocol in

clinicians' thoughts on their cases. For example, consultants probed clinicians to

thinking around this issue, and to help her arrive at a decision about how to proceed. The consultant's statement, "How would you say that to a client? I mean in this situation, how you would guide her through that?" (Transcript 8, p. 7) exemplified Additionally, the following example illustrated the use of Socratic

consultants appeared to use Socratic questioning when there was a need for the clinician to make an important decision. In some instances, the consultant used Socratic questioning to function as a correction ­ to help the clinician realize what instead. Through careful use of Socratic questioning, consultants led clinicians

Consultants praised case formulation; asking good questions; working well with clients; offering an the protocol; and, engaging with the process of consultation. The following

sentiment "good job" or "nicely done". Although Praise was usually directed toward clinicians for the following reasons: enrolling clients; presenting a well-reasoned illustrative example of a central concept; identifying key stuck points; adhering to statement exemplified a consultant's use of Praise directed toward the group:

Excellent. You guys are so wonderful because you're really getting at the heart of what we need to be addressing, is what's going on in your own minds when you're choosing cases. The fact that you're so willing and open to discuss this and get feedback from me is lovely. (Transcript 4, p. 29-30)

The following excerpt illustrated a consultant's use of Praise directed toward Consultant: It sounds like she's looking a whole lot different. She's doing a lot less "should, should" and she's allowing some of that natural emotion to dissipate. Clinician: Yeah, so it seems like she's on the right track, so...

praising something seemed to draw attention to it, and signal its importance.

Praise was used to highlight what a clinician was doing well. The act of

other times it was more general. The consultants' statements, "Any other issues (Transcript 1, p. 4), and "Anybody have questions about that person?" (Transcript Asking clinicians if they had questions appeared to function to foster a

culture of curiosity, inquiry, and reflection. The frequent invitation to ask questions seemed to normalize the experience of not knowing, and encouraged clinicians to seek clarification as needed. Additionally, by encouraging clinicians to ask questions, the consultants gave the clinicians the opportunity to guide their learning process by determining the content of the calls. This likely reflected the consultants' commitment to facilitating clinician learning by tailoring the calls to meet their

needs. Through these statements, the consultants may have sent the clinicians the

message that they should be reflecting on what occurs in session, and they regarded the act of asking questions as a valued and necessary component of learning.

Connectedness Connectedness is posited to be a mechanism of consultation.

"Encouragement" and "Validation" are elements of consultation that foster connectedness. Encouragement. "Encouragement" refers either to statements made by

consultants that serve to make the clinicians feel confident about the therapy going forward, or about the progress they can expect to make with their learning. Encouragement captured statements that were future-oriented. Typically, Encouragement was offered around the process of learning the therapy,

understanding the therapy, and clarifying the therapy's terminology. The most would get easier the more comfortable they became with the protocol. The following examples illustrated Encouragement:

frequent form of Encouragement was letting clinicians know that delivering CPT

I hear what you're saying, and you don't want to be in the position that you're drawing the line in the sand at session one and he's clearly saying, "This is what I want to work on," and you're clearly saying, "I don't really care what you want to work on, this is what we're working on". You don't want that perception to come across at all, so I hear what you're saying because that would be very invalidating, and the antithesis of empowerment that we see with these clients in CPT. (Transcript 2, p. 9) Validation may have functioned to normalize clinicians' experiences, which

in turn may have helped to reduce their anxiety around the learning process. With reduced anxiety, clinicians may have been able to problem solve more effectively. Additionally, knowing that others have struggled to learn the therapy, especially the consultants who are likely to be perceived as knowledgeable and competent, may have functioned to reassure the clinicians of their own capacity to deliver CPT process by making it seem like a predictable experience, contributing to the 77

And, I have a couple of people coming in, within this next week, that I'm hoping may be candidates to be my second person, but I haven't actually done another session since I talked to you last, so I don't really have much more. Consultant: So, you don't have any questions, probably, at this point, is what you're saying? Clinician: No. Right. (Transcript 11, p. 1) Access to individual support occurred when so many clinicians were absent

from a call that the sole clinician present received individual consultation. Although this likely hindered learning in several respects, it may have enhanced learning in each other's cases. The clinicians who were absent did not have the benefit of case did not have the benefit of hearing the perspectives of the other group others. The absence of a group dynamic meant that clinicians could not learn from hearing the material discussed on the call, and the clinician presenting his or her members. Additionally, when clinicians were alone on the call they may have felt by a consultant, reflected her concern that the lack of a group experience would negatively affect learning:

disconnected from the clinicians who were absent. The following statement, made

I wonder where everybody else is today. We had [Name X] on last time, and we had [Name Y]. There's supposed to be a few other people. One of them I knew was going to be absent today. You know, it's okay if we are a little bit rocky getting started, but my only concern is then it just doesn't seem like you guys get the benefit of the consultation if we're ending up not being able to have cases `cus it's a dead call for you guys, so I feel badly about that. (Transcript 3, p. 4)

affected the success of a particular consultation call, in turn contributing to the extent to which clinicians were able to make use of the consultation process to achieve proficiency. Under optimal circumstances, technology functioned well, the prepared with questions to ask or case material to discuss.

call was well attended, the clinicians joined the call on time, and the clinicians came It is posited that an overarching function of consultation is knowledge

consolidation. A thorough understanding of both the therapy's underlying theory and content are thought to be the foundation upon which clinicians deliver treatment and conceptualize cases. Knowledge consolidation is thought to occur

primarily through information-based teaching. The content of information-based exemplified a clinician Asking a Factual Question, and the consultant's reply

teaching was determined primarily by clinicians' questions. The following excerpt

exemplified Information-Based Teaching:

Clinician: ... I'm just wondering if you can remind me what a stuck point would sound like if it was an assimilated one versus an 1accommodated one. Consultant: ...So assimilated, when we talk about it in the training we talk about assimilated are usually looking in the past, like looking back and they usually are things like self-blame, so "I should have done this" and it usually

Note: This clinician has used the term "accommodated" when the correct term is "overaccommodated". In the consultant's reply, she uses the term "over-accommodated".

results in a lot of guilt or shame. They can also be undoing. Undoing is where you kind of try to somehow take it back. So like for assault it could look like, "I guess he didn't understand that I didn't want it, so it wasn't really alright." I've even seen people try to undo by saying things like, "I just shouldn't have reacted this strongly. I'm in war, so I know bad things happen, so I shouldn't be having this reaction. It should not have upset me". Assimilating can also be other-blame, which is when you kind of inappropriately blame somebody else. So, "My commanding officer should have done something different, or was lazy and didn't care and that's why this happened". So, it can be, sometimes other people like the perpetrator do have responsibility and are to blame, but when people are inappropriately assigning blame. So like, "My parents should have protected me from the abuse," but maybe the parents didn't know. So that kind of thing. So that's all assimilated. Basically, looking back and trying to change something about what happened, or about how you see the world in order to make sense of it. Over-accommodated is when you're kind of looking in the present and future. So, now this has happened to me, now that I was assaulted, or I saw this death, or I experienced this event now I know from here going forward that I'm a bad person, so I can never trust anyone. I'll never be safe no matter where I go - that the world is just out to get me. Okay, so these over-accommodated it's like now I have changed my belief system. I've recognized that I was traumatized, but now I've gone overboard in looking at how I'm going to view the rest of the world and myself in light of the traumatic event. So that's over-accommodated, and our goal is to get to that balanced belief of accommodation, which is the inbetween where you look at, okay this is what happened, this is a balanced view of what happened, I'm taking responsibility where I need to but I'm not taking too much, I'm putting it where I need to and I have a balanced view of, "Yes, there is evil but not everyone is evil."

conceptualization seemed to further facilitate the process of knowledge

Along with asking a factual question and information-based teaching, case

In this way, case clarifying and deepening their understanding of central concepts through conceptualization contributed to knowledge consolidation. At the same time,

reinforce knowledge of the protocol. For example, in the following quotation from a associated with therapy (i.e., "impact statement", "stuck points", "impact statement", Clinician: Definitely in sessions two and when he was reading his impact statement and this last session we did discuss some of his emotional response and reaction. I don't know if it's hard to say, but even though the PCL score doesn't seem to indicate intense symptoms he definitely feels like he has PTSD. It's definitely present in the room. (Transcriptionist's note: Consultant asks clinician to provide background information about the client). Say a little bit about his situation, he was in Afghanistan. He came home in September of 2012 and the key events were around IEDs. Well actually there was sort of involving children. He was involved in picking up body parts and things like that and another incident was he had to take out an insurgent with his vehicle he was driving in a convoy and so he had some good stuck points he developed right off in session one which were, "I always have to be prepared in situations because something might go wrong," [and] "People can't be trusted." In session two after he had written his impact statement, 87

also done some stuck points around that and they are things like "Other people can't be trusted," "People in authority always abuse their power," "I should be able to protect others," "It's ideal to have several contingency plans," "I'm not deserving of time for myself," "I can't trust human command especially the new chain of command." So those are some of the stuck points we are working on right now. He got talking about him writing trauma accounts. I brought up, it appeared like emotions from him in sessions two and three. So we did ABC, we did actually two ABC sheets - one on (inaudible) therapy and some o[n] the thoughts, "I'll be out of control. I won't be able to control it. It'll be embarrassing." Just off the top of my head right now cuz I don't have the ABC sheet with me. And then we did another one on writing the traumatic account as well and it was the same thing, "I won't be able to (inaudible) anyone there to support me." Those were some of the beliefs that we (inaudible) and he did a really good job. He's actually really on top of his ability to kind of challenge things and do his homework, so that's really good. So, yeah that's where I left him and we discussed him doing it. Actually today he's going to write his trauma account. I see him next Tuesday so. (Transcript 1, p. 6) identifying examples from their clinical work all seemed to help clinicians consolidate their knowledge of the therapy. Articulating what was done in session, using the protocol's terminology, and

knowledge of the protocol facilitated accurate case conceptualization. In particular, it is posited that as clinicians deepened their understanding of the therapy's components and its underlying theory, they were able to conceptualize their cases "My client's PCL - there's a heavy matter of avoidance" (Transcript 2, p. 7), reflects her attunement to the role of avoidance as a maintaining factor in PTSD. In the excerpt that follows, which exemplified Case Conceptualization, the 88

- as case conceptualization reinforced knowledge of the protocol, deepened

essential functions of consultation, and their relationship seemed to be bidirectional

Knowledge consolidation and case conceptualization are thought to be

in an increasingly accurate and nuanced way. For example, the clinician's statement,

clinician's efforts to conceptualize her case reflects the centrality of identifying

"stuck points" when delivering CPT. The consultant's attention to these stuck points, as well as the explicit connection that was drawn between the stuck points and the client's emotions seemed to reinforce the clinician's case conceptualization skills and understanding of the therapy.

Clinician: ...It's been pretty hard, trying to help him look at ways that he thinks that are blocking his recovery. But this last session, he did much better because he came in reading his account and really letting himself feel a lot more of the distress about it. And there is still a lot of self-blame and guilt. So, things like `I should have done something different', `I should have stopped it', `all authority can't be trusted', `nobody is going to help', `if I had done the right thing, I wouldn't be getting punished by bad dreams and feeling bad now so I must have done something wrong'. And then, he also has this belief that if he had just gone in and shot all of the allied troops that were raping him that, somehow, the world would have realized that. And this country ... this is an acceptable practice. And if he could just get the world to realize that, then children wouldn't get hurt and we wouldn't send troops to Afghanistan. So, those are the key stuck beliefs, right now, that I am working with him with. Consultant: So, those kinds of beliefs, would you mind re-stating the last two really quick? I was writing them down. I want to make sure I got them correct. Consultant: So, what are the stuck points about blame?

Clinician: So, clearly, there is self-blame and guilt. And I think that is shifting because he is getting in that context. Clinician: "If I had done something different and stopped it, the child wouldn't have been hurt," "I should have gone (inaudible)". So, his sense is that a child got hurt because he failed to act. Consultant: So, there are the two ends. So, there is the self-blame that can come from `I should have done something different'. Clinician: Yes.

Clinician: He doesn't believe it's his fault that it happened. 89

Consultant: And then, it can translate to `it's my fault this happened'. Now, does he believe it's his fault this happened?

Consultant: But he does think he should have done something different? Clinician: He thinks that he should have done something different. (Transcript 6, p. 12) The overarching functions of consultation, knowledge consolidation and case

conceptualization, are posited to be supported through several elements of

consultation that have been categorized as follows: Asking for Help, Directive or more of the elements played a supportive role in ensuring knowledge

Instruction, Non-Directive Instruction, and Provision of Feedback. Often times, one consolidation or case conceptualization. In some ways, these four categories of support knowledge consolidation and case conceptualization. There was

elements can be viewed as the tools employed by either clinicians or consultants to considerable flexibility in the order in which the tools were used. This variability in sequencing is reflected visually in the model of consultation (see Figure 2). During consultation calls, engaging in case conceptualization often led

clinicians to identify and articulate what they needed help with. For this reason, case conceptualization often preceded asking for help. The following excerpt included the end of a clinician's Case Conceptualization followed by her Asking for Help:

[CASE CONCEPTUALIZATION]...She came about ten or so minutes late, so the session was only about forty minutes, but I did get her to read it and we started to identify some points in the trauma account. Um, but part of her story was that when she, right after the situation she found that, like when she called the operator they were really cold and distant to her, so she felt like you know that they weren't really caring about her and then when the police came and did the investigation she felt like they were really cold, annoyed and irritated with her. So, at the end of that session I really just kind of turned everything off and just spent a bit of time just reconnecting with her just to you know let her know that there's support for her and kind of get that connection just to confirm that and [ASKING FOR HELP] maybe you have some ideas too [Name of Consultant] on like connecting at this point on the learning curve and with working with the model and probably a little bit 90

maybe (inaudible) you know kind of just trying to make sure I tick the boxes and follow the steps. So, any feedback on that and I also thought about, like this is a client that I have been seeing before and I already have a - she already has a therapeutic connection to me, but just the strength of that avoidance, I really thought, "Wow this is a client that already has some therapeutic connection to me. What if this was somebody I'd just seen?" and this is like the third time I've actually, or fourth time, like that avoidance was really strong so even some tips on maybe how to work on that better. (Transcript 1, p. 2) preceded by the relaying of relevant information about the case, the example below Similar to the segment above, in which the clinician's request for help was

illustrated further that case conceptualization is often followed by asking for help. In this interaction, the clinician updated the group members on what transpired in the most recent session, and then asked for advice about how to engage in Socratic questioning with the client:

Clinician: [CASE CONCEPTUALIZATION] ... I'd say that one of the main positives is that this patient has been really very good at following through, this session, number three, he turned in all six ABC sheets. He really has nailed down the distinction between thoughts and feelings - I didn't have to deal with anything. There was only one correction, in terms of the columns, where he had under column A, something that should have been under B, but other than that. He got the ABC distinctions down perfectly, he turned in six sheets, [and] two of them were on the trauma. His PCL scores are not changing one iota, - they vary between about 75 to 80, but I guess I wouldn't expect them to come down by this point. Consultant: That's right. Clinician: He does obviously need a lot of work on the bottom two questions of the ABC sheet. So I guess the good news is I do not really have to do any work in teaching him the distinction between thoughts and feelings, which is a pleasant surprise. [ASKING FOR HELP] What I'm finding, though, is that I guess I need some assistance or suggestions on Socratic questioning because internally, I find myself getting sucked in and sharing his overaccommodations. He is so articulate in what he is writing down, that I'm kind of sharing the over-accommodations with him. So I'm struggling to get in this Socratic questioning because when I read what he has down, some of the time I'm going, internally, yeah, I guess I would think the same thing. (Transcript 10, p. 2-3) 91

giving advice, which functioned together to help clinicians consolidate knowledge. In the excerpt below, the consultant engaged in Information-Based Teaching by reviewing the purpose of the impact statement, and then Giving Advice about how the use of these tools seemed to facilitate knowledge consolidation.

Another common combination of tools is information-based teaching and

to use the impact statement most effectively when working with the client. Together, [INFORMATION-BASED TEACHING]: The way that we talk about, in the impact statement, your beliefs changing, we talk about before and after the traumatic event. So before you thought this way, after you thought that way. Well, when you're an infant or a baby, you don't have schemas. You have maybe a couple of schemas but you don't have a lot. [GIVING ADVICE]: And so one of the things you might want to think about, as you're working with her, is instead of saying how are your beliefs changed or your belief about yourself changed, is you can say how are your beliefs about yourself and others in the world formed because of this experience. And so how did she build her understanding of this. And then, retrospectively, what did she tell herself about how something like this could happen. What you're probably going to get is, instead of self-blame, you're going to get a great deal of otherblame, of questioning the goodness of the world. You can still work on that. And then the problem is that it's going to have been confirmed with some other traumatic events. And so what you're going to want to help her do is realize that she also may be kind of, what I call connecting the dots, which is this bad thing happened, this bad thing happened, this bad thing happened, therefore the world is bad. But then you miss all the other data that said the world was good because you only connected the negative events to come to your conclusion, versus taking in all the data. So you've connected the dots between just the bad things and then got your result. So that's conceptually how I would anticipate you're going to need to work with her. (Transcript 7, p. 16-17)

together to facilitate knowledge consolidation, the order in which they were used

Although giving advice and information-based teaching were commonly used

Giving Advice, in the following example, Giving Advice preceded Information-Based Teaching. Specifically, the consultant gave the clinician advice about how to 92

varied. Unlike the example above, in which Information-Based Teaching preceded

approach a particular situation, and then reviewed content that was covered in the workshop: [GIVING ADVICE] Use it as an opportunity to address your stuck point. Try to understand what the nature of the emotion is that the person is feeling in the nightmare because, maybe, you can teach them about the kind of emotions they are having, perhaps, that they are worried about having or acknowledging that they are having with regard to this event. And then, I'll add just one more thing on this, the images in the event. The images in the event can give you some clues about aspects of the trauma that are particularly troubling, traumatizing that, in the light of day (inaudible) to talk through as they are focusing on. So, both might need some processing of natural emotions but also, maybe, some (inaudible)...[INFORMATION-BASED TEACHING] But that's precisely one of the reasons why we have these strategies that we teach and practice before we do this trauma processing. Do you remember that in your training? They did that biological model and they showed that little picture of the brain - that very abstract depiction of the brain and the cognitive therapy approach about re-gauging their cortical brain areas and keep them awake and active when they talk about the trauma. Because, in PTSD, what happens often is you - at least, what the biology tells us is that stress hormone deregulation (inaudible) cells in the cortical brain area lose their ability to function. And in adapting, the emotions just run amuck. They get to rule the roost. (Transcript 12, p. 18) In addition to the commonly occurring combination of information-based

teaching and giving advice, several elements of consultation were frequently used Instruction, and the Provision of Feedback were frequently used to enhance case

alongside case conceptualization. Specifically, Directive Instruction, Non-Directive conceptualization. In the following example, the consultant offered advice regarding

what to focus on in response to the clinician's relaying of the client's stuck points and what they covered in session:

Clinician: ...[CASE CONCEPTUALIZATION] in session three you introduce the ABC worksheets and I try to introduce those worksheets to work with some of what I perceive to be stuck points around his mother's death, but that's where I say on the fly I did decide okay assimilated versus accommodating. What I do know clearly is that he feels it's his fault that she died and that he can't be trusted to make (inaudible). I mean, I was able to challenge some of them like, "I cannot be trusted to make the right decision." I was able to 93

challenge that one to some degree but he goes, "No it was my fault that she died." So, I kind of hope to take a shot working on these, and also to buy myself some time to talk to you today.

Consultant: Sure, and I think that you can definitely have time to get to both of them. So, [GIVING ADVICE] I would stick with the idea that you really do want to focus in a primary session on the index trauma, and the index trauma is the one that is the most closely linked to the PTSD. (Transcript 20, p. 11) to something she heard the clinician relay when the clinician described what occurred in the most recent session: In the following example, the consultant employed a Correction in response

Clinician: [CASE CONCEPTUALIZATION] This just happened recently - he actually didn't do the homework, hadn't read the materials; my sense was he really didn't understand, and I didn't pick that up at the end of the session that he really was not comprehending what the next part was about. It was on the safety module. So I felt I needed to go back to that and review the content about safety and reassign that. I did try to work with him in the session to kind of walk through... Consultant: Reassign what, the module? Clinician: Yeah, the module. I did try to walk through what he should have done in the homework, in terms of picking a safety issue to work on a challenging beliefs worksheet with. He hadn't done any of those; he'd been away on a camping trip with other people from his OSI support group. I tried to work through a safety issue with him and it felt to me like he really didn't have the concept, so I spent that session Consultant: The concept of safety, or the concept of the challenging belief worksheet? Clinician: Actually, both. He's still struggling a bit with the whole worksheet, but he's much improved on that. In terms of safety, for self and for others, it may be a function of he gets quite inflexible in his thinking so he grabs on to an issue and that's where he goes. Actually, he was more in trust. I said, oh, this is the trust module here.

Consultant: Let me back up a little bit and explain the last five sessions. [CORRECTION] I would actually encourage you not to, at any point in the protocol, but particularly at the end, there isn't necessarily, given how it can work, a reason to repeat a session. In fact, whenever you break the protocol, which repeating a session is considered breaking the protocol, because it's 94

her advice about how to proceed.

In the following example, the consultant praised the clinician and then gave

not built in to repeat them, per say, one of the costs of breaking that protocol is that you lose that benefit of the structure that keeps them moving forward and is always working against that avoidance. (Transcript 14, p. 4-5)

[PRAISE] That's really wonderful. That's nice (inaudible). So, it sounds like you have a really solid grasp of how to address and deal with these modules. [GIVING ADVICE] I might ask him if he feels that the reading, and the reassignment of the reading of the materials, the patient materials as part of the protocol is burdensome or beneficial. Explore it and encourage him to read it. But if you are covering the materials satisfactorily, and it sounds like you are, in the session, then I wouldn't dwell on it. (Transcript 12, p. 25) Finally, an essential component of the model of consultation is thought to be

its two hypothesized mechanisms: reflection and connectedness. These

consultation and facilitate the overarching functions of consultation, namely

mechanisms are processes that seem to operate at numerous points during

knowledge consolidation and case conceptualization. Some elements of consultation supports reflection when they employ the following elements of consultation: issues that you'd like to discuss this session?" [Transcript 16, p. 4]); Inviting

may be especially likely to foster reflection. Consultants seem to foster a culture that Asking if Clinicians Have Questions (e.g., "Then what might be your questions or Participation or Reflection (e.g., "What might you do, and how much more would

you do to get the patient in touch with her feelings? Either one, [Name X] or [Name Y]" [Transcript 16, p. 7]); and Socratic Questioning (e.g., "How could you check out that?" [Transcript 16, p. 7]). Additionally, consultants seemed to encourage and find out if there's a stuck point and what that stuck point it? How would you do clinicians to reflect when they shared a personal experience. For example, in the 95

following excerpt, the clinician's response to the consultant's Sharing a Personal Experience suggested she was reflecting on what the consultant had shared: Consultant: Sometimes I've had folks have ideas that put them at first, they think "Oh hell, it's going to happen anyways, it doesn't make a difference what I do."

Clinician: And isn't that about regulating the fear though that they can't...like isn't that sort of one of the distractions from either the fear or something else possibly? (Transcript 9, p. 7) have her do some breathing exercises?" [Transcript 11, p. 20]), and Asking for Help (e.g., "I'd like your thoughts on that" [Transcript 20, p. 14]) are both elements of consultation that seemed to exemplify that clinicians were engaged in reflection. consultation. For example, when consultants imparted information, engaged in collaborative case conceptualization, gave advice, or modeled behaviour, they Finally, Asking a Factual Question (e.g., "Would it be outside the model to

good understanding...and I think with more sessions, like you said, all the nuts and

bolts will become more second nature" [Transcript 27, p. 20]"), and Validation (e.g., "...what you did is fine too, and you do have the best of both worlds because he was able to work on it on his own" [Transcript 29, p. 6]). As well, in the example below

the consultant drew on an experience that was familiar to many clinicians. Sharing a

96

Personal Experience seemed to foster feelings of connectedness between consultants and clinicians: ...to me this always reminds me a little bit of when you first ask people about suicidal ideation, and people think, "Oh, I don't want to ask about that because I might create it, you know, they wouldn't have thought of it before, but from my experience people know what they think and what they don't think, and if you think, "Okay I can't trust anyone," me asking you, "Can you trust anyone?" isn't going to make you go, "Well maybe I shouldn't," just like if I didn't think it was my fault, then someone asking me, "Do you think it was your fault?", I'm not going to change my mind just from somebody asking me the question. (Transcript 29, p. 6) By providing emotional support to clinicians who were learning the therapy,

and describing their own experiences delivering the therapy, the consultants created opportunities for closeness with the clinicians. This seemed to foster feelings of connectedness. Objective 1c

During this consultation call, the consultant fostered [INVITING PARTICIPATION OR REFLECTION] "Does anyone have any other many opportunities for reflection (Mechanism 1). For example, the consultant asked, thoughts in terms of choosing that index event and that kind of switch from what she had originally thought to what she's going with?" (Transcript 8, p. 5), and [SOCRACTIC QUESTIONING] "How would you say that to a client? I mean, in this

situation, how would you guide her through that?" (Transcript 8, p. 8), and [ASKING IF CLINICIANS HAVE QUESTIONS] "Any other questions or concerns about session two coming up, or anything else?" (Transcript 8, p. 17). The second CMO configuration posits that bringing case material (Context)

clinicians were punctual (Context 3). This provided ample opportunities for

clinicians to reflect (Mechanism 1). Consultants fostered reflection (Mechanism 1) by asking questions such as [ASKING IF CLINICIANS HAVE QUESTIONS], "So, any questions for the call, [Name X]?" (Transcript 23, p. 2). The consultant also encouraged reflection (Mechanism 1) through her use of Socratic Questioning:

Objective 2 The second aim of this study was to compare the model of clinical

consultation developed in this dissertation to the model of clinical supervision put forth by Milne and colleagues (2008). Research conducted in both the areas of clinical supervision and consultation has been impeded by poor conceptualization of what these educational processes include and how they work. These models shared the underlying aim of constructing an empirically based model that can be tested. A key similarity between the model of supervision put forth by Milne and

colleagues (2008) and the model of consultation put forth in this dissertation was 103

Twenty-six different supervision interventions were reported in the model of clinical supervision put forth by Milne and colleagues (2008). The comparison between this model and the model of clinical consultation put forth in this dissertation includes the supervision interventions that occurred in upwards of 25% of articles included in the review. The following supervision interventions occurred in 25% or more of the articles: teaching and instruction (75%), use of corrective feedback (63%), live or video-based observation (42%), goal-setting (38%), question-andanswer methods (38%), modeling (29%), planning (25%), and reinforcement/praise/support (25%). The following interventions occurred in fewer than 25% of the articles reviewed: discussion (21%), prompts (21%), role-play (21%), review/reflection (21%), explanation (17%), monitoring (17%), summarizing (17%), challenging (13%), listening (8%), problem-solving (8%), rehearsal of skills (8%), self-disclosure (13%), and five other interventions that each appeared once among the articles reviewed.

This led to significant differences in the nature of information gleaned from the studies and the language used to describe the studies' findings. For example, the model of supervision was simultaneously more comprehensive, yet more general, while the model of consultation was simultaneously more specific, yet more limited in scope. 108

Experiential learning is a particular type of learning, and it has been defined as "learning through reflection on doing" (Felicia, 2011, p. 1003). Kolb posits that the following four stages: experiencing, reflecting, conceptualizing, and effective learning occurs when the individual passes through a cycle that includes experimenting. This model emphasizes the critical role of active learning in several disciplines. Learning is defined as "the process whereby knowledge is

objectives of this dissertation was to consider whether Kolb's theory of experiential learning applied to the learning that occurs during consultation, and whether the first finding was that consultation on its own did not fit with Kolb's model of experiential learning. This is because a key component of the theory is "Experiencing". However, the combination of delivering the therapy and activities of consultation could be categorized according to these same stages.

Discussion Research has supported the integral role of clinical consultation as a strategy

for helping clinicians become proficient in the delivery of evidence-based therapies (e.g., Beidas et al., 2012; Edmunds et al., 2013a). Despite the widely acknowledged importance of consultation, little is known about the essential elements of consultation (e.g., Edmunds et al., 2013a; Nadeem et al., 2013a.), and there is no existing theory positing how it works. Researchers have identified the pressing typically entails (e.g., Herschell et al., 2010; Rakovshik & McManus, 2010), and need to deepen our understanding of consultation by describing what consultation identifying the mechanisms through which it works (e.g., Nadeem et al., 2013a). To address this gap in the literature, this study involved developing an explanatory model of clinical consultation and discussing it in light of the existing literature. clinical consultation. This involved describing the content and function of the

Haynes, Smith, Dysthe, & Ludvigsen, 2012). Therapists who were interviewed about consultant feedback, and in some cases wanted more of it (Beidas et al., 2013). This bolsters this study's finding that the provision of feedback was essential, and likely contributed directly to clinicians' development of proficiency. It is noteworthy that

the majority of direct feedback provided to clinicians in our sample was delivered as praise. Although identified as an important element of consultation, correction was one of the elements used the least frequently. Perhaps because the clinicians who received consultation were already licensed, they were experienced in remaining adherent to a therapy protocol. Accordingly, it is likely that they generally

conducted treatment in a manner that was consistent with the protocol and sought advice as needed. Perhaps in a sample of novice clinicians, supervisors would use correction more frequently. In addition to efforts to identify the elements of consultation, researchers

have tried to elucidate its mechanisms (e.g., Beidas et al., 2013; Edmunds et al.,

2013b). One set of findings has led researchers to propose that connectedness may Consistent with this research, which presents connectedness as a hypothesized mechanism of consultation, participants in the study conducted by Beidas and be the most important ingredient in successful consultation (Beidas et el., 2013b).

colleagues (2013b) described various activities of consultation and how they could help generate feelings of connectedness. Therapists expressed a preference for activities they viewed as authentic, and authenticity was identified as being a

facilitator of connectedness. In particular, therapists valued discussion about real 116

cases. Discussion of authentic case material occurred regularly during the consultation calls that informed the development of the proposed model. Additionally, consultants' sharing of personal experiences created opportunities for authenticity and connectedness. Therefore, failing to bring cases to consultation may have undermined this process, since it limited the opportunities for connection

His experiential learning cycle has been used as an explanatory framework for the outcomes of framework to the learning that occurs in consultation as well (Edmunds et al., therapist ongoing skill development more generally (Bennett-Levy, Thwaites, Chaddock, & Davis, 2009).

Name of code Clinician joins late

Definition -Clinician is not present at beginning of call, but joins call once discussion is underway

Contextual Factors When to use -When clinician joins more than a few minutes into the call, or misses considerable content -Clinician has not yet begun working with a client, or has not seen a client since the last consultation call, and therefore does not have case material to discuss

Appendix B

Clinician does not have content to discuss

-Clinician is present on call, but does not have any questions to ask, or case material to present

When not to use -When clinician is not present at very beginning of call, but joins while the consultant is taking attendance, or has not missed considerable content by the time he or she joins the call -Clinician asks questions, or brings case material to discuss

Example E: Oh, it looks like we've got somebody. Hi, who joined?

-Clinician does not have any questions

C: I have nothing new this week because I'm seeing my clients every second week and they are both on the week coming up. I talked about my clients last week and I don't have anything new.

129

Only one clinician on call Technological disruptions

-When multiple clinicians are absent from the call, and only one clinician is present -Technological malfunction during a call -Common examples include: difficulty logging into the server, difficulty hearing, call cutting in and out, call is dropped repeatedly, and portions of of audio recording is inaudible

-If call begins with one clinician on, and another joins mid-way through the call so the majority of the call has more than one clinician

E: It looks like you are the only one on the call. E: That sounds fine. (Transcriptionist's note: Inaudible, recording blip). (Several respondents advise that they are having difficulty hearing the expert).

130

Draft Name of code Agenda setting

Primary Elements of Consultation Definition When to use When not to use -Organizing time -Code should only be -When expert does not applied to expert delineate topics for call -Deciding what the call speech in advance, but segues will be used for from one topic to the next ("Setting/ -Captures a list of items maintaining structure" -Discussion of what clinicians would like help to be discussed on the would likely apply) with or have questions call about -Agenda is set near the beginning of the call

Appendix C

Examples Example #1 E: So, we should set an agenda for today's conversation. If each one of you could give me a brief couple of minutes...how many patients you have got and what sessions you are in with that patient, what is going on with the PCL and any questions that you might have that you would like us to address. Just make it brief. We'll get into the weeds once we get started, just so I have a sense of what we need to talk about today. Of course, let me know

131

if there is anything urgent.

Asking if clinicians have questions

-Asking if anyone has questions

-The solicitation of questions can be very specific or more general

-Code should only be applied to expert speech

Example #2 E: Then, X, we'll let you volunteer first. And then, we'll go from there and try to touch base with everyone. Go ahead, X. Example #1 E: Any other issues come up for you in session one or two that would be helpful for me to review? Example #2 E: Do you have any specific questions?

Asking for help/ advice/ guidance/ feedback

-Asking expert if she has advice or suggestions on how to approach a situation or deal with a particular issue -Seeking guidance in a

-Code should only be applied to clinician speech

-Question pertains to case formulation, conceptual issues, or 132

-When seeking facts or information ("Posing a fact-based question" would likely apply)

Example #1 C: The other issue is assistance with dealing with people with very high anger and a new gentleman I have,

direct or indirect manner -Making one's needs or questions apparent, obvious, or known

what action to take with a client -Includes asking for feedback on whether the consultant would have handled something the same way

-Think about as being parallel to the sort of information captured by the "experiential-based teaching" code Attendance -Taking role call

-Identifying who is on the call

-A statement about who is on the call, who is going to join the call, or who is absent but is expected to be on the call

-Code can be applied to either expert or clinician speech, or a combination

Example #2 C: And, do I get him to do that as his homework again, or would I get him to do that right in session? -If a clinician joins later Example #1 in the call this should be E: I do have all your captured with the names, so let me contextual factor just check to see "Clinician joins late" who is all on the call. Uh, I see on left hand side it looks like X, are you here? C: Yes I am, hello. E: And X? C: Hi.

I've had him for two or three sessions now and he just flat out says, "Look, I am black and white. There is no grey about anything."

133

E: Hi. And X? C: Yes. Good morning. E: Okay, and that's all that's showing. I'm not seeing X or X. Are they on and I'm just not seeing them? C: No I haven't heard them. Example #2 E: Who is on so far? C2: Hi, X. It's X.

C1: Um, well I am X. Case conceptualization -Providing background information about a client and his/ her trauma -Code can be applied to either expert or clinician speech, a conversation between an expert and a clinician, or several group members Example #1 C: I saw the other patient with the motorcycle accident today and we did session six and we spent a large portion of the

-Describing the course of treatment

134

-Conceptualizing what is going on for the client in terms of the CPT theory -Describing how various elements of the case are connected

-Discussing the client's key cognitions, behaviours, or environmental factors that the clinician ought to target in session

-Clinician can offer information related to the case voluntarily, or in response to questions posed by expert or other clinicians

session going over her challenging questions worksheets. So, she did quite a good job with that. We did need to make some of the stuck points more specific to challenge them so I didn't write them down, we wrote right on her sheet. For example the stuck point was "I should be over this by now" and so we ended up kind of making that a little bit more specific in when she was saying that she was saying "I should be 100% over this by now, physically and emotionally." So that sort of what's related to the evidence that she'd come up with and

135

some of her evidence for and against was...

Example #2 E: For her the stuck points aren't necessarily that she didn't do something right. For her the stuck points, even the assimilated stuck points may be the reason why this went this way because I could never depend on anyone. So it's almost like another blame instead of the self-blame. The "I can't depend on people to do what they should be doing to support me" and that may or may not be realistic but worth checking out. I suspect that they 136

Clarification

-Seeking to confirm understanding; to elucidate, remove ambiguity or doubt; to clear of confusion or uncertainty

-Code can be applied to either expert or clinician speech, a conversation between an expert and a clinician, or several group members -Consultants seek clarification about a clinician's actions or understanding

probably are people around that can support her but she's so confident that she may preclude them from doing that. -Essence of the Example #1 statement should not be E: So I just want to about providing a clarify, you started rationale or explanation giving a PCL, you started saying session three but you actually did three and fourth.

-Clinicians seek clarification by sharing their understanding and asking the consultant to clarify or correct them as needed -When it is apparent that the intent is to clarify 137

C: Yeah I did three and four. So, um...yeah okay but I also gave you the PCL for session two. Example #2 C: So, you're asking about the scores for the tools? E: The PTSD symptoms, yes. How are the PTSD

Correction

-Highlighting something that the clinician did that was incorrect

-Pointing out an error (in understanding, conceptualization, execution etc.)

-Code should only be applied to expert speech

symptoms? -An error in the client's Example #1 thinking would likely be E: There was one captured under "Case stuck point that you presentation/ mentioned, "It's formulation" ideal to have several contingency plans." I'm not sure if that's a stuck point because it probably is ideal... Example #2 C: X, I'm only seeing my clients every second week or so.

E: Ooh, that's not good. That encourages a lot of avoidance. We actually don't have any research that that's a good idea. Is there a way you could possibly get this person either in to see you every week or if they literally can't come 138

Discussion about study

-Discussion about study logistics, policies etc.

-Code can be applied to either expert or clinician speech, a conversation between an expert and a clinician, or several group members -Common examples include clinicians posing questions related to study logistics, and expert describing how processes differ between clinical practice and the study

in because of money, do the second week by phone? Example #1 E: I am not sure what the decision has been for this study...So what I might do is e-mail X because he is the one taking care of all the logistics and can probably let you know.

Example #2 C: I have started the study with one client who has a PTSD diagnosis. And we met two times to prepare him for the study. We are meeting for the third time today where were are starting the consent forms and into steps.

139

Encouragement

-Feeling or expectation that something specific is likely to occur -To give confidence or hope about the therapy going forward, or about the progress they can expect to make learning the treatment

-Code should only be applied to expert speech -Future-oriented

-When discussion is focused on something that was well-done, "Praise" would likely apply

Example #1 E: It's kind of one of those things where it's daunting when you start and it becomes very different once you know those components.

Experiential-based teaching

-Subjective or personal knowledge gained in the role of clinician, expert,

-Code should only be applied to expert speech 140

-When it includes explicit instructions of what a clinician should

Example #2 I definitely think X that you've got a good understanding and the fact that we're having this kind of discussion at this point, this is just coming up with additional ideas but I do get the sense and I think with more sessions like you said, all the nuts and bolts will become more second nature. Example #1 E: I had a client yesterday in my

or trainer

-Ideas, insights, or suggestions that are not found in the CPT manual -Helpful tips, or the "tricks of the trade"

do, the "Giving advice" -Must apply to one of code applies the following situations: expert's work as a clinician, insights/observations from attending trainings, working with other skilled clinicians, or being a CPT consultant and having observed other trainees learning to deliver CPT -Should be applied when it refers to a specific example, case, story, or anecdote, or an explanation of the expert's usual practice

office who told me he drives a tow truck for a living and he likes that job because he doesn't have to be around people, he can just drive around in his truck and interact very seldomly with maybe more than one person at a time and I asked him, Have you always been like that and he said no. So you see this is what we were kind of talking and trying to instill motivation and for him he was able to recognize he didn't use to be so isolated, he didn't use to want to avoid people. Example #2 E: I have worked with patients who

141

Giving advice

-The imparting of instructions, recommendations, guidance, or suggestions for how to proceed -The giving of advice typically results in steps or actions for the

-Code should only be applied to expert speech

-Can be specific to the case being discussed, or can be more general advice about how to handle particular types 142

clearly understand that it is not their fault. And yet, the avoidance for these kinds of reasons that you have listed, in terms of stuck points...the avoidance is powerful enough that they don't get an opportunity to really digest the experience to the extent that they don't have to be experiencing the hyperarousal that just never gets a chance to settle down. Example #1 E: One of the things that I might recommend is setting an agenda with her at the beginning... Example #2

clinician to take

of clients, situations, issues etc.

Information-based teaching

-Imparting information related to PTSD (e.g., symptoms, PCL scores) or CPT (e.g., elements of the protocol, information about the protocol, or the

-Code should only be applied to expert speech

-The content that is being communicated is 143

-If the expert draws on her own experience to illustrate a point, the "Experiential-based teaching" code should be used

E: Definitely you're going to stay trauma focused and work on those stuck points that are related to kind of how he's remembering that trauma before you reach into those overaccommodated ones which it sounds like he's kind of told you to do the overaccommodated ones but we really want to make sure that we're spending enough time on the memory, on the past, the assimilated ones. Example #1 E: Just to kind of review session one, the clients aren't really getting to say much of anything. If

theory underlying CPT)

-Offering an explanation, rationale, or reasoning

available elsewhere/ is verifiable (e.g., in the CPT manual, in research papers, in training materials etc.)

you're getting any kind of stuck points in session one, that's great you are already ahead of the game. Really there's not a whole lot of information you're getting besides just beginning to build rapport, helping them see hope, you know, instilling some maybe understanding of the rationale so you can get some motivation. In session two, it really starts to get more information from the client but not in terms of challenging. At this point in session two all we're really doing is trying to understand the struck points.

144

Inviting

-Instructions,

-Code should only be 145

Example #2 E: There is a different cut-off depending on the population. Usually, if it's about 50 on the PCL, likely, the person has PTSD. But a person can have a very high score on the PCL but not have PTSD. And that's the same for the interview that the CAP ... the clinician administered PTSD symptoms scale, which is an interview. They can have a very high score on that and not have PTSD. They can have a low score and have PTSD. So, PTSD is the array of symptoms that is in the DSM. -When the invitation for Example #1

participation/reflection recommendations, guidance, or suggestions for how to proceed -Being directive -Advice from an expert would typically result in steps or actions for the clinician to take

applied to expert speech

participation is connected to setting an agenda the "Agenda setting" code is applied

-This could be specific to the case, or more general advice about how to handle particular types of clients, situations, issues, etc.

-When the invitation for participation pertains to figuring out which clinicians are going to present, then the "Setting/ maintaining structure" code is applied -When the invitation for participation occurs in the context of eliciting more details about the client/case, the "Case presentation/ formulation" code is applied

E: So that's just kind of some thoughts about that. What do you all think? Example #2 E: X, did you have any thoughts that you wanted to add into this conversation about X's case?

Modeling

-Expert offers a clinician a suggestion for what to say suggestions for what to say. -Consultant does a demonstration

-Code should only be applied to expert speech

-Typically can be identified with the use of quotation marks

Example #1 E: What I might say is something like, "Okay so today we're going to review what you did and I'm wanna take a look at your

146

-Can be identified when the expert gives the clinician exact wording to say to a client -Since modeling is usually in the service of advice giving, when a segment consists mostly of wording for the clinician to use, the "Modeling" code is applied

Posing a fact-based question

-Querying about something defined, particular, or fact-based -Seeking specific information

-Code should only be applied to clinician speech -Questions can be posed in a direct or indirect manner -This code can be thought of as being 147

-Typically closed-ended

Example #2 E: One of the ways that I get people to that is I'll say, "Well, is this a change from how you were before?" -Intention should not be Example #1 to clarify C: I'm just ("Clarification" would wondering if you likely apply) can remind me what a stuck point -If questions pertain to would sound like if study logistics, apply it was an "Discussion related to assimilated one the study" versus an accommodated one Example #2

ABC sheet...I'll look at your ABC sheet, but I also need to make sure we spend some time, probably the last ten or fifteen minutes talking about your next assignments."

parallel to the "information-based teaching" code in that the answers to these questions could probably be found in the manual or other CPT training materials Praise -Expression of the sentiment "good job" or "nicely done" -Identifying something the clinician did well -An expression of approval or admiration -Code should only be applied to expert speech -When the expert is commenting on the clinician's work -When the expert is commenting on the client's progress in therapy

C: Uh, X, a question. If there is more than one trauma, is this where you would say, If there is other trauma accounts go ahead and write those out as well and bring them in?

-The statement simultaneously refers to the clinician and the client, or the statement refers to the client's progress that is obviously connected to the clinician's work

Example #1 E: You guys have got some really impressive stuck points I'm noticing as I'm hearing almost all the stuck points that all three of you brought up and talked about really sound well worded. Example #2 E: I think it sounds like you're on the right track. Everything you've said today makes

148

Structure

-Leading or directing the flow of the call -Segueing from one topic/person to another -Making sure one clinician does not monopolize the call and/or that all issues raised by clinicians get addressed -Technique used by expert to encourage clinician to reflect on a concept, central idea, application of the protocol, or the way they do things

-Code should only be applied to expert speech

-Can include giving instructions about how to present cases -Can occur at any point in the call

-When a list of items to discuss on the call is laid out at the beginning of the call, "Agenda setting" would likely apply

me feel like you have a pretty good sense about where you're going with this and the protocol.

Example #1 E: I can address that a little bit as well. Thank you for that. And that brings us to X. Example #2 E: Thank you so much. Who would like to go next?

Socratic questioning

-Code can be applied to either expert or clinician speech, a conversation between an expert and a clinician, or several group members

-Questions pertaining to factual information (e.g., "What session are you on?" or "What is your client's index trauma"? do not meet requirements for "Socratic questioning" code

Example #1 E: And, so folks, what do you think the stuck point might actually be...? Example #2 E: X or X, what do you think about how to help somebody?

149

Validation

-To confirm someone's perspective, decisions, or experience -Expert takes the perspective that what clinician thought or did makes sense or is ok

-Code should only be applied to expert speech

Example #1 E: I can understand that because I know we talked a lot about trying to format those stuck points and that can be time consuming Example #2 E: I have had that gentleman and I had him Tuesday at 2pm, so I can identify with that experience.
