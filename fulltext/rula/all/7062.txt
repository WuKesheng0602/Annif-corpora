ABSTRACT 
  Thermal and Optical Performance of Granular Aerogel Glazing after Accelerated Ageing  Master of Building Science, 2017  Vadim Novik,   Graduate Program in Building Science, Ryerson University      The glazing portion of a window has dual but conflicting functions where it is required to provide views  to the outside, but also have good thermal resistance. Glazing is usually one of the weak points in the  thermal envelope and tends to age quicker and to a higher severity. The combination of granular  aerogel inside a glazing cavity is still relatively new product, but could offer both great thermal and  optical performance. Currently available durability data for granular aerogel glazing is scarce.  Accelerated ageing was used to generate real life equivalent stresses of 13.574 years by exposing a set  of samples to several climatic conditions. The center of glass Uvalue increased by a maximum of 4%  after accelerated ageing in the oven and the temperature cycling machine. A maximum reduction of  211% was measured in the visible transmittance after accelerated ageing climatic and humidity  chambers.

1 INTRODUCTION 
  Global warming can be considered as one of the biggest challenges of the twenty first century which  manifests itself in warmer temperatures of the oceans and earth's atmosphere. An increase of an  average of 0.8Â°C of the earth's surface temperature has occurred primarily in the last three decades.  Two main reasons for global warming can be attributed to human based activities of burning of fossil  fuels and deforestation. During the 21st century, climate model projections indicate a 1.12.9Â°C and 2.4 6.4Â°C increase for the global surface temperature for best and worst case scenarios respectively.  Based on these prediction, some places around the world have started to adopt a low carbon strategies  by taking the appropriate measures (Koebel, Rigacci, & Achard, 2012). Increasing public awareness on  carbon footprint has grown in the last several years to show the correlation between CO2 concentrations  and global climate. Stabilizing the atmospheric CO2 concentration below the 500ppm has been outlined  as a point of great importance in many instances.  Increased international political efforts continually act as a strong stimulus for research on high  performance insulating materials and systems to meet the ever increasing energy standards. The  primary goals for the research is to examine the thermal performance of up and coming materials while  improving conventional ones. Improving the energy management of buildings through the coupling of  high performance envelopes with renewables would be the method to help stabilize greenhouse gases  concentrations in the atmosphere. At the end of the 20th century, the European Union has accepted the  KyotoProtocol which mandated the decrease of emissions by 20% by the year 2020 compared to the  emissions level of 1990, and although this a great start, a low carbon economy through net zero/positive building is the way of the future.   

1.1 Background 
  As the 21st century rolled in, there was an undeniable necessity for the world to check its energy  consumption distribution by sector. In 1999, the total consumption of energy in Europe was reported at  1780 million tons of oil equivalent of which 35% was consumed by the commercial and residential  sectors (Cuce, Cuce, Wood , & Riffat , 2014). Buildings have a major impact on greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions in developed countries being responsible for more than 30% of the GHG emission in 2005  (Baetens, Jelle, Gustavsen, & Grynning, 2010) (Baetens, Jelle, & Gustavsen, 2011).   In order to minimize the energy consumption, adding insulation (or more of it) to the building envelope  can yield savings in energy consumption which directly reduces emissions. Conventional insulation  materials have to be used in multiple and/or thicker layers to achieve the prescribed levels which results  in heavier construction, more complex building details and reduced area of inhabitable living space  (Aegerter, Leventis, & Koebel, 2011). There is also the notion that using air as an insulator has reached  its limit (Cuce et al., 2014). With each passing year, the need to have a high performance insulation  material which meet the energy requirements is becoming greater and greater. 

1   

There are currently several materials/products in the market which aim to meet the growing demand  for high performance insulation. Although aerogel was first discovered in the 1930's (Kistler, 1931)  (Kistler & Caldwell, 1932) it has undergone great progress in the last two decades. Aerogel attracted  many sectors due to its wide range of applications some of which include construction, automotive,  electronics, aerospace, marine, oil & gas and clothing among others. Due to its exceptional physical and  chemical properties aerogel has generated a lot of interest for energy efficient retrofitting and high  performance buildings.  The market share of aerogels tripled to $83 million in 2008 and reached USD $352.6 million in 2014  (Grand View Research, 2016a). Since aerogel's beginnings, the super insulator (materials with thermal  conductivity <0.02 W/mK) has become a significant player in the USD $44.46 billion (as of 2015) global  insulation market (Grand View Research, 2016b). Commercializing aerogel is still difficult due to  manufacturing process but research and development continues to reduce cost, create new types of  aerogel and enhance the performance.    

1.2 Objective and Research Motivation 
  Although aerogel has been already extensively researched and has very attractive performance  characteristics, there is still work remaining to be done in terms of reducing the production cost of the  material to make it more commercially viable. Regardless of when this breakthrough will come, and  whether it will be sudden or gradual, like with any new product seeking to enter the construction  industry, its durability must be proven in order to gain and maintain widespread application. Producing  aerogel on a commercial scale is a business with a desire to earn a profit, and using an untested product  would be risky, so in order for it to be more marketable to the construction industry, it needs to show its  reliability and durability via accelerated climate ageing.  The issue of durability is always a concern for all parties involved in construction and operation of a  building. Even if the product has superior qualities on paper, if it performs worse in low temperatures  when compared to conventional batt insulation, it would be difficult to convince owners to use it. In the  case of insulated glazing units (IGUs), even the best performing window is worthless when the IGU is  unable to perform well after a few years of service (e.g. fogging or freezing during cold weather).    Aerogel has many applications in the construction industry. Ageing aerogel inside IGUs, as a  replacement for the gas fill, would allow for a better understanding on how aerogel based glazing would  perform in 1520 years from now by evaluating its thermal and optical performance. This will either help  prove its durability or will expose the weak points which will require modification to the design. It is  important to get a better understanding on how an aerogel filled IGU would perform in the future from  a thermal and optical point of view to either provide guidance for current and future product  manufacturers or to halt the entire notion of using aerogel in IGUs.    The following questions can be derived from the research objective:   How do the prototype granular aerogel filled glazing units perform in terms of thermal  conductance and visible transmittance after accelerated climatic ageing? 

2   

  

Which accelerated climatic ageing mechanisms are the most damaging for granular aerogel  inside glazing units? 

1.3 Scope of Work and Limitations 
  The scope of the research is to determine how ageing effects granular aerogel inside a glazing cavity.  The experiments and data collection have been carried out within the constraints of the building science  laboratory and time tables. It also important to note that testing of the aged aerogel was focused on  thermal and optical performance while other aspects such as sound dampening and moisture  management were not tested.   The assembly conditions were monitored and held within the recommended range but could not be  perfectly controlled due to the allocation of the given assembly area. The created specimen were  dependent on the availability of the base components; spacer, glass, sealant and aerogel as well as the  ability to assemble them with relative success. The assembled IGUs may not represent best practices in  terms of assembly technique or materials selection but rather an effective method to contain the  granular aerogel within an IGU assembly to allow for accelerated ageing.

2 BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE REVIEW 
 

2.1 Overview 
  High performance insulation or superinsulation is a term used to describe materials which have a  thermal conductivity lower than 0.020 W/mK. Thermal conductivity () is an inherent property of a  material which allows it to conduct heat (Dorcheh & Abbasi, 2008). Metal are known to be very good  conductors as can be seen in their application in electronics with their  being tens to hundreds of  W/mK. Glass, sand and other minerals have single digit thermal conductivities. Common insulation  materials such as glass wool, mineral wool, expanded and extruded polystyrene have conductivities in  the range of 0.0300.040 W/mk. Polyurethane and phenolic raisins are considered as transition  materials between superinsulation and conventional insulation (Aegerter, Leventis, & Koebel, 2011).   Some of the current superinsulation materials include aerogels, vacuum insulation panels (VIPs) and  vacuum glazing all offer very low thermal conductivities. There are three types of aerogels, silica, carbon  and alumina. Among the three, silica is the most common, with most research and biggest adaptation. In  the recent years, research is focused on cost reduction and the creation of new aerogels (Cuce et al.,  2014).   

2.2 What is Aerogel? 
  Aerogels were first discovered in 1931 by Samuel Stephens Kistler (Kistler, 1931) (Kistler & Caldwell,  1932) and have been in constant development ever since. The term aerogel comes from the fact that it  is manufactured from gels. At the same time, the term aerogel might be misleading since it is dry and  rigid in its final form (also known as the solid air). One of the main characteristics that makes aerogel so  extraordinary is the combination of extremely high porosity (8099.8%) and translucent structure  (HÃ¼sing & Schubert, 1998) (Gaponik, Herrmann, & EychmÃ¼ller, 2012).  Aerogels are essentially the solid framework isolated from it its liquid medium. It consists of crosslinked  internal structure of silica chains with large number of air filled pores (Baetens, Jelle, & Gustavsen,  2011). This can be achieved by replacing the liquid in the pores with a gas using supercritical drying (now  possible under ambient drying conditions) with little shrinkage (<15%). Xerogels are similar to aerogels  and are dried by evaporation but experience extreme shrinkage (>90%). CryogelÂ® is a commercialized  name of a product developed by Aspen Aerogel. It is a flexible composite aerogel blanket (with a built in  vapour retarder) used for insulating in low temperature environments, ranging from ambient to  cryogenic. Aerogel is the generic umbrella name similar to rock wool and fiberglass insulations.   

2.3 Synthesis 
 

4   

The synthesis of silica aerogel can be divided into three main stages; the preparation of the gel (solgel  process), ageing of the aerogel and drying the gel under a specific set of conditions. In material science  the solgel process is known as the method which is used to produce a solid material from small  molecules. This method is used to fabricate metal oxides, especially from silicon and titanium. This  process covers the conversion of monomers into a colloidal solution (sol) which acts as the precursor for  an integrated network (gel).   

2.3.1 Gel preparation (solgel process) 
  The gel preparation, also called the solgel process is the procedure where solid nanoparticles dispersed  in a liquid agglomerate to form a continuous three dimensional network throughout the liquid. This  process is outlined in great detail by (Brinker & Scherer, 1990). In silica aerogels, the nanoparticles are  grown directly in the liquid. Precursors are the starting substances which are used in the growth of the  aerogel within the liquid solution.   Some of the more common precursors for silica aerogels are silicon alkoxides which include the  following: Tetramethoxysilane Si(OCH3)4 also known as TMOS, tetraethoxysilane Si(OC2H5)4 also known  as TEOS and polyethoxydisiloxane or PEDSPx. PEDSPx can be obtained by reacting TEOS with  substoichiometric quantity of water in an acidic alcoholic medium.    From a thermal insulation point of view, the aerogel monoliths created with PEDS and TMOS have lower  thermal conductivities than that of TEOS monoliths (Wagh et al., 1999) but TEOS could potentially have  better optical properties (Tewari, Lofftus, & Hunt, 1986). Too much water in the solution will yield low  porosity gels which requires the use of solvents such as ethanol.   The hydrolysis of silicon alkoxides is done with a catalyst, either acid, base catalysis or twostep catalysis  (Venkateswara Rao & Bhagat, 2004). In order for the sol to become gel, the solid nanoparticles in the  liquid need to collide with one another. For some types of nanoparticles this is done more easily since  they contain reactive surface grounds that allow them to stick together after colliding by electrostatic  forces or bonding while other types require additional additive. Using acid for hydrolysis and  condensation results in linear (or weak) chains and a microporous structure in silica sols but with long  gelation periods (Kirkbir, Meyers, Murata, & Sarkar, 1996). On the other hand, using a base (e.g. NH4OH)  allows for the creation of a more uniform particles which lead to a broader distribution of large pores  which is less desirable for thermal insulation materials (Siouffi, 2003).  One of the main precursors for silica aerogels is alkoxides which are described as expensive and  hazardous substances (can cause blindness with TMOS) which would prohibit mass production. One  solution is to use water glass or sodium silicate as a cheaper raw material for the silica (Schwertfeger,  Frank, & Schmidt, 1998). It is currently used as a precursor for commercial aerogel synthesis. This is  done by acidification of the aqueous sodium silicate solution with HCI or H2SO4 to create silica hydrogel  (United States Patent No. 5811031  Method for the subcritical drying of aerogels , 1998) (United States  Patent No. 5647962  Process for the preparation of xerogels , 1997).

2.3.2 Ageing of the gel 
  When sol reaches the gel point, the silica network is occupying the entire container, but the delicate  structure still contains unreacted alkoxide groups. In order to strengthen the silica network, a sufficient  amount of time must be given for hydrolysis and condensation to continue. This process can be  enhanced by controlling the pH levels, concentration and the solution (HÃ¦reid, Einarsrud, Lima, &  Dahle, 1995) (HÃ¦reid, Nilsen, & Einarsrud, 1996) (Palantavida, et al., 2006).   Two different mechanisms could affect the structure of the gel, dissolution of small particles into larger  ones and transport of materials to the neck region. One of the common ageing procedures utilizes an  ethanolsiloxane mixture which adds new monomers to the solid silicon monoxide network, increasing  the degree of cross linking (HÃ¦reid et al., 1996). The resulting gel has higher strength and stiffness. This  ageing process is controlled and although the transport of the material is unaffected by mixing or  convection due to the solid network, the diffusion on the other hand is affected. This means that the  thicker the gel, the longer each process step will take which limits the practical production of aerogels.  After ageing and before drying, the liquid inside the pores needs to be removed. This can be done with  relative ease by washing the gel with ethanol and heptanes (HÃ¦reid et al., 1996). Any leftover liquid  would not be removed by supercritical drying which would lead to a very dense and opaque aerogel.   

2.3.3 Drying of the gel 
  The final and most critical step is drying the gel. Due to the size of the pores, the drying process is  dominated by capillary pressure (except in supercritical drying and freeze drying) which causes shrinking  and potential fractures. The drying process can be sorted into two types; ambient pressure drying (APD)  where the capillary tension is present and supercritical drying (SCD) where the liquid in the pores is  removed above the critical temperature and pressure to elude capillary tension. This step in aerogel  production is where a lot of cost of the aerogel comes from and has potential for cost reduction. Also,  the shrinking of the aerogel plays a role in the production cost since with less shrinking the aerogel slabs  would be better suited for glazing applications.     2.3.3.1 Supercritical Drying (SCD)  For silica aerogels, the supercritical drying (SCD) is the most commonly used method. Under SCD there  are two common methods; high temperature supercritical drying (HTSCD) (Kistler, 1932) and low  temperature drying incorporating carbon dioxide (LTSCD) also known as the Hunt Process (Tewari,  Lofftus, & Hunt, 1985). HTSCD is not relevant as a method for drying aerogels for building applications  but is mentioned for completeness.  The first step for HTSCD is placing the aged gel into in an autoclave which is filled with a solvent. The  device is closed and heated slowly to reach past the solvent's critical temperature and pressure (Lide,  1996). For the second step, the resulting fluid is isothermally depressurized at ambient pressure to reach  room temperature. For silica aerogels, methanol is commonly used as the solvent liquid for HTSCD (Lide,  6   

1996) which makes the aerogel partially hydrophobic and generally produces higher quality silica  aerogels.  For LTSCD the aged gel is placed in the autoclave and is filled with the saver (nonflammable liquid  carbon dioxide). Once the solvent in the pores is replaced, the autoclave is heated to 313K. Next the  fluid is isothermally depressurized until it reaches ambient pressure at which point the autoclave is  cooled to room temperature. Aerogel dried using this method experiences shrinkage due to the  replacement of the original solvent with CO2. HTSCD was found to be the best method to minimize the  shrinkage of the gel during the drying process (Baetens, Jelle, & Gustavsen, 2011). It should be noted  that the chemical durability of aerogel decreases when liquid CO2 is used as a solvent in LTSCD (Brinker  & Scherer, 1990).    2.3.3.2 Ambient Pressure Drying (APD)  Drying the gel in ambient pressure is of high interest due to the possibility of simplifying the process  thus reducing the cost and making aerogel more commercially viable. Ambient Pressure Drying (APD) is  carried out in two steps. The first step is silylation of all the OH groups takes place in order to prevent  the absorption of water which results from the formation of the hydrophobic aerogel. This is done by  replacing the present solvent with a waterfree solvent along with a silylating agent which allows the H  from the OH group to be replaced with an alkyl (Kricheldorf, 1996).   For the second stage, the drying is carried out by ambient pressure evaporation (Brinker & Scherer,  1990) and consists of three parts. At first there is an initial warming period followed by the second part  which is the first drying cycle. This is characterized by the balance of the volume loss of the gel and that  of the evaporated liquid all the while free water continuously moves to the exterior surface via capillary  forces. The third part is the second drying cycle (also known as the falling rate period) which is  dominated by diffusive vapour transport allowing the liquid to escape slowly to the exterior.    2.3.3.3 Freeze Drying  Using this method allows the frozen (solid) pore liquid to change directly into vapour in vacuum  (Mathieu, et al., 1997) (Klvana, Chaouki, RepellinLacroix, & Pajonk, 1989) (Pajonk, 1989). One of the  drawbacks of this method is the long ageing period that is needed in order to stabilize the gel network.  In addition to that, the solvent must be replaced with a different one that has a lower expansion  coefficient and high sublimation pressure.   

2.4 Material Properties 
  The reason why silica aerogels have high potential is due to their unusual solid material properties. The  almost skeletal in nature crosslinked internal structure of silicon dioxide chains has a large number of  air filled cavities. The pores in aerogel are very small and range from 10100 nm (Zeng, Hunt, Greif, &  Cao, 1994) for pure aerogel and 570 nm for silica aerogels depending on the purity and fabrication 

7   

method (van Bommel, van Miltenburg, & den Engelsen, 1997). These pores can take up anywhere from  85 to 99.8% of the total aerogel volume (Baetens, Jelle, & Gustavsen, 2011).   The high porosity is a direct result from the extraordinary pore sizes which allows the aerogel to achieve  its outstanding physical, thermal, acoustic and optical properties in combination with a very low  mechanical strength. Aerogels are some of the lightest solid materials known at this time with a bulk  density of 3 kg/m3 while the skeleton's density is 2200 kg/m3 (density of air is 1.2 kg/m3) (Hunt, Cao, &  Jantzen, 1991). Aerogels for building applications have a bulk density around 70150 kg/m3 (Baetens,  Jelle, & Gustavsen, 2011). Apparent or bulk density is the mass of many particles of the given material  divided by the total volume they occupy. This volume includes the internal pore volume, interparticle  void volume and the particle volume itself.  Silica aerogels also exhibit high compression strength (up to 300 kPa), but have very low tensile strength  which makes it brittle. The aerogel has to undergo a process in order to be made hydrophobic as to  prevent collapse of structure when in contact with water due to surface tension in the pores (Jensen,  Schultz, & Kristiansen, 2004). A very effective combination is the combination of aerogel in a vacuum  which reduces the thermal conductivity even further and also limited the ingress of moisture. The weak  tensile strength can be alleviated by incorporating fiber matrix until a better solution is found.   

2.4.1 Thermal Properties 
  Aerogels have very low thermal conductivity (Kistler & Caldwell, 1932) which results from low  conductivity through the silica skeleton, low gaseous conductivity through the pores and low radiative  infrared transmission (Ramakrishnan, et al., 2007). Finding the total thermal conductivity using the  summation of the individual ones is not appropriate since they are heavily interconnected, e.g. changes  in the infrared absorbance will also change the solid skeleton conductivity.  Thermal conductivity of the solid silica is quite high but it only accounts for small portion in aerogels. In  addition, the skeletal structure has many dead ends which results in a tortuous path for thermal  transport. The low gaseous thermal conductivity of aerogels can be explained by the Knudsen effect  where the gaseous conduction is expressed as function of the air pressure and the pore size (Kennard,  1938). Aerogels have low pore size and high porosity and as a result, the gaseous thermal conductivity  will have a large influence on the overall conductivity.   At ambient conditions, the Knudsen effect is responsible for the low thermal conductivity. The gaseous  thermal conductivity can be further reduced by filling the aerogel with a noble gas (has lower  conductivity and commonly used in IGU construction), keeping the aerogel in a vacuum or reducing the  maximum pore size. Applying a pressure of 5 kPa or less without any other alteration can yield an overall  thermal conductivity as low as 0.008 W/mK (Hunt, Cao, & Jantzen, 1991) (Smith, Maskara, & Boes, 1998)  (Wong, Perera, & Eames, 2007).  Silica aerogels are reasonably transparent in the infrared spectrum (Baetens R. , Jelle, Gustavsen, &  Grynning, 2010). Heat gain via radiation would become a dominant factor in high temperatures (i.e.  200Â°C) but is not a cause for concern at low temperatures. The effects of radiative transfer can be  reduced by adding an additional component such as carbon black (can be done before or after the  8   

drying) which can either absorb or scatter infrared radiation. Using this method the thermal conductivity  can reach 0.0135 W/mK at ambient pressure or 0.004 W/mK at 5 kPa (Baetens, Jelle, & Gustavsen,  2011). Stateoftheart commercially available aerogel insulation for building application has a thermal  conductivity in the range of 0.01310.0136 W/mK at ambient temperature with very little increase until  200Â°C.     2.4.1.1 Aerogel Variations  There are other types/variations of aerogels that are manufactured from different materials with  potentially attractive properties. The feasibility of creating polyisocyanurate (PIR) and polyurethane  (PUR) based aerogel was investigated by (Biesmans, Randall, Francais, & Perrut, 1998). These aerogels  had a density of 80400 kg/m3 and were analyzed as a function of pressure. The produced samples  showed that it was possible to produce aerogels with a thermal conductivity of 0.007 W/mK below  pressure of 1 kPa and an air filled value of 0.022 W/mK with a density of 150 kg/m3 (typical bulk density  between 70150 kg/m3 for building applications).   Another type of aerogel which was based on polyurea had thermal conductivities measured at various  conditions, ranging from ambient pressure to 0.13 kPa and from room temperature to 120Â°C (under  pressure of 1.07 kPa) (Lee, Gould, & Rhine, 2009). The polyurea aerogel samples had high porosities, low  thermal conductivity values, hydrophobicity, somewhat high thermal decomposition temperature  (270Â°C), low degassing and produced less dust than silica aerogels. It is interesting to note that this  aerogel excelled in low temperatures with the conductivity decreasing from 0.005 W/mK at 20Â°C to  0.002 W/mK at 120Â°C which would be useful for industrial applications but also for cold climates.   

2.4.2 Optical Properties 
  Aerogels are not fully transparent like glass is but they allow light through diffusion which gives them  the flexibility to be used in glazing applications. Aerogels have high transmittance of radiation in the  visible light spectrum (radiation with wavelength of 380780nm). Monolithic aerogel has much better  light transmittance with solar transmittance of TSOL=0.88 (Reim, et al., 2004). Heat treating of aerogels  can yield an increase in their transparency up to 6% (Jensen, Schultz, & Kristiansen, 2004). If the best  optical properties are desired, it is possible to select the most optimal synthesis parameters during the  solgel process (Ramakrishnan, et al., 2007).   The light transmitted through aerogel appears to be slightly red while reflected light has a bluish tint.  These observations can be explained by bulk (or Rayleigh) scattering and by exterior surface scattering  (Baetens, Jelle, & Gustavsen, 2011). Rayleigh scattering is caused by the interaction of light with  inhomogeneities in gases, liquids or solids. A good example of these particles is dust in the atmosphere  and they become more effective when their size is closer to that of the wavelength of the incident light.  The presence of the pores in aerogels acts as scattering centers and the efficiency of the scattering is  depends on the size as well as the wavelength of the radiation since different wavelengths will scatter  with different magnitudes. 

9   

In addition to transparency in the visible range, aerogels also have high transparency in the infrared  spectrum (TIR=0.85) (Baetens, Jelle, & Gustavsen, 2011). At higher temperatures, this transparency  increases the overall thermal conductivity of silica aerogels. If transparency is not desired (e.g. aerogel  that goes into insulation blankets or plaster), the transmission in the visible range can be reduced by  50% by adding a little isopropanol percent by volume or other similar opacifiers (Reichenauer, Manara,  Fricke, & Henkel, 2004).   

2.4.3 Fire and Safety Properties 
  Silica aerogels consist of SiO2 with a Â­CH3 treated surface giving it hydrophobic nature. These materials  are generally nonflammable and nonreactive. Silica aerogels have a very high melting point of 1200Â°C.  Commercial products that contain silica aerogels share the same properties. In some instances, aerogel  insulation is used as fire retarding material and if PET fibers were used as reinforcement then they  would be replaced.   

2.4.4 Health Implications 
  Aerogel insulation sheets produce dust. Most of the commercially available aerogel insulation products  consist of complete amorphous (0% crystalline) silica. Exposure limits sets by the US OSHA are in the  range of 5 mg/m3 for respirable dust. Synthetic amorphous silica is not classified a cancerogen (group 3)  to humans by the Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Studies on various animals have found that  amorphous silica can be completely removed from the lungs (BrÃ¼ning, et al., 2002) (Warheit, 2001). In  addition to that, epidemiological studies of works with long term exposures to synthetic silica found no  evidence of silicosis.  Some pollutants are released into the indoor environment which include chloride from tap water, NOx  and SOx from incomplete burning of gas, formalin from furniture and paints and VOCs from organic  solvents. Some allergies and respiratory problems such as asthma, intensify with airborne contaminants.  The conversion of these contaminants into nontoxic compounds is an effective method for their  removal (Riffat & Qiu, 2013). Some aerogel products such as Pristina have been utilized for the removal  of indoor air contaminants and for outdoor environment clean up (PristinaTM Aerogel Materials, n.d.).   

2.5 Building Applications of Aerogel 
  Although aerogel is still expensive, research and development continues to find cheaper variations that  maintain the performance but make it more economically attractive to use in the construction industry.  Aerogel can be broken down into two main categories; transparent monolithic aerogel and granular  aerogel based insulation (translucent or opaque). Aerogel can be used in buildings in the form of  insulation blankets as well as filling of the cavity in glazing assemblies. The usage of aerogel in glazing is  10   

primarily used for daylighting (e.g. skylights) control. Simple payback calculations indicate that the  payback period for aerogel ranged from 58 years for a discount rate of 10% (Wong, Perera, & Eames,  2007).   

2.5.1 Translucent Insulation Applications 
  Glazing can be considered as the most important part of most fenestrations partially due to the fact that  it generally has the biggest area of the constituent parts but it also serves contradicting functions.  Windows are responsible for up to 60% of the total energy loss in a building especially in highly glazed  ones (Buratti, Moretti, & Zinzi, 2017) (Gustavsen, Jelle, Arasteh, & Kohler, 2007). When calculating U value for windows, it is important to mention which method was used since there could be up to a 3%  difference between the North American (ASHRAE) and European (ISO) methods (Blanusa, et al., 2007).  The application of aerogels in glazing offers a potential to revolutionize windows allowing great thermal  performance combined with high light transmittance (Wong, Perera, & Eames, 2007). There has been a  substantial amount of conducted and ongoing research regarding the application of monolithic and  granular aerogel in high performance glazing. An important note to make is that when aerogel is  exposed to direct sunlight, scattering becomes very visible which could limit the application of aerogel  glazing to skylights or north facing windows. Aerogel based glazing systems have started to appear at  the marketplace around 2005 (Schultz & Jensen, 2008) (Rigacci, et al., 2004).  Granular based aerogel window was developed by ZAE Bayern (Germany) (Reim, et al., 2002) (Reim, et  al., 2004) (Reim, et al., 2005) (Wong, Perera, & Eames, 2007). Two types of granular were used in the  prototype windows; semitransparent spheres with solar transmittance of TSOL=0.53 (for 10mm  thickness) and highly translucent granulates with TSOL=0.88. The granules were packed in a 16mm wide  polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) double skin sheet between two air gaps (12 or 16mm), filled with  krypton or argon with glass on each side essentially created a triple glazed type configuration.  Several granular based aerogel prototype windows were created by (Buratti, Moretti, & Zinzi, 2017) with  two types of granular sizes to test thermal and optical performance and incorporate into building energy  simulations. The thermal transmittance was found to be between 1.01.1 W/m2K with 15mm cavity size  which is a 63% reduction in the Uvalue when compared to conventional windows along with a 30%  reduction in light transmittance. When lowe glass was used the Uvalue reduction was lower (31%) and  a more moderate reduction in light transmittance (10%) was observed with the larger granules. These  types of windows could be considered for new builds as well as retrofits but with marginal annual  heating energy savings (4%) and similar performance for cooling loads.  The HILIT+ project of the European Union developed a monolithic based aerogel window. The prototype  window used the aerogel with a high performance spacer and vacuum (0.11 kPa) to achieve an overall  heat loss coefficient Uwindow=0.66 W/m2K and TSOL=0.85+ for 13.5mm thickness. The noise reduction was  measured at 33dB (Jensen & Schultz, 2007). Increasing the thickness of the aerogel from 13.5 to 20mm  would increase the Uvalue to 0.5 W/m2K with the solar transmittance staying about 0.75 (Schultz &  Jensen, 2008). Replacing the triple glazed, argon filled windows with the prototype 13.5 and 20mm  windows, in a house built according to the Danish standard or the Passive House Standard in the Danish  11   

climate found energy savings of 19% and 34% respectively. By changing the triple glazed, argon filled  windows with aerogel glazing in a typical new built, detached single family house in climatic conditions  of Denmark, energy savings of 1180 kWh/year (19%) were observed (Schultz & Jensen, 2008).  Ambient drying process was developed in order to synthesize window glazing coated with silica aerogel  film (Kim & Hyun, 2003). The aerogel films were synthesized at the temperature 270Â°C and atmospheric  pressure. The transmittance of the glazing was over 90% which is 12% higher than that of an uncoated  glass slide. The thicker the layer of aerogel, the smaller the thermal conductivity became. Several  combination of aerogel and glass were used and all samples showed high solar and light transmittance.  As expected, due to the aerogel, the light was scattered which resulted in reduced optical quality.  At the University of Perugia, Buratti and Moretti have done some research pertaining to aerogel glazing  systems (Buratti & Moretti, 2012a) (Buratti & Moretti, 2012b) (Buratti & Moretti, 2011). The emphasis  of their work was focused on investigating the optical and thermal properties of aerogel based glazing  systems to determine their viability in building applications to produce energy savings. Both monolithic  and granular system were analyzed with the monolithic coming out on top with better light  transmittance of =0.62 (granular was =0.27) and a low Uvalue=0.60 W/m2K (in evacuated double  glazing). The granular systems had a 60% light reduction compared to the base double glazing with low e coating and a Uvalue=1 W/m2K for the same thickness (Buratti & Moretti, 2012b). The monolithic  aerogel glazing system allowed to obtain a thin system with Uvalues below 0.50 W/m2K (Duer &  Svendsen, 1998) without diminishing the solar factor or considerably reducing daylight transmittance.  The best thermal characteristic for aerogel configuration across multiple climate zones was found to be  the following assembly: 4mm outer clear glass, 15mm aerogel layer, 4mm inner clear glass (Wang, Wu,  Ding, Feng, & Wang, 2015). The study looked at five different climate zones in China (Harbin, Beijing,  Shanghai, Guangzhou and Kunming). The heat transfer coefficient for assembly #5 (mentioned above)  was 0.72 W/m2K and a shading coefficient of 0.59.   

2.5.2 Opaque Insulation Applications 
  An example of aerogel based insulation blanket was developed by Aspen Aerogels, Inc. (Northborough,  MA USA) called spaceloftÂ®. It is a flexible aerogel imbedded blanket available in 10mm thickness and has  a thermal conductivity of 0.013 W/mK at 0Â°C which is 22.5 times lower than traditional insulation  materials. The preparation process is quite interesting where the aerogel composite is prepared by  adding fibers or fibrous matrix to a pregel mixture which contains the gel precursors, after which the  gel is dried. Application for this type of product can be as continuous insulation for stud frame  construction and might be especially desirable for historic building that are being renovated since the  material is very thin and would save space (Kosny, Petrie, Yarbrough, & Childs, 2007).   This specific product is no longer in production but curiously can be bought online from various online  sellers (e.g. ebay) roughly between $255.55322.8/m2 ($2330/sf) as of late December 2016. The cost of  a conventional material for the same thermal resistance is about 10 times less. It is important to note  that the blankets are made from amorphous silica as opposed to crystalline silica reducing possible  health due to exposure.  12   

Another material developed for pipe insulation called NanogelÂ® Compression PackTM by Cabot Aerogel  (Massachusettes, USA) with thermal conductivity of 0.014 W/mK. The product gets "activated" at which  point it will expand to fill all the gaps. This product is aimed at deep water pipein pipe tieback  installations. Cabot Aerogel also offers bulk particles (P100/P200/P300) that can be mixed to create  boards, blankets and plasters.    

2.5.3 Comparison to other High Performance Materials and Systems 
  The direct competitor to aerogel windows are the triple (multilayer) glazed high performance windows  currently available on the market. The triple glazed windows are heavier, and require bigger and more  robust frames to support the thicker glazing assembly. A variation of the triple glazed windows which  has similar performance incorporates Suspended Coated Films (SCF) which replace the intermediate  glass panes with films. The usage of films allows for thinner frames with comparable Uvalue which  reduces the need for stronger frames as well as opening the door for retrofit projects. One of the  drawbacks of the suspended film glazing is a significant reduction in the Visible Transmittance (VT or  Tvis).   In gas filled IGUs, the increased thermal performance which is achieved through the use of coating and  films is tradeoff to the visible transmittance. There is no magic glazing which is able to provide both high  Tvis, low Uvalue and low solar heat gain. This idea is also carries through to granular aerogel glazing  where bigger granular size let in more light while smaller granular has better thermal performance. The  allure of the monolithic aerogel glazing is that it could have both great thermal and optical properties  and do it in a light and slim format. Table 1 shows the Uvalue for selected high performance triple  glazed and suspended film glazing products as well as prototype aerogel windows.

  Vacuum Insulated Glass (VIG) also known as evacuated glazing is another high performance glazing  system which was first conceived in 1913 by Zoller, but was not produced until 1989 (Eames, 2008). This  type of glazing consists of two lites of glass separated by an array of support pillars with vacuum in the  cavity. One of benefits of the vacuum glazing is the thinness, especially when compared to multilayer  glazing.  There are three different categories of smart windows defined by method of color change; liquid  crystals, suspended particle devices and (photo,thermo, and electro) chromic windows. They offer  high performance solutions through the ability to dynamically control Solar Factor (SF) and  transmittance properties depending on exterior conditions and/or interior requirements. Electrochromic  windows (ECWs) are the most reliable and promising among the three technologies (Baetens, Jelle, &  Gustavsen, 2010). The main advantage of the smart windows is the dynamic solar/transmittance  properties by the use of an external voltage control. There is an electrochromic foil that can be applied  to existing windows allowing for retrofit applications (ChromoGenics, n.d.). This technology can be  combined with suspended film glazing where the interior film is replaced with an electrochromic one for  even higher energy savings.   

2.6 Accelerated Ageing 
  Building products and systems have to fulfil many functions during their service life in a building by  possessing satisfactory durability with respect to various properties. Unfortunately, it is often that  products and systems are unable to satisfy the specified requirements after a relatively short period of  time. This results in increased maintenance, health and safety risks, extensive replacement and any  other possible consequential building damages throughout the building's lifecycle. Different products  15   

have different resistances versus various climate exposure factors. Therefore, it is important to select  building products and systems that have a proven and satisfactory longterm durability. This is done  with proper documentation by carrying out longterm natural outdoor climate exposure or by using  appropriate accelerated ageing in a laboratory.  Natural outdoor climate ageing takes a long period of time which makes it impractical for the majority of  building products. The answer to this issue is the use of accelerated ageing which is both faster and  more economical. It uses various climatic strains and acceleration factors to test the performance of a  given product at various targets. Although the climatic exposure factors can be broken down into  categories and tested separately, the total strain from a combination of factors could be substantially  larger than the added sum of the single exposure factors (Jelle, Accelerated climate ageing of building  materials, components and sturctures in the laboratory, 2012). The most severe strain depends on the  product itself as opposed to the climate exposure conditions.    

2.6.1 Accelerated ageing of IGUs 
  Durability of insulated glazing units (IGUs) is critical for building energy performance. Windows are  responsible for 3050% of the thermal transmission losses through the building envelope which makes  knowledge about durability important as it directly pertains to energy performance throughout the  entire service life of a building (Asphaug, Jelle, Gullbrekken, & UvslÃ¸kk, 2016). There is a range of  standards and research that has been carried out that specifically deals with accelerated ageing through  the form of durability certification for IGUs.   Glazing units are exposed to a diverse set of environmental factors such as wind and working loads,  solar radiation, temperature and atmospheric pressure fluctuations, water and water vapour. The vast  majority of contemporary double glazed units have a double seal which is fairly gastight and performers  better when compared to single seal. The amount of gas fill can vary in new units but it is usually around  90% in most cases (OlssonJonsson, 2005).  For conventional glazing, the durability primarily comes from its ability to prevent gas escape which is  almost exclusively determined by the low water vapour permeability of the primary seal (e.g.  polyisobutene (PIB)). The second seal's water vapour permeability is minor in comparison, but its tensile  and elastic recovery properties are what allows the primary seal to function well (Wolf, 1992) (Wolf &  Waters, 1993). Seal failure is the primary cause for loss of gas fill (e.g. argon, krypton or xenon) which  reduces the thermal resistance of the glazing unit.    

2.6.2 Accelerated ageing of aerogel 
  Although aerogel is nonflammable and could be considered stable in terms of ageing, water surface  tension could damage the nanoporous silica structure, reducing thermal performance (Jensen, Schultz,  & Kristiansen, 2004). Although the surface of aerogel is hydrophobic, the degradation could occur if  repeated moisture attacks cause breakage. This could be especially prevalent in aerogel glazing where  16   

the aerogel is sandwiched between two panes of glass with primary and secondary seals that are  designed to prevent moisture migration through the assembly. With time, due to the factors such as UV  radiation, pane movement and deterioration in seal adhesion, the cavity could experience  humidification and dehumidification cycling. Aerogel's hydrophobic surface (consists mostly of methyl  groups) can decompose under exposure to solar irradiation (primarily from shortwavelength 290370  nm) over time (Ihara, Jelle, Gao, & Gustavsen, 2015).   

2.6.3 Degradation Mechanisms and Configuration 
  The most common degradation mechanisms that are used for IGU accelerated ageing are temperature,  humidity and radiation. There are a few standards available that deal with accelerated ageing for  building products. One of the European standards used by Asphaug, et al, (Asphaug, Jelle, Gullbrekken,  & UvslÃ¸kk, 2016) to test the durability of glazing spacers for airtightness and their impact on energy  performance is the Nordtest Method (NT) Build 495. NT Build 495 provides the guidelines for  accelerated ageing in a vertical simulator for up to 490 days (490 x 24hr) which is sufficient for the vast  majority of accelerated ageing for glazing units.   Within the vertical climate simulator the samples are subjected to four different climatic conditions;  Ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) irradiation (black panel temperature of 63Â°C), water spray (0.015  m3/(m2 hr)), freezing (20Â°C) and ambient laboratory conditions. The UVA and UVB intensities were  averaged to 30 W/m2 and 3.4 W/m2. The duration time for each climatic condition is 1 hour. This type of  configuration allows to create a cumulative strain on the samples due to combination of ageing factors  which would be closest to real life strain.     2.6.3.1 Elevated temperatures  Using high temperature for accelerated ageing is quite common especially for polymers (e.g. sealants  and gaskets) which have an accepted safe range of about 6070Â°C. The selected temperature should be  high as possible to accelerate the temperature degradation as much as possible based on the Arrhenius  Equation (provides the exponential temperature dependence of chemical reaction rates) while staying  within the safe range. At the same time, the selected temperature should not be as high where it would  induce degradation which would not occur during natural ageing. Having higher temperature in  combination is an effective way to increase the rate of reaction and reduce ageing time.    2.6.3.2 Temperature cycling  Temperature cycling can cause large degradation due to the freezingthawing cycle (especially in  materials containing water) which would be subject to volume expansion at the macro and microscale.  This type of testing is crucial for products that are designed to be installed in colder climates where  there freezingthawing cycles can be frequent as well as large temperature differences between interior  and exterior. The temperature range used for freezethawing cycles by Asphaug, et al, (Asphaug, Jelle,  Gullbrekken, & UvslÃ¸kk, 2016) ranged between 20Â°C and ambient laboratory conditions. North 

17   

American standards such as ASTM E773 and E774 which are used to test and certify conventional IGUs  have a range of 2060Â°C as part of their cumulative strain ageing.     2.6.3.3 Solar radiation  Solar radiation is one of the main degradation mechanisms. The solar radiation at the earth's surface  ranges roughly between 280 and 3000nm: ultraviolet (UV) radiation has wavelengths below 400 nm,  while visible light (VIS) has a range of 380780 nm and infrared radiation (NIR) is between 7803000 nm.  The UV radiation range can be further broken down to UVA (315400 nm), UVB (280315 nm) and UVC  (100280 nm). Almost half of the energy can be found in the NIR range (Jelle, 2012).  Various building products (especially organic materials) may deteriorate as chemical bonds are broken  as a result from collision with higher energy particles (i.e. UV and shortwave VIS). Damage can range  from discoloration or loss of mechanical strength. The exact atomic composition and impurities  determine the energy needed to break chemical bonds. Generally with building materials it is best to  have durable and longlasting products. One crucial aspect of accelerated ageing in a laboratory is to  minimize changes or chemical reactions which would not occur under natural outdoor ageing process.  The choice of the light source is important since various lamps have energy peaks shifted to lower or  higher wavelengths. The Metal Halide (MH) lamps simulate the most accurate solar spectrum at the  earth's surface with Metal Halide Global (MHG) version being the best. Different types of lamps are  better suited for different types of ageing such as using xenon or MHG lamps for accelerated ageing of  photovoltaic solar cells while UV lamps are not used for this purpose.

  The vertical climatic chamber used by Asphaug, (Asphaug, Jelle, Gullbrekken, & UvslÃ¸kk, 2016) for IGU  ageing incorporated ultraviolet (UV) tubes and infrared (IR) irradiation (black panel temperature of  63Â°C). The UVA and UVB intensities were averaged to 30 W/m2 and 3.4 W/m2 respectively for the bulb  configuration used in the vertical climate simulator. Canvas samples were aged in the Atlas SC600 MHG  Solar Simulator which uses 2500W MHG lamps at an intensity of 1200 W/m2 but with physical metal grid  to reduce it by 50% for an effective irradiance of 600 W/m2 (Jelle, 2012).   The lamps specified by ASTM E77388 Seal Durability of Sealed Insulating Glass Units, section 6.2.2.2,  specify the use of F72T12BL/HO4 (85W) lamps with an intensity not less than 10 W/m2. A long wave  ultraviolet meter was used in direct contact with the lamp to measure irradiance. For the fogging test  outlined in this standard, it specified a 275W Type RS sunlamp with an intensity of 20 W/m2, tested  every 200 hours (UVA). IEA SHC Task 27 (Elmahdy, 2002) referenced ASTM E77388 and also specified  the use of F72T12BL/HO lamps but no specific irradiance. For the fogging test in the same report, it is  specified to use a UVA lamp with an output of 4 W/m2.  ASTM D789715 Laboratory Soiling and Weathering of Roofing Materials to Simulate Effects of Natural  Exposure on Solar Reflectance and Thermal Emittance (ASTM D789715) mentioned the use of UVA340  19   

lamps in section 6.3 (if an accelerating apparatus or a climatic chamber is used). ASTM G15416 outlines  multiple configurations of exposure conditions that provide combinations of lamp type, irradiance and  cycling. Typical irradiance levels range from 0.49 to 1.55 W/m2*nm with the UV portion of the cycle  lasting between 4 and 8 hours.  Aerogel granule ageing driven by moisture and solar radiation (Ihara, Jelle, Gao, & Gustavsen, 2015)  used Atlas SC 600 MHG (metal halide global lamps) with an irradiance of 1200 W/m2 in wavelength of  2003000 nm. The solar ageing cycle consisted of two step, 5 hours of radiation at 60Â°C and 50% relative  humidity followed by an hour long water spray at 10Â°C.

To evaluate the moisture ageing resistance, Ihara et al, (Ihara, Jelle, Gao, &  Gustavsen, 2015) used a thermal chamber (Atlas SC 600 MHG Solar Simulator) to exposure the aerogel  to moisture fluctuations. The aerogel was placed in glass trays with spacers to provide equal exposure to  each of the trays without lamp radiation. A container held 50 cm3 of water at bottom of the chamber  which was hermetically sealed. The temperature was kept mostly at 65Â°C except during the warm up  and cool off period (slightly over an hour combined) which was 35Â°C. The aerogel granules were  exposed to a constant saturated relative humidity for roughly 300 cycles (3 months). When aerogel  granules are exposed to humidity cycling, the granules experience repeated stress due to the surface  tension of the water. The accumulated fatigue damage which is defined by Miner's Law can be the main  ageing factor.  The climatic chamber used by Asphaug, et al, (Asphaug, Jelle, Gullbrekken, & UvslÃ¸kk, 2016) had a water  spray installed which provided 0.015 m3/(m2 hr).

The humidity chamber used  for seal edge durability by (Elmahdy, 2002) cycles between 60Â±3Â°C and 95Â±5Â°C.     2.6.3.5 Cycling and samples  The number of samples needed can vary depending on what is being testing and to what level of  accuracy it needs to comply. In the case of Asphaug, et al, (Asphaug, Jelle, Gullbrekken, & UvslÃ¸kk,  2016), 18 samples were divided into three groups with six samples in each group with a different set of  ageing mechanisms employed. The first group was placed in the vertical climate simulator for the entire  duration, the samples are exposed to each climatic condition for one hour every cycle. The second group  was placed also in the vertical climate simulator but only for the first two weeks after which it was  moved to a heating chamber. The third group was placed directly into the heating chamber for the  entire duration. All IGUs were vertically placed in both the climatic chamber and the heating chamber.  For seal durability testing (Elmahdy, 2002), the testing lasted for 3 months (105 days). Six units are  selected and placed in the high humidity chamber for 14 days. The same six units were then placed in  the weather cycle chamber for 63 days. The units were mounted with one side exposed to ambient  laboratory conditions while the other side is exposed to weather cycles to simulate real life  configurations. Each cycle lasted for 6 hours. For the first hour the temperature is decreased to 29Â±3Â°C  and then it is maintained at that temperature for another 1 hour. In the following 1 hour the heat is  turned on allowing the temperature to reach room temperature. Next, the UV lamps are turned on for 1  hour to reach a temperature of 60Â±3Â°C. At the beginning of the same time period the water mist is  turned on to reach a minimum of 90% RH and turned off at the end of the hour. In the fifth cycle our,  both the temperature and UV exposure is maintained. During the last hour of the cycle, the temperature  is gradually reduced to room temperature while the UV is on and is only shut off at the end of the cycle.

3 METHODOLOGY 
  To get a better understanding of the durability for granular aerogel glazing a series of accelerated ageing  tests were conducted to simulate equivalent real life strain in a short period of time. Glazing serve  multiple roles in building facades by providing view, daylight, thermal resistance and protection from  the elements. As such, IGUs are exposed to outdoor conditions that range from extreme cold to high  temperatures in combination with fluctuating indoor temperatures as well. The selected apparatuses  represent the most common, severe real life stresses on the IGUs.  The oven was used to simulate sustained high temperature while the temperature cycling machine  fluctuated from high temperature to very low to create freeze thawing cycles. The humidity chamber  created a warm and moist environment to generate high vapor drive. While most of these apparatuses  created more isolated ageing conditions, the climatic chamber was used to create a full array of  conditions including high relative humidity, UV radiation, high temperature and condensation to  simulate the effects of cumulative strain.  The IGU components which were selected had several criteria to meet. The component had to  compliment the expected real life performance, meaning that a super spacer with low Uvalue was  selected since aerogel glazing is usually picked for its high performance. Clear, low iron glass was chosen  to provide the best optical performance. The ability to assemble the IGU without professional  equipment was again facilitated by the easy cutting super spacer as well as the sealant which came in a  tube and was used with caulking gun. Two types of granular aerogels were used as the cavity fill to check  the extent of accelerated ageing on granular size in relation to performance.  The focus of this research was on the thermal and optical performance of the granular aerogel IGUs. As  such, two testing apparatuses were used for testing, the heat flow meter (HFM) and  spectrophotometer. The spectrophotometer supports up to 12x12cm unit sizes but using this size inside  of the HFM would mean that the center of glass value would be skewed due to the proximity of the  sensor (diameter is 10cm) to the edge. Based on this information, two sizes were created to provide  more accurate measurements, a smaller size for the spectrophotometer 10x10cm and a larger size for  the HFM 30x30cm.   Glazing has contradicting roles which make it a crucial item in a window assembly. Glazing certification  and performance tests are similar to accelerated ageing tests designed to evaluate the ability of a design  and manufacturing to provide the expected life time durability. Aerogel glazing is relatively new with  limited commercial products partially due to its novelty and unfamiliarity. Durability data for aerogel  glazing is quite limited since currently the main focus is commercialization via cost reduction and  optimization of pristine performance. These aspects are crucial in the widespread adaptation of a new  product or system but for long term market share, durability is key.   

3.1 Experimental Setup 
3.1.1 Glazing Unit Assembly 
  22   

There are many types of glazing currently on the market. They range from double glazed, triple glazed,  quad glazing with films, various lowe coatings and gas fills. In order to isolate the aerogel, other  variables in the glazing assembly had to be eliminated or minimized as much as possible. At the most  basic level, double glazed unit with low iron clear glass, spacer and double seal would the most suitable.  This type of assembly eliminates unnecessary components and complexity allowing the aerogel to be  the variable factor (no coatings or gas fills) that impacts the performance the most.   

3.1.2 Components Selection 
  The selected components were chosen to reflect a compatible assembly in terms of expected  performance, ease of assembly and to improve performance measurements. Lowiron glass was  selected due to its high clarity which gives the ability to evaluate any discoloration of the aerogel if any  were to occur after the ageing process as well as maximum light transmission. Two sizes of glass were  ordered, 10x10 cm and 30x30cm from CANADA GLASS & MIRROR co. at a thickness of 6mm. A thickness  of 3 or 4mm would have been preferable but was not available at the time, and in order to expedite the  process the thicker glass was deemed appropriate enough.   An edge spacer separates and provides for a uniform distance to be maintained between two lites of  glass. The most common spacer is made from aluminum and is usually filled with desiccant to absorb  any moisture that infiltrates inside of the assembly. Aluminum spacers are highly conductive but for the  purpose of this testing it would have not been an issue, but they do require special tools to cut them to  size as well as additional corner pieces.   Super SpacerÂ® by Edgetech (Quanex) is a flexible, high performance warm edge spacer with a thermal  conductivity of 0.159 W/mK (C . R. Laurence of Canada, n.d.). It is made from structural silicone foam,  filled with desiccant (47% by weight) with preapplied side adhesives. It comes in roles of 20.1m (66ft)  and can be cut to size with either a hand notcher or any sharp knife (Figure 11). This allows for custom  sizes and easy assembly even for layperson without prior knowledge of IGU assembly. The selected size  is a gray 13mm (0.5") with a 6.4mm (1/4") thickness. The combination of this spacer and two lites of  6mm glass formed an IGU with 25mm (1") thickness (for both sizes).   This type of spacer has a low Uvalue (0.2 W/m2K) which helps maintain the high performance nature of  the IGU around the edge where in the past it has suffered from highly conductive aluminum spacers,  thus poor performance. Commercially available granular aerogel glazing systems also incorporate the  use of high performance spacer making the selection in line with industry standard. Aside from the ease  of use and great thermal performance, this spacer is also very durable with good resistance to UV  radiation and temperature performance (40 to 121Â°C). These two properties indicate that the likelihood  of the spacer failing during the accelerated ageing would be low, making the IGUs sturdy and durable for  the duration of the ageing and testing. The spacer also features a vapour retarding backing, together  with the acrylic adhesive forming the primary seal.   The spacer is designed to be used in conjunction with conventional IGU sealants such as hot melt butyl  which is used in glazing assembly facilities. The alternative to these sealants that can be used in smaller  quantities of glazing that are not assembled in a factory is silicone foam sealant (C. R. Laurence of  23   

Canada, n.d.), together with the spacer is distributed by C. R. Laurence of Canada. The sealant comes in  standard 305 ml tubes that fits into a 10 oz. caulking gun. This sealant is a single component urethane  sealant that has a special lowsolvent formulation that makes it compatible with Super SpacerÂ®  adsorbent and does not require a polyisobutylene primary seal. This sealant has a shelf life of 12 months  from the date of manufacturing and should be used roughly within that period to guarantee  performance. One sealant tube is good for approximately 2 small (10x10cm) and 2 large units (30x30cm)  which is equivalent to linear length of 32cm (12.6").

Figure 4  Airglass (box 150 SE24522) granular aerogel 

  Two types of granular aerogel were used in the assembly of IGUs. The first type of aerogel is  manufactured by Cabot Corporation located in Boston, Massachusetts, USA  (http://www.cabotcorp.com/solutions/productsplus/aerogel/particles). They specialize in servicing  industries such as transportation, infrastructure, environment and consumers with products such  as rubber, specialty carbons, cesium formate brines, activated carbon, aerogel, fine cesium chemicals,  graphenes and more. The P300 aerogel (Figure 3) is part of a family of similar aerogels with the primary  difference being the granular size. The P100 and P200 granules have particles sizes of 0.014mm and  0.011.2mm respectively. The entire lineup has a pore diameter of 20nm and porosity greater than 90%.  The surface area of the granular is in the range of 600800m2/g and is hydrophobic in nature. The  particle density is between 120150g/m3 while bulk density is 6585kg/m3 for the P300 line (and 80100  kg/m3 for P100 and 7595 kg/m3 for P200).  The second type of granular aerogel used is manufactured by Airglass Inc based in Sweden  (http://www.designinsite.dk/htmsider/r3300.htm). This is the same company that has manufactured  the monolithic aerogel for the European HILIT+ project in the early 2000's. As can be seen from Figure 4,  this type of aerogel is akin more to a monolithic slab that was shattered/crushed as opposed to particle  type aerogel that Cabot provides. This type of aerogel creates more irregular fills and voids within the  IGU cavity which would could vary the thermal and optical properties a little more when compared to  Cabot P300.   

3.1.3 IGU Assembly 
  24   

A total of 9 IGUs were assembled in two different sizes, five 10x10cm and four 30x30cm. The glazing  units were assembled in groups for efficient use of materials. The first unit to be assembled was a clear  10x10 (unit 1) in order to get familiar with the spacer and application of the sealant. The sealant got  quite messy during application process which meant that the following units were masked with tape on  the exposed faces in order to prevent the need to use a razor blade to clean it off and risk damaging the  surfaces. Tooling the sealant with a concave device is needed, but after creating a mess with no benefit  to adhesion or fill consistency caused by unit 1, tooling was not used on the following units. Although  tooling is required to ensure proper application of sealant in real life glazing, for the purposes of this  research, as long as the aerogel stays sandwiched between the two glass lites, that is sufficient for  proper testing.  The next batch of units were unit 2 (Cabot P300 Aerogel 10x10cm), 3 (clear 30x30cm) and 4 (Cabot P300  Aerogel 10x10cm). Unit 2 and 4 were filled horizontally without any compaction so after sealing of the  unit, it was noticeable that there was a large air gap (bigger for the 30x30 unit), see Figure 7 and Figure  8. P300 granule ranges in the size of 1.24mm in diameter which makes it quite small and must be  compacted in order to have properly filled IGU as was also noted in (Gao, Jelle, Ihara, & Gustavsen,  2014). The next set of units (59) was done shortly after as single batch.   Unit 57 are the smaller 10x10cm size but they are filled with Airglass 150 aerogel as opposed to Cabot  P300 (Figure 7). This type of granular aerogel has "chunks" of aerogel of highly varied sizes which  creates a slightly less diffused and a little more translucent lighting effect (Figure 9). The remaining units,  8 and 9, were filled with Cabot P300 but this time were compacted in the horizontal position before  placing the second glass lite and sealing the IGU (Figure 8). Unit 8 can be considered to have a "perfect"  fill while unit 9 has a little too much aerogel. It would have been ideal to have two "perfect" fill units but  the overfill in unit 9 is not a major issue since the IGU is still dimensionally stable and the aerogel is  contained. The larger units with Cabot P300 aerogel show larger gaps, area percentage, when compared  to the small units that are filled with the same aerogel.

  The assembly of all the units was done using a makeshift assembly table (Figure 10 and Figure 11). All  the units were assembled in ambient room temperature (1822Â°C) and relative humidity (3646%). Once  the spacer (and aerogel if it was used) were applied, the second lite was placed and to ensure good  adhesion, the IGU was placed under a weight (roughly 8kg) for a minimum period of 30 minutes. After  that the units were sealed using the sealant mentioned in section 3.1.2 and left to cure in the same  room. The sealant depth for all the IGUs is 4.76mm (3/16") with a height of 12.7mm (1/2") which  requires 24hrs to cure at 25Â°C and 50% RH according to the manufacturer. Since the room conditions did  not match to those that the manufacturer used, as well as the daily fluctuation, all the units were left to  cure for 48hrs+. The final step was to remove all the masking (painter's masking tape and newspaper) as  well as trim the excess sealant for it to be flush with the glass surface.

3.2 Accelerated Ageing 
  Accelerated ageing is used to test product durability in smaller time frame when compared to natural  outdoor testing. This gives the researches or manufacturer the ability to estimate the service life span  28   

for a given product and identify the mechanisms that might cause premature failures and either modify  the design or application instructions. There are multiple ways to age a product and it predominantly  depends on what the end goal is for the given product. During the execution of accelerated ageing it is  important to not cause any changes or chemical reactions in materials or products which would not  occur during natural outdoor ageing. It is also important to accelerate only the processes which take  place during outdoor climate ageing (e.g. too much UVB radiation which would cause chemical reactions  that would not occur during regular ageing).   To have an accurate understanding on how various factors may affect the accelerated ageing of aerogel  glazing it is ideal to test each condition (strain) separately and then in various combinations. Individual  strains can provide a rough understanding to what extent the given specimen is sensitive to. The  cumulative strain (i.e. combination of various ageing mechanisms) would be greater than the total sum  of the individual strains since some mechanisms are more potent in combination with other factors.   Several types of equipment were used for facilitate the accelerated ageing: the oven, temperature  cycling machine, climatic chamber and humidity chambers. Various glazing samples were placed in the  equipment for a period of 1 month (28 days) at a time after which they were measured using either a  spectrophotometer for optical properties or heat flow meter for thermal properties. After each set of  measurements, the samples are visually inspected and documented and placed back for the cycle to  repeat.   

3.2.1 Oven 
  Elevated temperatures increase the kinetic reaction rates in chemical degradation processes. The  mechanical convection oven by ColeParmer (RK5230130) is microprocessorcontrolled which allows  for precise control and good uniformity by allowing for easy setup and monitoring functions (Cole Parmer MicroprocessorControlled Mechanical Convection Oven, 5.0 cu. ft. 115 VAC, n.d.). Two units  were placed in the oven in vertical orientation (with wooden spacers to provide air circulation), unit 3  (30x30cm, no aerogel) and unit 9 (30x30cm, Cabot P300 Aerogel). Vertical orientation is closer to real  life application since the majority of glazing units would be installed in that orientation. The set point  temperature was set to 70Â°C which is at the higher end of the normally accepted highend safe  temperature range of 6070Â°C for accelerated ageing of polymers (secondary seal). The highest safe  temperature was chosen to test the specimens at as high temperature as possible and to accelerate the  temperature degradation as much as possible. A relative humidity of 15% was maintained within the  chamber during testing.

3.2.2 Temperature Cycling Machine 
  The next piece of equipment is the temperature cycling machine. This apparatus consists of the freezer  which is the main component that houses a few other pieces of equipment that provide it with the  ability to have temperature cycling also known as freezing and thawing cycling. The freezer is Salton  Upright Freezer CF2060 (COMPACT FREEZER 3.0 CU. FT. (85 LITRE) , n.d.) which houses the STEGO  100W Fan Heater HVL 031 (Fan Heater Part # 03102.900, HVL 031 , n.d.) and Onset HOBO Data Logger  (temp/RH) U10003 (HOBO Temperature Relative Humidity Data Logger, n.d.) at the bottom storage  compartment. Temperature cycling is controlled via Intermatic ET1115C 24hr basic electronic control  (ET1115C | 24Hour Basic Electronic Control, n.d.) which is installed on the side of freezer.  The interior volume of the freezer is smaller when compared to the oven thus having less available area  for specimen placement. Due to the need to share the machine and the inability to move the shelving,  the selected specimen had to be placed horizontally to occupy one of the bays. Unit 8 (30x30cm) which  has the "perfect" amount of Cabot P300 aerogel fill was placed horizontally on a wooden tray to prevent  contact with the metal shelf. The temperature cycling machine runs on 24 hour cycles as following; 5  hour warm up periods to reach a temperature of 40Â°C (relative humidity 55% to 40%), the temperature  is maintained at 40Â°C (humidity around 40%) for 7 hours, next it takes 4 hours to cool down to 30Â°C  (relative humidity 25% to 45%) where the temperature is stays constant for 8 hours (relative humidity  45% to 55%) and then the cycle repeats.

3.2.3 Climatic Chamber 
  UV radiation is responsible for the majority of the photodegradation for materials that are exposed to  outdoor conditions. The QAV/se's fluorescent lamps are able to simulate the critical shortwave UV  radiation and reproduce the physical damage caused by sunlight. Some of the potential damage to the  materials include loss of gloss, cracking, hazing, embrittlement and color change. It is interesting to note  that dew, not rain, is responsible for the vast majority of wetness that occurs outdoors. The apparatus is  able to simulate dew by purifying tap water through evaporation which is actually the distillation  process which removes impurities from the water. The chemical degradation processes started by the  UV radiation and condensation will have increased kinetic reaction rates as a result of the increased  temperatures.  The next apparatus is the climatic chamber which has a combination of UV radiation, temperature and  high humidity. The climatic chamber, QLAB Accelerated Weathering Tester QAV/se (QUV ACCELERATED  WEATHERING TESTER, n.d.), is compatible with several types of lamps and can support different  weathering cycles. The selected cycle is cycle 6 based on ASTM G15416 standard (ASTM, 2016) with the  following schedule; 8 hours of UV radiation at 60Â°C (Â±3Â°C) black panel temperature and 4 hours of  condensation (100% RH) at 50Â°C (Â±3Â°C) black panel temperature.   31   

 

Unit 1 (top left), Unit 5 (top right) and Unit 2 (bottom right)  are placed in the machine  Figure 14  QLAB Accelerated Weathering Tester  Model QAV/se 

  Due to the combination of UV, moisture and heat, it possible that there could be some significant  changes in the optical properties of the aerogel glazing. Since the measuring area is quite small, and the  measure instrument itself supports only smaller size, the 10x10 units were selected which also allowed  for a few of them to be aged simultaneously. Unit 1 (no aerogel), unit 2 (Cabot P300 aerogel) and unit 5  (Airglass aerogel) were placed inside the apparatus. It would have been ideal to include two control IGUs  in the ageing apparatus and have a least three replicas for each aerogel type for better statistical  evaluation of results but due to materials availability and scope limitation it was not feasible.    3.2.3.1 Lamps  The QAV/se tester supports a variety of ultraviolet lamps which are equivalent to conventional 40W  fluorescent lamps in terms of power consumption and physical size. Each lamp is different in the total  amount of UV radiation it emits as well as the wavelength spectrum. Fluorescent UV lamps are generally  categorized into UVA or UVB lamps depending on the region where most of their output falls. The  exposure application defines the need which in turn determines which lamp and cycle should be used.   UVA lamps do not have any radiation output below the wavelength of 295nm so they do not degrade  materials as quickly as UVB lamps. They also provide better spectrum accuracy with actual outdoor  weathering. UVA340 lamps provide the best simulation of sunlight in the critical region of short  wavelength radiation from 295 to 365nm. The peak emission appears at 340nm, hence the name, and  they are especially useful for comparison tests of different configurations. UVA351 simulates the UV  radiation as if filtered through glass window which is not applicable for this research.   UVB has the shortest wavelength radiation of sunlight at the earth's surface. These types of lamps emit  unnatural, shortwave radiation below the cutoff of 295nm and can cause anomalous results as such it is  common for them to be used for quality control and research and development. The UVB 313EL  produces high levels of UV radiation and is generally used for quality control and research and  development, particularly for durable materials. It replaces the UVB313 since it is more stable and  provides fast results. The second type of UVB lamp is QFS40 which is also known as FS40 or F40 UVB, it  32   

was the original lamp for this apparatus. They are predominantly used for automotive coatings and are  only available on the QUV/basic model.   Other manufacturers might have similar UV lamps with similar names but can have very different  irradiance, spectral power distribution and ageing characteristics, as such it is recommended to use Q Lab original lamps for best and most consistent results. Mixing different types of bulbs will result in  uneven ageing. UVA 340 is the most suitable lamp which provides the most accurate natural UV  radiation in the critical wavelength. One of the benefits in the QUV/se model is the ability to control and  monitor the irradiance via SOLAR EYE. Even after the lamps have been used for a period of time, the  needed intensity level can still be maintained by automatically adjusting the power level.    3.2.3.2 Mounting Considerations  The QUV/se model supports a few types of flat specimen holders. The standard holders support  75x150mm (exposure area 63x95mm) samples which do not fit the 100x100 samples. There are two  more types of brackets that support 100x150mm (exposure area 88x95mm) and 150x150mm (exposure  area 95x132mm) samples. The other issue is the circular retaining rings which support fairly flat  samples. There would have been a need to order thick panel retaining clips which are designed to hold  specimen of thicknesses of 619mm in the same flat panel holders which would be insufficient for the  aerogel glazing units (25mm thickness).   Replacement trays had to be custom made by the fabrication shop using galvanized steel. It is  mentioned in ASTM G15416 that the trays would need to be made from corrosion resistant alloys of  aluminum and stainless steel, which were not available to the shop at the time. Theoretically, the  galvanized steel would be able to perform well, unless it was cut to expose the untreated material which  had to be done in order to create custom openings in the size of 90x90mm. The units occupied 3  openings and were secured using UV and heat resistant zip ties by Arctic Tie (ICE1180C). Each sample  was secured using three ties, two creating an "X" overlap at the bottom to provide gravity support and  one more horizontally to prevent samples from tilting. Due to the nature of the thick zip tie plastic (i.e.  bending radius), there is a gap on the interior side which does allow UV light to reach areas that are  directly behind the ties due to the multiple lamp configuration. The remaining fourth opening was  sealed using a galvanized steel plate from the same batch and held in place with aluminum tape. This  was done to have proper vapour seal for the condensation phase of the cycling.

3.2.4 Humidity Chambers 
  Water in its various states such as wind driven rain, precipitation, free water, water vapour  condensation and relative humidity can all factor in the degradation of building components (Jelle,  Accelerated climate ageing of building materials, components and sturctures in the laboratory, 2012).  Aerogel within IGUs is not exposed to free water or rain due to its protective enclosure which means  that the effects of vapour condensation and humidity are the primary focus. Although aerogel  undergoes a treatment to become moisture resistant via hydrophobic surface treatment, the silica  skeleton structure can be still prone to collapse due to ingress of moisture. Constant moisture pressure  could degrade aerogel due to surface tension of the water.    3.2.4.1 Chamber 1  In order to evaluate the effects of accelerated moisture ageing, a custombuilt dedicated humidity  chamber (1) was used to create a high moisture environment. Temperature and relative humidity set  points were set to 40Â°C and 90% respectively to create high vapour pressure drive. The actual  temperature and humidity fluctuated in the range of 4346Â°C and 6585% RH. Unit 6 which is of the  smaller variety (10x10cm) with Airglass aerogel was placed inside of this chamber in a free standing  vertical position for the duration of the ageing.  This chamber was built with interior dimensions of 118(l) x 68.5(w) x 45(h) cm using 1cm thick acrylic  glass. The acrylic glass box is encased in 50mm rigid XPS insulation (RSI 1.76) to reduce the amount of  heat loss to the ambient air within the laboratory. In order to maintain as high air tightness as possible,  the removable top (lid) of the chamber was lined with closed cell selfadhesive weatherstrip foam tape  (Climaloc CF21002). Raised floor was built out of perforated galvanized metal and raised by using clay  bricks. This allows for uniform moisture and temperature distribution throughout the chamber.  A humidity and temperature controller (INKBIRD IHC230) was used to control a heat lamp (Sylvania  13840, 175w PAR38, red) which was mounted with a porcelain clamp lamp (by Zoo Med) to maintain the  air temperature as close to the set point as possible. Portions of the interior surface near the heat lamp  were lined with aluminum foil to disperse the heat deeper throughout the chamber. A humidity  controller (INKBIRD IHC200) was used to control a bucket heater (Miller Manufacturing Company 742G)  that was kept submerged inside the clear plastic container (20L) filled with distilled water.    3.2.4.2 Chamber 2  A second chamber (2) was built as well with the primary intention to increase the moisture content of  given samples. This chamber was set to a temperature of 23Â°C and 70% relative humidity. The actual  temperature was around 2224Â°C while the relative humidity was 6570%. Although the temperature  and relative humidity configuration were not as severe as chamber 1, this chamber serves as good  comparison to see how prone a given sample is to ingress of moisture and how much of a performance  reduction can be expected. This chamber housed unit 7 which is smaller (10x10cm) with Airglass aerogel  in free standing vertical position.  

34   

The chamber was built using 50mm XPS rigid insulation boards (RSI 1.76) with sheathing housewrap  tape (Tuck Tape) to provide better air tightness as secondary air barrier. The interior dimensions are  90(l) x 50(w) x 37(h) cm that house a clear 104L plastic container (Sterilite ClearView Tote with latch)  that acts as the primary air tightness barrier. Raised floor was also incorporated into this chamber using  perforated galvanized metal on clay bricks for good distribution of temperature and water vapour. A  temperature and humidity controller (INKBIRD IHC230) was set to control an incandescent bulb (Noma  60W Incandescent Bulb, Transparent Red) inside a clamp on shade (Sunlite E1201) to maintain the  temperature. The humidity controller (INKBIRD IHC200) controlled a humidifier (Zoo Med Repti  FoggerTM Terrarium). A portable dehumidifier (22W Homasy Portable Mini Dehumidifier) was also wired  independently to make sure the relative humidity does not exceed the set point. Both of the chambers  were constructed by two graduate students as part of their research into high performance insulation  materials and aerogel.

3.2.5 Acceleration factors 
  Real life durability data collection is an extended process and is generally not suitable for high tech  materials and products but the data is still needed in order to generate market penetration and acquire  market share. Aerogel, and specifically aerogel glazing falls into that category, and the most suitable  35   

approach to test the durability is via accelerated ageing. This type of ageing exposes the products to  various climatic stresses that exceed typical use conditions.   The combination of aerogel fill inside of IGUs has the potential to present a unique set of challenges.  Some of the mechanisms that are present and play a role in ageing of aerogel in its standalone state  could either be completely ignored or greatly exaggerated when aerogel is incorporated into a multi layer configuration. On the most fundamental level, an aerogel IGU would be composed of two lites of  glass, spacer, sealant and aerogel filled cavity. The components that make up the base of the IGU also  serve as the enclosure for the aerogel and in theory are supposed to provide protection thus  maintaining its high level of performance in addition to its already high durability.  It is important to understand how the length and intensity of the various degradation mechanisms  effects the aerogel when it is configured in an IGU. In order to provide an estimate as to how much  equivalent real life time has passed for a given accelerated ageing period, acceleration factors need to  be calculated. The accelerated temporal ageing tests included elevated temperatures, temperature  cycling, and combination of UV radiation, high temperature and humidity. In order to provide a rough  estimate as to how long equivalent real service life each ageing sequence has yielded, a series of  equations (Arrhenius relationship, CoffinManson equation and Peck model) were employed to serve as  the theoretical basis.      3.2.5.1 Elevated temperature  A constant high temperature can be used for accelerated ageing in order to detect potential defects or  failure modes in a short period of time. The Arrhenius relationship was originally formulated for  accelerated life testing with the acceleration stress selection being thermal. This model relates the  exposure time of the experimental temperature to that of the use condition temperature. This formula    


  

(1) 

Where AFTemp is the acceleration factor due to temperature stressing (Crowe & Feinberg, 2001)(Jelle,  2012), EA is the activation energy of the failure mechanism, k is the Boltzmann constant (8.617 Ã 105  eV/K), TA is the accelerated temperature (in Kelvin) and TU is the use condition temperature (in Kelvin).  The  activation  energy  (Ea)  is  the  minimum  required  energy  that  is  needed  to  initiate  a  chemical  reaction  and  it  is  a  property  of  the  material  being  tested.  From  the  Aerogel  Handbook  (Aegerter,  Leventis,  &  Koebel, 2011), aerogel is assumed to be temperature independent and has activation energy of about 70  kJ/mol. The constant use temperature was assumed to be equal to 20Â°C (293.15K).   Given the conditions in the oven mentioned in section 3.2.1 and the information above, the acceleration  factor was calculated to be 65.5. A testing period of 4 months (117 days) is equivalent to 21 years of  typical use conditions. It is important to note that the higher the average annual temperature that is  plugged as the use condition, the lower the accelerated factor which makes this type of calculation  region specific.

  3.2.5.2 Temperature cycling (freeze thawing cycles)  Temperature fluctuations are a part of the natural weather cycles with even high temperature  differences occurring during the winter season where the indoor temperature is quite warm while  outdoor is below freezing. Having a material or product fluctuate between high and low temperatures  can cause cumulative stress (thermal shock) that may result in a failure which in turn would compromise  the performance. The CoffinManson equation (Delserro Enginerring Solutions, 2014) is able to provide  a simplified calculation method for an acceleration factor due to freezing and thawing cycles:   
  

 

(2) 

Where AFTemp cycling is the acceleration factor due to temperature cycling, Ttest is the temperature  difference in the testing chamber (from 30Â°C to 40Â°C  Ttest = 70Â°C), Tuse is the temperature  difference in natural outdoor climate conditions (assumed 20Â°C for Toronto) and m is fatigue, or the  CoffinManson exponent [typically 3 (Delserro Enginerring Solutions, 2014)].   Using the set points outlined in section Error! Reference source not found. and above, the acceleration  factor was calculated to be 42.88. A total of 117 days (4 months) of accelerated ageing in the  temperature cycling machine with freeze thaw cycling is equivalent to 13.5 years of regular outdoor  exposure.     3.2.5.3 Elevated temperature, UV radiation and high humidity  The combination of multiple environmental conditions can create severe stress on any given material or  product. The alternating combination of heat assisted UV and humidity degradation was aimed to  simulate more conditions which would cause a compounded effect on the samples.   The combined acceleration factor for the entire test span (AFTHUV) is a strong simplification which is  based on Peck Model and the Arrhenius relationship but is specific to the climatic chamber cycling.  These models are used in combination with a simple proportion between the total UV energy during  ageing (A) and the natural outdoor ageing process (U) to find the combined acceleration factor:       (3) 

Where AFH is the humidity acceleration factor (Crowe & Feinberg, 2001), AFT1 is the temperature  acceleration factor during the 4hr test cycle where only temperature and humidity are involved, AFT2 is  the temperature acceleration factor during the 8hr test cycle where only temperature and UV radiation  are operational, AFUV (Jelle, 2012) is the UV acceleration factor and AFTHUV is the combined acceleration 

37   

factor for both temperature, humidity and UV radiation. The equation can be then separated into its  component pieces:              


  

(1)  (4)  (5) 

Where RHA is the relative humidity of the test, RHU is the relative humidity in natural outdoor climate  conditions, TA is the temperature in the ageing chamber, TU is the temperature in natural outdoor  climate conditions (average annual temperature for Toronto is 15Â°C), m is a humidity constant (2.66), EA  is the activation energy (= 0.7 eV).  U is total energy during natural outdoor ageing [3.67 kWh/m2/d * 365 days = 1339.55 kWh/m2  [Toronto International airport (RETScreen 4)]. A is the total UV energy during accelerated ageing  (14935.8 kWh/m2) which was calculated by averaging the multiplied typical irradiances (1.55 W/m2*nm)  by each wavelength (nm) to find the average intensity in W/m2 and converting it to kWh/m2.  Using the information provided above and in section 3.2.3, the acceleration factors were calculated as  following; AFT1= 14.36, AFH= 7.4, AFT2= 31 and AFUV= 11.15. Based on these values, the combined  acceleration factor was found to be AFTHUV= 265 [AFTHUV can range from 5 to 250 (Jelle, 2012)]. A testing  period of 102 days (2439 hours) is equivalent to 74 years of natural outdoor exposure conditions.     3.2.5.4 High relative humidity  Extended periods of exposure to water in its liquid and vapour form can cause stress and premature  failures in certain materials or products. The high relative humidity generates high vapour drive into a  given sample as well as potentially creating condensation on the surface. Exposing a sample to these  conditions alone is not enough since without the activation energy from higher temperature, no  reactions would take place.  The combined acceleration factor for humidity and elevated temperature (AFTH) is based on the  combination of Arrhenius and Peck models and used for estimating the equivalent real life span of a  material when both temperature and humidity are accelerated (Crowe & Feinberg, 2001).       (6) 

The equation is then further broken down to its components:

Where AFH is the humidity acceleration factor (Crowe & Feinberg, 2001), AFT is the temperature  acceleration factor, AFTH is the combined acceleration factor for both temperature and humidity, RHA is  the relative humidity of the test, RHU is the relative humidity in natural outdoor climate conditions, TA is  38

Table 5  Accelerated ageing duration for humidity chambers 

Using the information provided above and in section 3.2.4.1, the acceleration factor was calculated to  be 88 (for chamber 1). A testing period of 2 months (57 days) is equivalent to 13.5 years of natural  outdoor exposure conditions. As mentioned previously, due to unresolved technical malfunctions with  the heating coil, this calculation should be considered more of an ideal scenario or nominal value but is  lower in reality. Also, an acceleration factor is not provided for the second chamber since the conditions  were not as severe, thus serving more as control for chamber 1 and to check if there is any moisture  accumulation inside of the IGU for the purposes of moisture content measurements.   

3.3 Testing 
  It is would be unfortunate if a high performance product would deteriorate a significant amount over a  span of 1520 years. In order to design a well performing and durable products, durability data, and  performance testing after accelerated ageing is crucial. Performance testing can be used to test various  properties such as compressive and tensile strength, moisture absorption and retention, colour changes  and transparency changes. This research focuses on two important aspects for a glazing, thermal and  optical properties.   Glazed components comprise large portions of building facades and in their current state are large  source of heat transfer. Minimizing heat transfer through glazed assemblies could be a great increase to  energy efficiency. The second, is the glazing's ability to provide daylight and view to the outside. These  aspects are related to each other and play a significant role in a person's physical and mental wellbeing.  In addition, having sufficient amount of daylight in interior spaces could reduce the need for artificial  lighting which in turn can provide energy savings. The two equipment used to test the thermal and  optical properties are the heat flow meter and the spectrophotometer respectively.   

3.3.1 Thermal performance measurements  
  Thermal conductivity is the measure of a given material's ability to conduct heat. In building  applications, it is generally desired to have as high thermal resistance as possible. Higher resistance to  heat transfer means smaller heat movement over the building envelope which in turn mean less energy  is wasted on maintaining comfortable indoor conditions. To measure thermal conductivity, the NETZSCH  HFM 436 Lambda Heat Flow Meter was used (HFM 436 Lambda Heat flow meter, n.d.). The large  39   

samples (30x30cm) size was specifically chosen to accommodate this machine as to eliminate the need  to have foam "housing" to get a better center of glass measurement. A housing or a sleeve would be  needed to bring the samples of smaller size to the 30x30cm size for proper testing. Although the actual  heat flow instrument is only 10cm in diameter, one would not want heat to move from the sides but  rather in a single linear direction, from top to bottom.   For many materials, even insulation materials, the thermal conductivity is a function of temperature. For  this reason, it was important to measure the aerogel's performance in a temperature range to see how  it fares when compared to other insulation types (aerogel is used in blankets for exterior applications).  The selected (mean) temperatures were as following; 10, 0, 10, 20, 24, 30, 40 and 50Â°C to reflect a  range of exterior conditions across multiple seasons. In order to measure the thermal conductivity, the  machine generates a temperature difference across the sample (T). The top plate is warmer one, while  the bottom plate is the colder one. The temperature difference is set to 20Â°C which means 10Â°C degrees  below and above the mean temperature set point.    

Sample inside the heat flow meter  Figure 18  NETZSCH HFM 436 Lambda Heat Flow Meter (right) and Julabo FP50MA Refrigerated/Heating Circulator (left) 

  Having a larger temperature difference is beneficial for an even more accurate measurement regardless  of the accuracy of the equipment. During the third testing session (after two months ageing), the  temperature difference for the first mean temperature (10Â°C) was changed from T=20Â°C to T=10Â°C  to reduce stress on the machine and reduce testing duration with no change to the accuracy. There are  four models of HFM 436 Lambda and this particular unit is able to achieve such low test temperatures  due to use of Julabo FP50MA Refrigerated/Heating Circulator (FP50MA Refrigerated/Heating  Circulator, 2017). One measurement cycle takes roughly 1012 hours to complete all eight points which  would make it very time consuming to execute three times for more accurate results.    

3.3.2 Optical performance measurements 
  Optical performance for a glazing units can have multiple measurement criteria such as, solar heat gain,  visible transmittance, reflectance and absorbance. In most conventional glazing units there is a balance  between the properties above; there is no scenario where one glazing has all the best qualities,  40   

generally speaking it is a tradeoff. For aerogel glazing, the size of cavity is what controls the thermal  resistance which means that the larger the cavity, the better the thermal performance. Visible  transmittance is an important parameter for any glazing unit since it quantifies the amount of light  getting to the interior which is predominately what glazing is used for in buildings.   Granular aerogel glazing is different (from monolithic) since it is used for diffused daylighting purposes  due to the granules scattering, reflecting and refracting the light significantly thus reducing visual clarity  to the outdoors. Although granular aerogel glazing functions more like frosted glass, it still lets light  through. Absorbance is the measure of the amount of solar radiation that does not pass through a given  material and has an inverse relationship to solar transmittance.   The spectrophotometer by Agilent Technologies Â­ Cary 5000 UVVisNir Spectrophotometer is able to  measure absorbance in the range of 1753300nm (Cary 5000 UVVisNIR, n.d.). The absorbance was  measured in the solar radiation range of 2002000nm and was converted to transmittance which then  can be used for comparison and analysis. The apparatus supports samples for up to 120x120mm in size,  so having small set of units allows for easy and quick measuring with each test taking several minutes to  conduct.   

Sample inside the spectrophotometer  Figure 19  Agilent Technologies Â­ Cary 5000 UVVisNir Spectrophotometer 

  The measurements are done separately with a laser at each wavelength in the range of 2002000nm  using a PbSmart detector. The cross section area of the measurement is quite small which makes it  heavily dependent on which granules it passes through. It is preferable to test each sample multiple  times with rotation changes but the absorption curve stays the same for same type of aerogel and  would varies within 1015% bracket depending on which configuration of granules it passes through.   The detector measures light that was able to travel mostly in a linear trajectory, all the light that gets  scattered and reflected is essentially unaccounted for. Normally this is not an issue if used for  transparent samples, but if a translucent material is used (such as frosted glass or granular aerogel), the  light would be scattered. This is what gives frosted glass the ability to provide privacy while maintaining  light transmittance. Testing with the spectrophotometer without the integrating sphere measures the  amount of light that passes through the IGU, which is more akin to what the human eye would  experience.  41   

The counter argument point to this is that the transmittance values generated without the sphere would  be much lower and potentially misleading as to the actual amount of light passing through. Having an  integrating sphere provides the ability to measure all the light that passes through the aerogel glazing,  including the light that would not be visible to the human eye due to refraction and reflectance.   An integrating sphere is hollow with the internal white reflective surface (nonselective diffuse reflector)  with small entrance and exit ports. The geometry of the sphere is designed to collect the majority of  reflected or transmitted light (without directional preference) and directing a cumulative signal to the  detector. Integrating sphere are ideal for measuring the transmission of turbid, translucent or almost  opaque samples where standard practices are inadequate due to the loss of light from scattering effects.

4 RESULTS & ANALYSIS 
 

4.1 Thermal Performance 
  Thermal performance is focused on aspects of heat transfer through the tested assemblies  predominately via conduction which is primarily denoted by thermal conductance (W/m2K), thermal  resistance (Rvalue in m2K/W) and overall heat transfer coefficient (Uvalue in W/m2K). Thermal  conductivity is generally used for homogeneous materials but when testing products or assemblies,  using thermal conductance is more appropriate to show the overall ability of the heat to move through  the product.   The tests were carried out in roughly one month (45 weeks) intervals in order to get an understanding if  there were any intermediate changes and to make sure the IGUs were not compromised during the  ageing. The first test served as the initial benchmark in pristine condition performance which also  included unit 4 as control. Unit 4 was kept in room temperature conditions inside a case away from  direct daylight. It was measured only twice, test 1 and test 5. This was done to make sure that the  aerogel does not "naturally decay" within the IGU.  After each test, the heat flow apparatus provides a set of data (see appendix) which was used to plot  graphs (13). The thermal conductance values (YAxis) were plotted against the mean temperature (Â°C)  (XAxis) in a XY scatter graph. A constant slope trend line was added with the corresponding formula. It  is common practice in the industry to calculate the average thermal conductance at room temperature.  The thermal conductance (as outlined by ASTM C16815) for each IGU was calculated by first inversing  the thermal resistances that were provided by the heat flow meter followed by plotting a constant slope  trend line which allowed for the calculation of the overall conductance at 24Â°C.  The Cabot P300 aerogel granules were measured in the heat flow meter (no compaction) in pristine  condition at 20Â°C, 22Â°C and 24Â°C with a T of 10Â°C, 20Â°C and 10Â°C respectively. A similar methodology  was used with the creation of a trend line and the calculation of the thermal conductivity at 24Â°C was  found to be 0.0425 W/mK.  The focus on glazing only (as opposed to inclusion of window frame) meant that the performance  parameters for the IGUs are limited to center of glass measurements/calculations (Uvalue of glazing or  U value centerofglass) since overall Uvalue cannot be determined due to two reasons. The first reason  being that Uedge cannot be determined since there is no frame and secondly, Uedge is generally  simulated as a separate entity due to the nature of air movement in the cavity near the frame, but since  in this particular case the cavity is filled with mostly solid material, it is not applicable.

Looking at Figures 22 and 23 it is possible to see that the slope of conductance for aerogel is much  smaller (3Â° vs. 15Â°) than the slope for air conductance. A smaller slope is better from a performance  point of view since there will more consistency (less variation) in the thermal resistance across various  temperatures. Although argon gas has low thermal conductivity (0.017 W/mK) and if it were to be  configured in a similar IGU, the expected (for a cavity thickness of 13mm) Rvalue would be around 0.76  m2K/W. While this RSI value is higher than what was achieved by the aerogel (0.530.64 m2K/W), it is a  theoretical value and real life concentration of the gas would be less and combining it with the glass  could be a little lower i.e. more in line with the aerogel. Furthermore, the slope of the thermal  conductivity for the argon (or other gas) would be similar to that of the air, and as the gas escapes over  time, the line would move closer and closer to air line while the aerogel, even after ageing, would be  very close to its pristine condition having consistent performance over time and over temperature  range.  The accelerated ageing processes in the oven and temperature cycling machine have caused a very small  change in the thermal performance, with the most significant change being in the control unit (4%  difference). Unit 3 (no aerogel  oven) and 9 (Cabot P300 aerogel  oven) saw a difference of 3% and  1% respectively while unit 8 (Cabot P300 aerogel Â­ temperature cycling) had an increase of 1% in  conductance. These values are very small and fall within the margin of error (up to 5%) indicating that  the ageing had little impact on the aerogel's thermal performance.

Table 6  Thermal performance of IGUs before and after ageing 

The difference in the thermal performance between the pristine condition and after accelerated ageing  is quite small (up to 4%) and in some measurements, the thermal conductance has actually decreased as  opposed to the expected increase with time and ageing. The biggest increase was seen in the clear IGU  which is filled with air and fluctuations in the gas within the cavity could have played a factor. In the  aerogel units, the difference is much smaller and practically insignificant, and the biggest conclusion is  that the performance of the aerogel is still very close to its pristine condition. This translates into high  durability for granular aerogel and great ability to maintain energy performance over time.  Glazing Uvalues were found to be in the range of 1.51.8 W/m2K for IGUs with Cabot P300 aerogel while  the clear IGU (unit 3) ranged 5.55.7 W/m2K, 3.5 times higher than the aerogel. Comparing these values  45   

to some of the high performance glazing mentioned in Table 1 shows that this particular set of samples  has worse thermal performance (higher Uvalue). When comparing the best pristine condition of the  aerogel IGU (unit 9 Â­ test 1) to Cabot's Nanogel glazing with 10mm cavity which has a glazing Uvalue of  1.38 W/m2K, it is 14% lower while the 20mm cavity yielded a glazing Uvalue of 0.78 W/m2K which is  51% better.

4.2 Optical Performance   
The second aspect of windows is the transmittance of light for daylighting and visual connection to the  outdoors. Glazing in its current configuration is predominantly used to provide view to the outdoors,  and any modifications to the glazing (e.g. coatings, gas fills) are encouraged to improve performance but  only as long as they do not impede the visual fidelity too much.  The apparatus used for optical performance measurements was the spectrophotometer from the  chemistry department in Ryerson University. The apparatus uses an emitter to shoot laser beams at a  specimen and measure how many photons make it to the collector on the opposite side at different  wavelengths. The resulting absorption data is recorded by the onboard computer and relayed to a  workstation computer which then can be converted into Microsoft Excel file or other formats for data  analysis. The cross section area of the specimen through which the light passes is quite small and  depending on the arrangement of the granular can provide slightly different results with a variation of  5% (see Error! Reference source not found.) for the same type of aerogel. The smaller the granules, the  more consistent the results would be across various IGUs.  This particular machine does not have an integrating sphere which means that the light which gets  refracted and scattered is not accounted for, increasing the perceived absorbance. On the other hand,  not including an integrating sphere provides are more accurate representation of what a person might  experience when looking through an aerogel glazing, but it does not look attractive to designers.  The absorbance values cannot be used directly in the same fashion as the thermal conductivity or  thermal resistance values that are generated by the heat flow meter and require conversion prior to  analysis. Depending on the wavelength, some of the absorbance values can appear quite high which  required for all values above 2 to be normalized to 2. Next, a derivative of the BeerBouguerLambert  Law was used to convert the absorbance values to transmittance. The BeerBouguerLambert Law is  generally used in chemical analysis measurements to understand the attenuation of light. The original  formula is written as:    A log    (7) 

Where the A is the absorbance data from the spectrophotometer and T is transmittance. It can be  rearranged to solve for T as following:    0.1    (8) 

The reflectance can be calculated by subtracting the transmittance from one.  The range of wavelength testing was set to 2002000nm with 200nm being the lowest supported  wavelength by the apparatus and 2000nm as the upper limit to represent sun's radiation as it reaches  the earth's surface.

Figure 25  Optical Transmittance Test 1: pristine condition 

 

Figure 26  Optical Transmittance Test 4: 3 months of accelerated ageing (3 months for unit 6 + 7), measured up to 800nm 

 

  A clear IGU and a single piece of glass were measured in the first test as part of control group to get  understanding what the absorbance is for the base components of the IGUs. The clear IGU was found to  have a transmittance of 80% while a single piece of glass has a transmittance of 90% both of which are  in line with what was expected. The single glass transmits all of the UVA but only the majority of the  48   

UVB radiation while the clear IGU also transmits all of the UVB but only about 50% of the UVB. Since the  single glass transmits most of the UV radiation, it is assumed that the aerogel absorbs the majority of it  which is beneficial for accelerated ageing when examining the impact of UV radiation on it.  Unit 1 (no aerogel in climatic chamber) has similar performance in term of light transmittance to its  pristine condition to no surprise since glass has great properties and the air inside the cavity does not  really impede the passage of light unless there is condensation. Unit 2 (Cabot P300 aerogel in climatic  chamber) has very similar average visible transmittance with about a 4% reduction. This reduction is not  significant enough and potentially could be the result of the configuration of the aerogel since the units  undergo shaking after equalizing. Surprisingly, unit 5 (Airglass aerogel in climatic chamber) has shown  10% higher transmittance which seems counter intuitive and similarly to unit 2 could be the result of  light passing through a larger piece of aerogel which is more clear thus creating less scattering and  allowing more direct light through.   Unit 6 and 7 (Airglass aerogel) were aged in chamber 1 and 2 respectively and saw the biggest  differences in their average visible transmittance. Unit 6 which was aged in chamber 1 under the more  severe conditions saw a 211% decrease in the transmittance while unit 7 which was exposed to much  more mild, almost ambient room conditions, saw a 75% decrease. These results do appear to be in line  with the work of Ihara, et al. (2015) where the aged particles also had altered appearance and increased  thermal conductivity due to the degradation of the silica network after accelerated ageing.

4.3 Visual Analysis 
 

4.3.1 Temporary Shrinking of Aerogel Granular 
  Originally, unit 9 was assembled with a slightly too much aerogel which has caused a slight gap between  one of the glass panes and the spacer (at one of the corners). Even after the first ageing period (1  month), the aerogel in unit 9 showed significant shrinkage (Figure 27) which was repeated in the latter  measurements as well (about 45cm gap). The IGU units from the oven were taken out and were  allowed to equalize in room temperature before the thermal conductivity measurements the following  day (minimum of 24 hours). At which point unit 9 was shaken in order to create a more even distribution  of granular before the measurements. Surprisingly, the large air gap that was visible immediately after  taking the unit out of the oven has shrunk to 1cm gap, meaning that the same aerogel occupied more  volume at room temperature after the IGU was shook (Figure 29). Although the compaction of the  aerogel is due thermal stress, it is in line with the findings by Gao et al. (2014) that showed the tendency  of granular aerogel to shrink.  Another aspect that was noted after the visual inspection is that there were small aerogel particles  trapped between the glass and the spacer (Figure 32). This is likely due to the combination of the ageing  in the oven in the vertical orientation as well as the shaking of the IGU which forced more particles into  the gap that was initially created due to excess aerogel in the cavity. The portions along the spacer  where no gap was created, exhibited very little if any trapped aerogel (Figure 31).

Figure 32  IGU 9 (Test 5 after 4 months of accelerated  ageing) bottom left corner with aerogel sandwiched  between glass and spacer 

  Unit 9 was placed in the same oven at the same temperature set point but in the horizontal position for  one week. Once the unit was taken out and positioned vertically with minor shaking of the IGU, an air  gap was created. The gap measured 22.5cm. The unit was placed back in the oven to finish the one  month ageing period. The unit was taken out two weeks later with the gap size ranging 22.5cm (Figure  28). After equalizing overnight, and shaking the IGU, the gap was reduced to its 4 month aged size  (1cm) (Figure 30). These results imply that heat and not the orientation affects the volume shrinkage of  the aerogel.  A piece of monolithic Airglass aerogel (rough dimensions 20 x 25 x 18.5mm) was placed inside the oven  for a period of 10 days at the same set point as the ageing (70Â°C) with the intention to measure  expansion of the material. The dimensions were measured once before and after heating with the  difference being below 1% (with two of the sides showing smaller values after being heated). The  original shape of the piece only had two parallel sides with the other two sets requiring trimming with a  knife. The process of cutting did not yield fully parallel sides as well as causing chipping of small pieces  from the aerogel due to its brittleness.    

4.3.2 Altered Appearance of Aerogel Particles 
  51   

4.3.2.1 Large IGUs (30x30cm)  During the assembly process of the aerogel IGUs it was noted that a few of the particles (Figure 33) from  the Cabot P300 variety were not translucent but were opaque (off white appearance). Although their  initial quantity was quite small and essentially insignificant, due to their lack of translucency, they would  reduce the optical performance but their biggest negative impact is their visual appearance. The  quantity of the particles did not seem to increase in any of the ageing processes except in the elevated  temperature one. It would seem that prolong exposure to high temperature (70Â°C) has created more of  this type of particles (Figure 34).   These results are similar to those found by Ihara et al. (2015) but with the difference being humidity  ageing versus elevated temperature ageing. A possible cause for this phenomenon was considered to be  free water absorption but ruled out since the particles remained white after drying in 105Â°C heat for 48  or being aged at 70Â°C and 15% RH, in both cases removing any moisture.   Furthermore, it is mentioned that after ATRFTIR analysis, the white particles were missing the methyl  groups which are responsible for the hydrophobic surface but due to imperfections during the  treatment are not present. This would allow for some moisture to penetrate into the silica network (due  to water surface tension) and when sufficient mechanical stress is applied, the aerogel would break  exposing the nontreated interior. The exposed silica can react to various substances in the environment  such as CO2 and salts (in water) thus creating the altered appearance.

  Figure 33  Unit 9 (Cabot P300 Aerogel) pristine condition 

  On the other hand, the Airglass aerogel filled units did not include any such particles in both pristine and  aged conditions. Airglass aerogel was potentially manufactured as monolithic aerogel and then  mechanically stressed to create smaller particles that were treated to give them hydrophobic nature. 

52   

The potentially better application of hydrophobic treatment would alleviate stresses from the granular  that would have otherwise be caused by water surface tension.    4.3.2.2 Small IGUs (10x10cm)  Similar to the findings for the larger IGUs, the P300 aerogel in unit 2 also has shown a discoloration in  the particles specifically around the perimeter. Unit 2 has been aged in the climatic chamber which has  several ageing mechanisms such as UV radiation, elevated temperature and high humidity. In the  pristine condition, the unit has showed a few spots (Figure 35) where the aerogel particle was white  (opaque). After the accelerated ageing, the number of particles did not increase but the  opacity/translucency of the particles around the perimeter has modified, appearing more opaque when  compared to the pristine condition. This change does not affect the optical performance since the  spectrophotometer uses the center of glass for its measurements, but on the other hand, the full IGU  light transmittance would suffer as well as potentially creating esthetic discomfort.     

Figure 35  Unit 2 pristine condition 

Figure 36  Unit 2 after 3 months of accelerated ageing  showing significant increase in discoloured aerogel particles 

  The Airglass aerogel IGUs (units 5, 6, 7) have a different type of deterioration as it would seem to be  aerogel dust accumulation. All the Airglass aerogel units have shown varied amounts of the addition of  these very fine particles trapped within the IGU cavity. The particles in unit 6 (aged in chamber 1 at 40Â°C  and 90% RH) have migrated to the space between the spacer and the glass while the IGU cavity has just  the aerogel (Figure 40). It would seem that there was an outward pressure from the inside of the IGU  which has driven the particles towards the outside. Units 5 and 7 have smaller quantity of particles near  and on their spacers but also have some in the cavity itself (Figure 38). The presence of particles at their  current quantities would not pose much of an issue with regards to thermal or optical performance due  to their size and density and is mostly an esthetic nuisance.    53

4.3.3 Aerogel Granular Compaction 
  All the units from the small variety (10x10cm) have been accelerated aged using one of the two  methods, either in the climatic chamber or high humidity chamber. Unit 2 (Cabot P300 aerogel) and 5  (Airglass aerogel) were both aged in the climatic chamber where they were exposed to a combination of  UV radiation, high relative humidity and elevated temperature. After visual inspection and  documentation of the units after the ageing, it was noticed that unit 2 has experienced a very mild  shrinking of the aerogel volume. The gap was barely visible under the pristine conditions (Figure 41) and  has expanded after 3 months of exposure (Figure 43). Unit 5 on the other hand has maintained its  volume with the only major difference is the appearance of dust like substance near the spacer on one  54   

side and on the glass on the opposite side. The reason why unit 5 did not undergo any significant  compaction during the ageing could be attributed to mixture of larger and smaller granule sizes as  opposed to Cabot's P300.

Figure 43  Unit 2 (left) and unit 5 (right) after 3 months of  accelerated ageing 

Figure 44  Unit 6 (left) and unit 7 (right) after 3 months of  accelerated ageing 

  Unit 6 and 7 (both with Airglass aerogel) have been aged in the humidity chambers with unit 6  experiencing more extreme conditions in its ageing chamber (1) while chamber 2 had much more mild  conditions. Both unit 6 and 7 had small (>0.5cm) air gaps in their pristine conditions which increased to  roughly 0.5cm after the accelerated ageing. It is interesting to note that although both humidity  chambers had different moisture loads, the compaction of the aerogel inside both the IGUs seem to be  very similar.   Although the compaction of both types of aerogels is the result of stress, it is in line with findings that  showed the tendency of granular aerogel to shrink (Gao, Jelle, Ihara, & Gustavsen, 2014). It is possible  that certain moisture exposure in terms of intensity or length may have resulted in the deterioration of  the aerogel up to a maximum point after which, the extra stress from heat or moisture did not add to  the deterioration. The compaction of the aerogel granules created a bigger air gap that would have a  negative impact on the thermal conductance of the unit and creates visual esthetic discomfort.        55   

5 DISCUSSION 
 

5.1 Performance benchmarking 
  The tested units, both in pristine and in aged condition, have very similar performance to one another  which indicates great durability. Although this is a highly beneficial property to have, but it is not enough  to justify the use of AGUs in buildings, thus must be benchmarked against the competition to prove their  viability. Since the aged units were separated into two groups, there are two independent sets of data  with the smaller units built for optical testing while the larger ones were used for thermal testing. This  configuration was optimized for ease of testing but it also meant that there was no combined set of data  (optical and thermal) for any unit.   For purpose of benchmarking, the thermal and optical performance data from the various IGU tests was  merged to create theoretical units to reflect the combined performance. Following this methodology,  three theoretical units were created to reflect the possible best performance, worst performance and  control unit (nonaged units' performance). The Uvalues were taken from Table 6 while the visible  transmittance (TVIS) was calculated by averaging all the values in the range of 380780nm. The  performance for the various benchmarking units was presented by the manufacturer in the most ideal  conditions and at times could be slightly skewed in their favour by using a specific methodology.  All of the benchmarked assemblies are commercialized products which were optimized for their  category and expected performance. The majority of the units are somewhat following the trend where  lower Uvalue (better thermal performance) comes at the expanse of lower visible transmittance (worse  optical performance) and vice versa. There are some outliers to this trend but there could be other  parameters that are less than desirable such as increased thickness, increased weight and much higher  cost due to assembly complexity.   Looking at the theoretical units which are bunched up on the right hand side of the graph, it is possible  to see that they are being outperformed in both categories. As discussed in previous sections, the lack of  integrating sphere during the spectrophotometer testing measured visible transmittance values below  10% since it was unable to capture all the light that got reflected and refracted. An obvious solution  would have been to retest the units after installing the sphere which was not feasible at the time. An  alternative solution would have been to measure a known Tvis piece of frosted/privacy glass to see if it  too would yield a low visible transmittance values confirming that the low values are indeed due to lack  of integrating sphere.   On the thermal side, there was no missing equipment but the center of glass Uvalues are still not  competitive with the rest of the units. The best performing unit has a Uvalue of 1.57 W/m2K with 13mm  of granular aerogel while the worst performing commercial aerogel glazing with 10mm of NanogelÂ® is  able to reach 1.38 W/m2K. Although the difference is not large, but in theory, the difference should be  much smaller than 14% especially considering the both aerogel types are manufactured by Cabot.  Moving to a large cavity size of 20mm, the Uvalue becomes roughly half at 0.78 W/m2K, or twice as  good, right below the Passive House's Uvalue0.8 W/m2K. NanogelÂ® is no available and was the 

56   

predecessor to the LumiraÂ® aerogel particles which is what is currently offered by Cabot for their glazing  solutions.  A simple double glazing with 13mm cavity filled with argon would yield a rough Uvalue of 1.31 W/m2K  which is roughly equivalent to the Cabot Nanogel worst performer and 16% better than the best  performing tested AGU. The advertised value for aerogel is quite low and in theory would provide even  performance than argon gas but looking at granular aerogel, the thermal conductivity value becomes  higher in its uncompressed state and come very close to argon when compressed properly. Based on  this information it was expected that granular aerogel glazing would perform on part with argon filled  IGUs.    

Figure 45  Comparison of high performance glazing systems with aged samples performance 

  There could be several factors behind the discrepancy between the AGUs' thermal performances. The  compaction level as seen in this research, in Lumira's specification sheet and mentioned by Neugebauer  et al. (2014) indicates that there an optimal level of compaction for granular aerogel. The increase in  performance from compaction for the assembled AGUs is almost double aligning with Neugebauer's  findings. It is possible that Cabot's P300 optimal compaction level for 13mm thickness was not achieved  and some performance loss was suffered there. This information is not supplied by Cabot and could be a  potential area for future research.  Another factor that could play a significant role in the discrepancy is the selection of the aerogel  particles. The P300 particles do not have their thermal or optical properties listed in the specification  sheet (potentially due large variation within the product line) and looking just the experimental value  57   

shows that they are much worse than Lumira (Table 7) which is specifically designed and targeted for  glazing applications. Using aerogel particles that were designed to be used in glazing could help bring  the Uvalue closer inline to what is expected for it to be competitive with argon filled IGUs.     P300  LumiraÂ®  LumiraÂ®    Since the benchmarking was done on commercialized IGUs, the use of optimal glass types and thickness  as well coating/films would also create a better performing glazing unit. The tested AGUs were  assembled with basic components to isolate the impact of the aerogel on both optical and thermal  performance, but in doing so, puts them in a disadvantage in a benchmarking. The selection of the glass  and coatings can have a sizable impact on the performance differences.  The selection of the spacer can also have an impact on the thermal performance of the AGU. Using a  smaller size IGU for testing in HFM would have meant that the granules would be closer to the edge and  more effected by the type of spacer especially if it highly conductive like aluminum. The edgeofglazing  is measured from the frame or divider is considered to be 63.5mm (2.5") so subtracting two edges from  300mm length of the tested AGUs leaves 173mm and with the sensor being 100mm in diameter, the  edge condition should not be an issue. In addition to that, the chosen spacer for assembly was Super  SpacerÂ® which has a Uvalue of 0.2 W/m2K well below that of the aerogel for the same thickness.  The maximum increase in CoG Uvalue for the tested units was 4% while aged double and tripled glazed,  argon filled IGUs tested by Asphaug et al. (2016) had increase of 4% and 5% respectively (after 70 weeks  of ageing). Given that the IGUs rely on the retention of the gas to maintain their thermal performance, a  leak or seal failure could cause the gas to escape causing an increase of 23% and 35% in the Uvalue for  double and triple glazed units while a similar incident for an AGU would have minimal impact.

5.2 Impact on Energy Consumption 
  The impact of deteriorating envelope components can be quite substantial over time and having high  durability for a given product or material is crucial for long term performance. Based on the energy  simulation carried out by (Asphaug, Jelle, Gullbrekken, & UvslÃ¸kk, 2016) it is possible to get a sense of  what the impact of decreased performance might mean over a span of 20 years. Two building typologies  were investigated in the simulation, commercial and residential (single family house), both of which are  the target audience for aerogel glazing. Both of the buildings were simulated in the Norwegian climate  which is quite cold with significant heating demands.   The office building has a heated floor space of 3500m2 (@ 20% WWR) and after accelerated ageing for  period of 70 weeks which yielded a 4% decrease in the Uvalue, the building saw an increase of 64.8  MWh due to loss in gas concentration. Four percent is the highest difference that the accelerated  58   

testing of the P300 aerogel yielded, meaning that this type of increase could cost the building owners  10,000 CAD (converted from Norwegian Krone) over a span of 20 years or $500 yearly. For an operation  of a commercial building, such small decrease in performance is not significant enough to warrant  concern. Having said that, 4% decrease in Uvalue is the maximum for granular aerogel while for IGUs  this essentially the minimum value and costs for the same office building can be $1375 and $2690 for  50% and 100% gas loss respectively.  For a single family dwelling with a floor space of 160m2 (@ 20% WWR) the increase in energy  consumption would be 1280 KWh in a span of 20 years by using the maximum of 4% increase in the U value. This increase is roughly $210 which is insignificant for that length of time but this is assuming  current prices and trends. For gas concentrations of 50% and 100% loss the extra cost for 20 years would  be $585 ($30/year) and $1140 ($57) respectively which are still quite small amounts. As the weather  becomes more severe with climate change and energy prices' continual rise, the difference would  increase as well, but it would only start to really matter when there is a yearly difference of a few  hundred dollars.

5.3 Applications of Granular Aerogel Glazing in Buildings 
  Aerogel glazing, granular based specifically, has been incorporated into several buildings over the years  but it was mostly done as an experiment or a novelty item as opposed from a pure superior  performance point of view (i.e. superior optical and thermal performance) but it is slowly changing with  designers taking advantage of its unique properties. The current market for granular aerogel glazing  applications is primarily focused on daylighting and glare control especially in highly glazed facades.  Skylights and north facing glazing orientations are the most suitable candidates due to reduced direct  sunlight providing soft diffused light but also function very well in other orientations by reducing glare.  Two of the more notable projects where granular aerogel was incorporated into the glazing system are  Yale University's Sculpture Building (New Haven, Connecticut, USA) and the National Circus School  (Montreal, Canada).   59   

The sculpture building is a four story building with almost entirely glass faÃ§ade that is composed from  KalwallÂ® (curtain wall system) in combination with Cabot's LumiraÂ® aerogel in a configuration. The  interior height of the spaces is 4.27m with only mullions dividing the glass occupying the entire height.  The entire lower section of the full height glazing is composed out of AGUs (aerogel glazing units) while  the upper portion has a mixture of vision and aerogel IGUs. The combination of the granular aerogel in  the curtain wall system is able to provide a RSI of 3.52 m2K/W (Uvalue 0.28 W/m2K) and functions as a  replacement for the spandrel panels and privacy screens while providing ample daylight with reduced  glare.   The circus school is a multistory building that features a large atrium like space with large glazed areas  to provide it with daylight. In this case, the glazing system is the combination of SOLERAÂ® plus Cabot's  LumiraÂ® aerogel (25mm thickness) with an RSI of 0.88 m2K/W (Uvalue 1.14 W/m2K). This system was  designed to provide diffused sunlight as well as eliminating hot spots and glare as well as having similar  thermal performance as triple glazed (gas filled) system at a similar price point.   Another granular aerogel combination system which is getting traction is the use of Pilkington ProfilitTM  (glass channels) with LumiraÂ® aerogel. The glass channels are already translucent in nature with  potentially similar optical properties to that of the granular aerogel. Building 115 in Seattle (by Graham  Baba Architects) is prime example of this system in use where a large glazed street facing faÃ§ade is able  to provide both daylight into the spaces while maintaining privacy.  A popular trend seems to emerge among the buildings that do incorporate granular aerogel that  pertains to the type of glass which is being used for the enclosure. Although granular aerogel has good  durability, it can suffer from discoloration over time. In order to combat that and provide appealing  aesthetics regardless of the age of the assembly is use, several of the systems choose to use frosted or  translucent glass. Using this methodology allows for the visual aesthetic to be maintained regardless of  the condition of the aerogel inside the cavity.  Aside from the selection of the type of glass, the second and equally as important design choice is to  have a combination of clear vision glass with the aerogel IGUs. Until monolithic glass with exception  clarity and thermal performance becomes common place, alternating between the two types allows the  designers to provide views (connection to the outdoors), control glare, improve daylighting and  maintain thermal performance. Although granular aerogel is not fragile like monolithic aerogel, it might  be good practice to keep the operable portions of the windows with the conventional glazing as  opposed of aerogel to prevent premature deterioration. A good example of this practice is the Detroit  School of Arts (Midtown Detroit, Michigan, USA).  The decision on the percent coverage or the scheme comes from the designers and can be done in a  multitude of ways. For more traditional styles such as the New England style, the individual squares can  be configured to be with aerogel while others are clear as was discussed by (Berardi, Development of  Glazing Systems with Silica Aerogel, 2015a). For a more contemporary design, an execution such the  sculpture building in Yale or Nobel Halls Student Residence & Activity Center at SUNY Stony Brook (New  York, USA). Regardless, granular aerogel glazing is versatile and can be incorporated into a multitude of  designs to fit the projects' needs.

6 CONCLUSIONS 
  Silica aerogel is still considered to be in its experimental/trial phase for building applications. Based on  existing research, it is suggested that due to the extraordinary properties of silica aerogel it should be  widely adopted for building applications. The majority of research to date has been focused on either  the improvement of performance or synthesis cost reductions in predominately pristine condition. One  of the prerequisites for a material or product to gain wide spread usage in the construction industry  aside from raw performance, is the need for a proven track record i.e. good durability. Durability data,  or how well the performance is maintained over a given time period can be a long process if done  naturally, but by using accelerated ageing, the span of years can be condensed into a few months.  Fenestrations are generally considered the weakest points in the thermal envelope and glazing  specifically has a dual function where it has to provide views/daylight and thermal resistance. Aerogel's  unique properties with its translucent skeletal structure and low thermal conductivity could be the  perfect combination to address both functions. Silica aerogel comes in two formats, monolithic and  granular. Monolithic silica being superior in both optical and thermal performance and is the better  choice for glazing applications, but it is also very brittle, difficult to manufacture and expensive making it  difficult to obtain. As a consequence to this, granular aerogel was used in glazing units to test the optical  and thermal performance before and after accelerated ageing in various climatic conditions.  Two sets of IGUs were built and filled with aerogel (Cabot P300 and Airglass), the smaller variety  (10x10cm) were used for optical testing in the spectrophotometer (which supports a maximum size of  12x12cm), while the larger ones (30x30cm) were used for thermal testing in the heat flow meter. The  larger units were aged in the oven (elevated temperatures) and temperature cycling machine (freeze  thaw cycles) for 4 months (equivalent to 21 and 13.5 years respectively). The smaller units were aged in  climatic chamber (UV, elevated temperature and high humidity) and humidity chambers for 3 and 2  months (equivalent to 74 and 13.5 years respectively).  The Uvalue for center of glass (CoG) showed a 14% increase after the accelerated ageing with one unit  even showing a slight improvement (decrease). This is a very slight decrease indicating great durability  on the thermal performance end. For a span of 20 years this type of performance drop would be  equivalent to a few hundred dollars for single detached family house in Canada while a 3600m2 office  would have to several hundred dollars extra, neither of which are significant enough for that time span.  The actual Uvalue of the units ranged from 1.51.8 (W/m2K) (for both pristine and aged conditions)  which is slightly higher than Cabot's own Lumira granular aerogel which has 1.38 W/m2K.   The visible transmittance of all the units is quite low (>10%) which is due to the lack of an integrating  sphere which could catch all the scattering caused by the granular aerogel. Generally granular aerogel,  depending on the thickness and opacity, is expected to be in the range of 3070%. After the accelerated  ageing, the units in the climatic chamber saw a maximum of 5% decrease to the average visible  transmittance while the units aged in the humidity chambers saw up to 111% decrease in transmittance  indicating that moisture causing silica network breakage.  None the less, granular aerogel glazing, when manufactured commercially has been used successfully in  many buildings to provide roughly equivalent thermal performance to more traditional double and triple  glazed glazing. While on the optical end, granular aerogel fills a more niche role as a great material for  61   

large glazed facades where a combination of privacy, daylighting and glare control is needed, where it  excels.  It is important to note that in both sets of ageing, shrinking of the aerogel inside of the IGUs was noticed  which can be combated by proper compaction during the manufacturing process. Also, a slightly  abnormal phenomena was noticed with the granules that were aged in the oven where they shrunk  quite significantly, but after equalize in room temperature and shaking of the IGU, the aerogel returned  to its original volume. Also, some discoloration of particles was noticed among several of the aged units  for both types of aerogel (Cabot P300 and Airglass). Although the discoloration did not have much of an  impact on thermal performance, but for optical performance it might be a more of factor especially  when considering the entire panel and not just the center which where the spectrophotometer  measures. It is common practice to use frosted or translucent glass in combination with granular aerogel  which maintains the aesthetic quality of the assembly even if some discoloration maybe occur over the  lifespan of the building.  Overall granular aerogel demonstrated to have great durability and a relatively long time would be  needed to observe the changes described in natural outdoor conditions. A few things can be done to  guarantee the long term performance of a granular aerogel glazing. Controlling moisture penetration  into the IGU would be critical and can be done through a combination of factors such as tightness of  assembly and use of desiccant. When the assembly is designed with the precautions to moisture, the  reduction in performance would be even smaller and the energy performance of the building can be  maintained for a long service life. The granular aerogel can even be combined with various lowE  coatings, and gas fills to further increase performance making it an attractive material for future  research and investigations.

7 RECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
  Granular aerogel has a lot of potential for both opaque and transparent applications for the building  industry. A lot of the research that been already completed is focused mostly on the pristine  performance of granular aerogel IGUs. Studying the performance of the aged AGUs would prove very  valuable to help understand which ageing mechanism or combination of mechanisms and in which  configuration is the most harmful for the long term performance. This would help guide the synthesis,  assembly and product selection to be optimized for both pristine and long term performance of the  granular aerogel glazing.  The number of identical samples should be increased to at least three to provide more comprehensive  results where the probability of abnormalities is reduced. Asphaug et al. (2015) used 3 identical units for  each variation of the experiment which helped increase the statistical significance of the results. The  importance of a bigger sample pool size i.e. statistical significance, is to prove that he selected sample is  indeed representative of the whole population and that the resulting measurements are not due to  abnormalities or sampling error.  For thermal conductance measurements the increased samples to 3 per single variation would be  sufficient to reach the significance level. Since an apparatus such as the flow meter does multiple  measurements across multiple temperatures which could take up to 12 hours for 8 set points, repeating  the measurement after flipping the IGU would provide little value since the cross section of the glass  and granules through which the heat moves would still be the same. For visible transmittance  measurements, changing the orientation could have an effect on the measurements since the tested  cross section is small. Each test in the spectrophotometer is quite short (510min long for 2002000nm)  so it can be repeated multiple times for each sample by changing the orientation of the sample. The  optical measurements could be the average of 5 measurements per units as was done by Asphaug et al.  (2015).   The effects of accelerated ageing on various compaction level, aerogel granules type and size would be  useful research area. Since there is an optimal compaction level as mentioned by Neugebaur et al.  (2014) for pristine thermal performance, there should be an optimal compaction level for AGUs with  taking into account aged performance. This can be repeated for various granules sizes since each size  category could have a different requirement. The type of aerogel granules, excluding size differences,  can be also studied to see how much of a difference there is between something like Cabot's P300  particles that are officially not marketed for glazing vs. Lumira particles are that meant for glazing  applications. The emphasis of a study like that would be the comparison in pristine, aged, thermal and  optical performance but with emphasis in terms of cost and ease of manufacturing to see if there indeed  any real differences or is it just marketing propaganda.  The shrinking of the aerogel volume in the cavity that was observed for most of the units was consistent  with the results by Gao et al. (2014), but unit 9 which showed very significant shrinking was able to  regain some its volume after cooling down and shaking of the IGU. The temporary shrinking of the  aerogel volume due to constant high temperature is a research topic for material sciences either from  civil engineering or chemistry fields since it would involve deep understanding and studying of the  properties on a molecular level and would be outside of the knowledge base for building science.  63   

The second aspect of aerogel granular shrinking is also an opportunity for research but it split into two  portions. The first type of research is on which mechanisms create what size of gap in the aerogel. This  would include a combination between granular type, thickness and compaction and how each one of  those is affected by various ageing mechanisms, i.e. how quickly and how big of they create. This  research would also quantify the reduction in thermal performance for the IGUs due to the created gap  size. The second type of research would deal with material sciences for the optimization of synthesis of  the granular aerogel but also the assembly itself. This would help establish guidelines as to how  eliminate the air gap either through better assembly or creating a better aerogel granular. Having an air  gap in the aerogel fill reduces the thermal performance significantly since the air would be 3.5 more  conductive than the aerogel fill.  This research was focused on the aged performance of the aerogel with a very basic assembly. Another  research topic that could be of value is how the granular aerogel ages when combined with different  types of glass and coatings. This would allow to see the changes to optical and thermal performance of  the AGUs but also will allow to see if there are issues or potential benefits to combining aerogel with  coatings/films and various glass types. Maybe there would be less discoloration of the particles or  damage to the coating due to contact with aerogel particles.   At their current state, at double glazed glazing thicknesses, AGUs have roughly equivalent thermal  performance to double glazed IGUs with argon and coatings. The annual energy savings for buildings  would be quite small and not significant enough to study more than already existing research. On the  other hand, daylighting simulation for glare control, could be quite useful to see if and by how much a  given space can be improved by incorporating various configuration of AGUs in the faÃ§ade. This would  provide information as to the feasibility for existing buildings to upgrade their windows and potentially  include a mix of IGUs and AGUs.
