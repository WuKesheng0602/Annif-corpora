Abstract
Climate change forecasts project up to 20% increase in precipitation for southern Ontario based on several climate change scenarios and models and an unpredictable change an average wind speed that may range from 5% reduction to 15% increase by the year 2100 compared to 1971 to 2000 reference period. Average annual air temperatures are predicted to increase between 2.5 and 3.7°C by 2050 from baseline average between 1961 and 1990. This research studied the impact of climate change on bridge infrastructure using the Portage bridge on the Ottawa river in southern Ontario as a case study. Result shows that increase in precipitation due to climate change will cause 0.3m/s increase in stream velocity and about 0.85m increase in water level for a 100-year storm. This increase will result in scour depths at bridge piers to increase by 0.86 m while bending moments on piers increased by 21 kNm. Shear forces also increased by 43 kN.

1 Introduction
River bridges are a critical component of transport networks; therefore, the functionality and sustainability of river bridges will have a significant effect on the social, economic and physical development of the society. Infrastructural systems such as bridges often form the core foundation of many aspects of modern society such as economy and quality of life. In the last century, there has been a significant change in weather patterns across different zones of the world. This shift is termed climate change.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), established by the United Nations (the world's most authoritative and recognized body of climate change research) has released several assessment reports on climate change impact to all zones of the world and made predictions on how climate change will affect different zones of the world (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007) According to predictions, climate change will have both detrimental and advantageous effects. Harmful consequences of climate change which are already being noticed include; sea level rise, global temperature rise, warming ocean, shrinking ice sheet, declining Arctic ice ocean acidification and an increase in the frequency of extreme events. Of noteworthy is the increase in the severity of extreme events apart from their increased frequency. (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007). One of the strategies to reduce the vulnerability of infrastructures to these changes is to anticipate and adapt. Before any meaningful adaptation studies and strategies can be implemented for infrastructures, a clear understanding of the process and impact of climate change is required. Although a lot of studies have been conducted by researchers generally on climate change, most of the available studies concentrated on causes, impact and mitigation methods with few studies done on the adaptation of infrastructures to climate change. Climate change requires a focus on both slowing climate change, that is, mitigation and adapting to the anticipated impacts of it. Adaptation, however, has not received as much attention from researchers as much as mitigations. (Blanco and Alberti, 2009).

The anticipated impact of climate change which would directly or indirectly affect bridge infrastructure by an increase in environmental loading and degradation mechanism and rate of which the materials with which infrastructures are built are, carbonation, chloride penetration, sulfate attacks, alkali aggregate reactions, precipitation depending on region and increase in storm surges. (flooding). There have been studies investigating all these phenomena as discrete occurrences but they have mostly not been investigated in the context of climate change. These studies did not investigate the mechanisms of these phenomena and climate change interactions. Yin-hui, et al. (2015) investigated the effect of water flow pressure on bridge piers. They also studied the scour associated with water pressure on bridge piers. Cheng, (2012) evaluated the Lateral behavior of Pile-supported Bridges under scouring conditions. Stewart, Wang, and Nguyen, (2011) however, investigated Climate change impact and risks of concrete infrastructure deterioration. In the area of adapting infrastructures to climate change impacts, very few studies have been carried out and these studies mostly explored strategic management adaptations regarding policy changes that can be implemented by government agencies and policy makers. Structural adaptations to the physical infrastructure itself were seldom discussed. Buurman and Babovic, (2016) discussed the uncertainty in policy making for adaptation to climate change and proposed several approaches for quantifying and dealing with these uncertainties. Demuzere, et al., (2014) advocated adaptation on a holistic societal scale through green urban infrastructure development and averred that green urban infrastructure directly mitigates climate change and adapt the environment since it directly removes CO2 from the atmosphere via photosynthetic uptake during the day and releases CO2 at night via respiration. The big question however is; how do we adapt individual existing infrastructure to climate change in terms of structural capacity and user's safety since these structures will be exposed to new loading in scales and patterns that were non-existence as at the time of design and construction? How do we also adapt future (yet to be built) infrastructure to climate change as our existing codes and standards were formulated mostly for past climate? These questions require answers especially since resources are limited, and all existing infrastructures can't be rebuilt.

1.1 Objective and Scope
The overall goal is to investigate the structural impact of climate change on river bridge infrastructure using a bridge on the Ottawa River as a case study and to demonstrate the utilization of the finite element modelling and analysis to investigate the response of the bridge and how the bridge can be adapted to the structural impacts of climate change. These objectives were achieved by: · Apply the HecRas tool to simulate precipitation and water level changes in the future climate based on selected climate scenarios (HecRas is a computer program that models the hydraulics of water flow through natural rivers and other channels); · · · · · Simulate historical and future data for the Ottawa river by calibrating the HecRas model for the river and basin; Compare simulation of past scenarios to historical data as a verification for simulations of future scenarios; Apply the HecRas tool to estimate the scour at the base of the bridge pier; Apply the tool to estimate the river flow velocity at the location of the bridge; Use the finite element software STAAD.PRO to analyze the bridge and investigate the bridge response to different climate change impact based on the results of scour depth, water level, and flow velocities; · · Study the effect of climate change on existing structures whose strength has been affected due to age, use and exposure conditions; and Discuss adaptive retrofits to the bridge.

1.2 Organization of the Thesis
Following the introduction, chapter 2 reviews the literature on adapting infrastructure to climate change. The present body of knowledge and research was explored. Climate change scenarios and models were looked into and mechanism of climate change impact on bridge infrastructures was discussed. Material deterioration was discussed in terms of carbonation, chloride penetration, sulfate attacks and freeze thaw effects. Structural impact of climate change was also discussed. Factors that will impact the structural integrity of bridges such as flooding and it attendant hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loading as well as scour effect of flooding on the bridge piers is discussed. 3

Chapter 3 describes the methodology employed in the current research. In chapter 4, results were discussed. Axial forces, bending moments and reinforcement requirements for the present climate and the projected future climate were compared. Chapter discussed conclusions to present study and looked at recommendations to adapt to climate change and suggested future studies.

2 Literature Review
2.1 Climate Change
Climate refers to the average weather conditions prevailing in an area over a long period of time. In statistical terms, it may be described as the mean and variability of atmospheric variables such as temperature, precipitation, wind and humidity over a period of time, which can range from months to centuries. The averaging period for estimating these variables is usually 30 years. (IPCC, 2014). However, Rood (2007) averred that climate is much more than weather and atmosphere, He stated that climate involves contributions of other components of the earth system such as the cryosphere, ocean, land and their chemical state including the sun and the geological state of the earth which are significant contributors to climate. He also hinted that the averaging period of 30 years used in defining climate is dependent on the quality and completeness of observed records which might be inadequate since extended data record shows an important mode of variabilities longer than 30 years, especially the non-atmospheric components. "Climate change in IPCC usage refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g. using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer." (IPCC, 2014). Environment and natural resources Canada defines "climate change as a long-term shift in weather conditions identified by changes in temperature, precipitation, winds, and other indicators. Climate change can involve both changes in average conditions and changes in variability, including, for example, extreme events" (Environment and natural resources Canada, 2015).

2.2 Causes of Climate change
The causes of climate change can best be explained concerning earth energy balance or energy factors. The earth's temperature is regulated by outgoing and incoming energy and any factor that that causes a sustained disruption to the amount of outgoing or incoming energy causes climate change. Because these factors are external to the earth system, they are referred to as `climate forcers' to create the impression that they push the climate towards a new state. The new state can

5

be cooler or warmer depending on the climate forces. Causes of climate change can be broadly categorized into natural and human causes.

2.2.1 Natural Causes
Climate can be affected by natural occurrences that are external to the earth's climatic system. These may include changes in the sun's solar output and volcanic activities

2.2.2 Human Causes
Human causes refer to climate forces that are caused by human activities. The primary cause is burning of fossil fuels and deforestation as a direct result of logging for timber and clearing for agriculture and development and results in the release of greenhouse gasses, mainly carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and water vapor. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) are another major greenhouse gas contributing to climate change by reacting with and destroying the ozone layer. The United Nations has acknowledged that present climate change is happening due to human caused factors (Fung et al., 2011). Figure 2.1 shows the rate of increase in greenhouse gases for 2000 years. It can be deduced that the industrial revolution heralded the sharp increase in a number of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Figure 2.2 also shows the increment in CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere from 1960.

2.3 Climate Models
Climate models are used to study the effect of higher greenhouse gases in the atmosphere based on increasing amounts of heat that is trapped in the atmosphere. Increased heat affects all aspects of weather and climate, which includes precipitation, winds, and humidity. Lots of global climate models have been developed with each one being unique, based on different assumptions and each one produces different projections of future climate when the same data (scenarios) are provided as inputs. The intergovernmental panel on climate change has developed several climate models to analyze and project what the future climate would likely be. These models development has witnessed several fine-tuning as technology improves and can be said to be generational. These models are called Global climate models or General circulation models (GCMs). A global climate model also called a general circulation model intends to predict climate behavior by integrating a variety of fluid-dynamical, chemical, or biological equations that are either derived from physical laws or constructed by empirical means. GCMs have been developed for both the atmosphere, that is atmospheric GCMs (AGCMs) and the ocean, that is ocean GCMs (OGCMs). An AGCM and an OGCM can be combined (coupled) together to form an atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation model (AOGCM). Other components such as a sea ice model or a land model are added, and this AOGCM becomes the basis for a full climate model. This allows for different variations and their varying degrees of response to climate change can be studied.

2.3.1 Regional Climate Models and Dynamic Downscaling
GCMs depict the world climate using a three-dimensional grid over the global space, and the grids typically have a horizontal resolution of between 250 and 600 km, 10 to 20 vertical layers in the atmosphere and may have as many as 30 layers in the oceans. This resolution is quite coarse relative to the scale of exposure units in most impact assessments, therefore only partially fulfilling criteria of GCM developments. (IPCC, 2017). Many physical processes, such as those related to clouds occur at smaller scales than the GCMs resolutions and cannot be adequately modeled using the GCMs. Instead, their known properties are averaged over the larger scale using a technique

8

known as parameterization. This creates a source of uncertainty in GCM based simulations of future climate. Also, in the simulation of feedback mechanisms in models relating to water vapor and warming, clouds and radiation, ocean circulation, ice and snow albedo which occur at scales smaller than the resolutions of GCMs, results of future climate simulations obtained are marred with a high level of uncertainties. Because of these, GCMs may simulate quite different responses to the same forcing because of the way certain processes and feedbacks are modelled. (IPCC, 2017) In other to solve the problems of uncertainty created by too large resolutions of GCMs, Improved information on regional climate change can be achieved with the use of different regionalization techniques, including high-resolution and variable resolution (Jacob, et al., 2007). This results in Regional Climate Models (RCMs). RCMs are therefore GCMs that has been dynamically downscaled to produce models of higher resolutions. Dynamical downscaling is basically the method used to obtain high-resolution climate or climate change information from coarse-resolution global climate models (GCMs) which does not adequately capture the effects of local and regional forcing in areas with complex surface physiography. GCMs are run at a spatial resolution of 150-300 km by 150-300 km and are unable to resolve important sub-grid scale features such as clouds and topography. Many impacts models require information at scales of 50 km or less for proper analysis. Hence several downscaling methods are developed to estimate the smaller-scale information. Dynamical downscaling uses limited-area, high-resolution model (a regional climate model, or RCM) driven by boundary conditions from a GCM to derive smaller-scale information which cannot be adequately derived from global climate models, GCMs, (IPCC, 2017)

2.3.2 Canadian Climate Models
Canada and Canadian climate scientists have not been left out in the development of global climate models and regional climate models. The Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma) has developed a number of climate models. These climate models are used to study climate change and its variability and to understand the various processes which govern the climate system. They are also used to make quantitative projections of future long-term climate change 9

given various greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing scenarios and increasingly to make initialized climate predictions on time scales ranging from seasons to decades. (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2017) Climate models developed by the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma) includes the current and previous models.

2.3.2.1 Current models
Climate models developed and currently in use by Canadian climate reseachers include the following (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2017) CanESM2 CGCM4/CanCM4 AGCM4/CanAM4 CGCM3 AGCM3 The second generation Canadian Earth System Model The fourth generation and current coupled global climate model The fourth generation and current atmospheric general circulation model The third generation coupled global climate model The third generation atmospheric general circulation model

2.4 Climate Change Scenarios
Future levels of greenhouse gas in itself are not certain and are therefore modeled based on scenarios, which describe different ways in which the world may develop in the next 100 years. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has approved 40 scenarios which may be used in assessments of climate change and its impacts. The scenario has a different set of assumptions about future environmental, social and economic conditions. The real amount of greenhouse gas in the future will depend on variable factors such as global population, human behavior, 10

technological development, carbon source, the behavior of land and water ecosystems. No scenario is more likely to occur than others, therefore none of the scenarios represent a "best guess" of future emission. The intergovernmental panel on climate change further grouped these 40 emission scenarios into four (4) distinct families as described below:

2.4.1 A1 Family
The A1 scenarios are of a more integrated world. The A1 family of scenarios is characterized by Rapid economic growth. A global population that reaches 9 billions in 2050 and then gradually declines. The quick spread of new and efficient technologies. A convergent world - income and way of life converge between regions. Extensive social and cultural interactions worldwide. There are subsets to the A1 family based on their technological emphasis: A1FI - An emphasis on fossil-fuels (Fossil Intensive). A1B - A balanced emphasis on all energy sources.

The B2 scenarios are characterized by: (a) Continuously increasing population, but at a slower rate than in A2 (b) Emphasis on local rather than global solutions to economic, social and environmental stability (c) Intermediate levels of economic development and (d) Less rapid and more fragmented technological change than in A1 and B1. (IPCC, 2014).

2.5 Climate Change in Canada
Canadian scientists have studied climate change over the last two decades. Various federal government agencies, the provincial government, city councils and industry have sponsored a series of researches related to climate change, its impacts, mitigation, and adaptations. However, these studies are scattered around these different agencies and make them somewhat difficult to access. Examples of these studies include "The impact of climate change on Canadian municipalities infrastructure," "Changing weather patterns, uncertainty, and infrastructure risks: Emerging adaptation requirements", "Climate change for Ontario: an updated synthesis for policy makers and planners", "Adapting infrastructure to climate change in Canadian cities and communities", "Cities and communities: The changing climate and increasing vulnerability", "Canadian climate trends, 1950 to 2007" and "Temperature and precipitation trends in Canada during the 20th century". These studies were performed to try to understand the observed climate changes, it causes and to project future trends. Major results of climate trends in Canada and future projections may be summarized as follows:

2.5.1 Surface air temperature
Zhang et al. (2010) studied temperature trends using data from 210 stations scattered across the country over a period from 1950 to 2007. These data were rigorously checked and corrected for known sources of systematic error such as station shifts, changes in procedures used for observation and excluded stations where there were high urban warming effects. (Zhang, et al.,

12

2010). The daily mean temperature was then computed from the average daily maximum and minimum temperatures. From the studies, they concluded that the mean daily temperatures across Canada showed a significant increase in most regions. Within the time studied, annual mean temperature has increased by about 1.4oC. (Zhang et al., 2010). This increase differs from zone to zone as shown in Figure 2.3, the largest increase was observed in northwestern and western region with lowest in eastern Canada.

Figure 2.3 Change in mean annual temperature in Canada, from 1950 to2007 (Zhang et al., 2010)

These results agree with results obtained by several other researchers like Bonsal et al. (2000), Chiotti and Lavender (2008). Historical trends show that the average annual global temperature warmed by about 0.76°C over the last century (IPCC 2007a:5), but warming in Canada was double the world average. The average temperature in Canada has increased about 1.2°C in the last 58 years (Environment Canada, 2006). The warming was not uniform across the country. For example, average annual temperatures increased about 2°C in northwestern British Columbia and the Kluane region of the Yukon Territory, and by 1.2°C in south-central Canada, but did not change

13

in Atlantic Canada (Environment Canada, 2006). During this period, temperatures across Ontario increased 0 to 1.4°C (Chiotti and Lavender, 2008). Seasonal trends have also been studied, change in temperature differs from one season to another as shown in Figures 2.4 - 2.7. Warming trends are more frequently observed in winter and spring, with more warming concentrated over western Canada. Some evidence of cooling was observed in the fall, but these were not significant (Zhang et al. 2010). The only stations showing significant fall trends are warming over northern Canada. Similarly, in summer the only significant trends are warming, and these stations tend to be located in southern Canada. Analyses of daily temperature extremes indicate trends consistent with warming including fewer cold nights, cold days, and frost days, but more frequent warm nights and warm days. (Vincent and Mekis, 2006). Zhang et al. (2010) found evidence that increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases from human activities were contributing to temperature increases in Canada.

Future projections for temperature in Canada have been studied. Figure 2.8 shows the result of simulations by The Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma) when they simulated and projected the likely change in mean surface air temperature (°C) in Canada in 20412060 relative to 1941-1960 as simulated by CGCM3/T47 in the IPCC SRES A1B experiment. Figure 2.9 shows the projections for the same period while using the IPCC SRES B1 scenario.

2.5.2 Precipitation
Zhang et al. (2010) showed that precipitation had increased over Canada since 1950 when he studied data from 210 different weather stations. The majority of stations with significant trends showing increases as shown in Figure 2.10. The increasing trend is most obvious over northern Canada where many stations show significant increases. There is not much evidence of clear regional patterns in stations showing significant changes in seasonal precipitation except for significant decreases which tend to be concentrated in the winter season over southwestern and southeastern Canada. Also, increasing precipitation over the Arctic appears to be occurring in all seasons except summer. The trend toward increasing precipitation has been accompanied by increases in extreme daily precipitation amounts during the growing season (Qian et al., 2010).

17

Figure 2.10 Precipitation trends over Canada from 1950 to 2007 (Zhang et al., 2010)

Trends in the annual number of days with measurable precipitation have a similar pattern to trends in total annual precipitation but with larger numbers of stations showing significant increases and decreases. This is particularly evident in summer where significant increases in the number of days with precipitation were observed over most regions of Canada (Zhang et al., 2010). Zhang et al. (2010) reported that it is difficult to generalize a spatial pattern in precipitation trends apart from a tendency for stations with significant increases in precipitation amount and the number of days with precipitation to be located over southern coastal and northern regions of Canada. While it is not yet clear what is responsible for the precipitation changes in Canada, a recent study found evidence of anthropogenic influences in observed precipitation increases over Northern Hemispheric land areas north of 55°N including Canada (Min et al., 2008). Projections for future precipitation in Canada as simulated by the CCCma shows that annual and seasonal precipitations are likely to increase across Canada for all the simulated SRES scenarios, with the greatest increase in northwest Canada.

2.6 Historical Climate and Projected Changes for Ontario
Scientists have studied Ontario's historical climate and have projected future climate using Canadian regional climate models as well as global climate models. Chiotti and Lavander (2008) projected the seasonal changes in mean temperature in the 2050's compared with 1961 to 199 0 based on a median of seven global climate models (GCMs) and SRES A1F1 to B2. Ontario climate is changing and will witness an increase in mean temperature and precipitation in the coming decades. (Chiotti & Lavender, 2008) Temperature increases in Ontario were significant in several locations during the 20th century. For example, the average annual temperature near Belleville in Ontario on the north shore of Lake Ontario has increased by 1.14°C since 1921 (Lemieux et al. 2007). In northwestern Ontario, east of Sioux Lookout, the average annual temperature has increased by 1.19°C since 1930. Significant warming in northeastern Ontario has also occurred. Since 1938, the average annual temperature 20

north of Sudbury has increased by 1.14°C, and along the James Bay coastline, the average annual temperature has increased 1.24°C since 1895 (Lemieux et al. 2007). Warming has been more significant in winter and spring and is believed to have contributed to changes in evaporation rates, less snowfall, more rainfall, and shorter periods with ice cover (Lemieux et al. 2005, Vincent and Mekis 2005). Figure 2.14 shows projected annual temperature difference between 1971 and 2000 and 2071-2100 following the A2 scenario for Ontario.

Figure 2.14 Projected change in average annual temperature in Ontario in 2071 to 2100 compared to 1971 ­ 2000 using the A2 scenario in the Canadian Coupled Global Climate model. (Colombo et al, 2007)

Precipitation has also been on the increase in Ontario in the past decades, Colombo et al. (2007) reported that even though winter season precipitation is on a reducing trend, warm season precipitation and average annual precipitation will increase by up to 20% by 2071 to 2100 compared to 1971 to 2000 for the investigated scenarios.

2.7 Climate Change and Infrastructure
Researchers over the years have recognized the impacts of climate change on infrastructures and emphasized the need to evaluate the severity of the infrastructure vulnerability and impacts. Research has also shown that threats are posed to both existing and future infrastructures. The current and potential impacts of climate change on infrastructure include both beneficial and detrimental effects (Research & Analysis Division Infrastructure Canada, 2006). Flooding is an example of detrimental effects, which causes scouring and in some cases, total bridge washouts. (Wright et al, 2012) evaluated the impact of climate change on bridge performance associated with climate change and submitted that although many bridges are already vulnerable to scour, incremental vulnerability is caused because of climate change. With building infrastructures, material deterioration and flooding are of major concern, concrete, steel and wood that are the main materials for building infrastructure are sensitive to climate change. More carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a problem to reinforced concrete whose deterioration may occur as a direct result of carbonation. Atmospheric humidity will impact steel buildings in terms of corrosion rate while the wood structures and products will rot in moist environments. Overall, climate change will cause the rate of material deterioration to be exacerbated.

2.8 Climate Change Impact and Risk Assessment For Civil Infrastructure
Before any meaningful discussion can be carried out on climate change adaptation, a risk assessment framework must be developed. This helps in assessing vulnerabilities and impending hazards that adaptation measures are implemented as a mitigation strategy. It is imperative to assess the risk of climate change impact on each particular type of infrastructure. These risks assessment may be defined or carried out based on:

2.8.1 Extreme Events Risk Assessment
This requires an assessment of extreme events that may occur due to climate change and its impacts. According to intergovernmental panel on climate change reports, the following extreme climate changes are expected: drought periods increase, the extreme hot temperature increase in 22

intensity and temporal occurrence, the number of days of heat wave increase, extreme precipitation increase in intensity, the number of days with snowfall decrease. Moreover, extreme events: forest fires, flooding, ground movements, temporary sea flooding, biodiversity (avifauna corridors evolutions, algal blooms in waterways), etc., are likely to evolve. (Marie et al, 2016). A list of these extreme events should be made and scores assigned to them based on intensity and frequency of occurrence.

2.8.2 Physical Vulnerability Risk Assessment
This is a physical assessment based on factors such as the age of the infrastructure, materials, expected lifetime, design rules or localization. It is also of importance to consider extreme events the infrastructure has faced in the past for existing infrastructures. A scoring regime should be developed for this assessment. Physical vulnerability should consider both ultimate and serviceability limits of failure of the specific infrastructure.

2.8.3 Functional Vulnerability Risk Assessment
Civil infrastructure supports different types of functionalities, for example, transportation infrastructure supports crucial functionalities such as rescue services, firemen or police access, evacuation of persons; accessibility functionalities, such as food and health centers and common functionalities such as goods and passengers common transport services (Marie et al, 2016) Functional vulnerability refers to the loss of functionality that may occur in the event of an extreme weather event. Functional vulnerability risk assessment is the analysis of the expected impacts on services that would be affected, for example, destruction of a hospital access road may not directly cause death but the delay in reaching a health facility due to detours may cause death, or permanent disabilities. Extreme climate event's impact on functionalities of transport network will include degradation of the quality of service, capacity, increase in cost and time and even vehicle deterioration.

23

2.8.4 Total risk assessment
The total risk assessment is determined by the combination of risk scores of the extreme events, functional vulnerabilities, and physical vulnerabilities. This risk level or score forms the baseline or metrics on which adaptation strategies are developed. Each type of risk assessment should be carried out using a risk matrix as shown in Figure 2.15. Each extreme event should be analyzed. The risk for a particular event is the product of the probability of occurrence and the severity. Immediate adaptation strategies must be developed for events with high-risk values.

Figure 2.15 Typical risk matrix for an extreme event scenario

2.9 Mechanism of Climate Change Impact on Bridge Infrastructure
Climate change will affect transport infrastructure and bridge infrastructure in particular by exacerbating the standard bridge deterioration mechanisms, and these include material deterioration and structural failures due to increased loadings. These mechanisms will include carbonation, chloride penetration which ultimately leads to corrosion of steel and scouring which undermines the integrity of the bridge foundation. Most river bridges are constructed with materials such as steel, concrete and wood either in combinations as composite as in reinforced and pre-stressed concrete bridges or as stand-alone as 24

in steel and wooden bridges. All these materials react to elements of climate and will be impacted by change in climate since their designs and construction are based on inputs which includes climate characteristics such as temperature, relative humidity and atmospheric pollution. Corrosion, a widespread cause of deterioration in bridges containing steel causes material loss and if not treated, increasing corrosion damage may lead to reduced safety, premature in-service failures as well as altered structural behavior and failure modes (Kallias and Imam, 2013). Exposure design conditions of these structures are directly dependent on climate parameters and a change in these exposure conditions will cause changes in deterioration process.

2.9.1 Carbonation-Induced Corrosion
Carbonation is a phenomenon, which occurs in concrete as a result of the dissolution of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the concrete pore fluid to form carbonic acid (H2CO3). This reacts with calcium from calcium hydroxide and calcium silicate hydrate present in the concrete to form calcium carbonate (CaCO3). CO2 + H2O  H2CO3 H2CO3 + Ca(OH)2  CaCO3 + 2H2O (2.1) (2.2)

The presence of Ca(OH)2 in concrete gives it a PH value of about 12.5. The highly alkaline environment of concrete creates a protective, passivating oxide layer around steel when present in the concrete protecting the reinforcement from corrosion. Carbonation of concrete reduces a concrete's pH to a value less than 9, which w eakens, or could even eliminate the steel's protective layer and herald the process of corrosion. It should be noted that carbonation gradually propagates from the concrete surface towards the reinforcement and when carbonation depth equals the concrete cover, corrosion of the reinforcement starts. Carbonation depth depends on many parameters such as concrete quality, concrete cover, relative humidity, ambient carbon dioxide concentration and others. Many researchers have studied the impact of carbonation and various mathematical models have been developed with the purpose of predicting carbonation depths. Stewart, et al. (2011) showed that climate change, which is associated with increased level of carbon di-oxide in the atmosphere and increased atmospheric temperatures effectively accelerates the deterioration of concretes containing steel reinforcements. 25

Figure 2.16 shows a section of a reinforced concrete structure that is undergoing degradation by corrosion and spalling induced by carbonation

Figure 2.16 Corrosion and spalling induced by carbonation (Xiaoming et al. 2010)

2.9.2 Chloride-induced Corrosion
Steel bars used as reinforcement in concrete are covered by a thin passive layer of oxide that protects them from oxygen and water, which causes corrosion and the production of rust when they get to the steel, as shown in Figure 2.17. This passive layer can only be maintained at an alkaline pH values i.e. pH>12 or at a chloride ion content less than a corrosion threshold. When chloride ions penetrate the concrete and then accumulate to a critical level on the surface of steel reinforcement, the protective layer is destroyed in a process known as de-passivation. (Xiaoming, et al, 2010). This causes an electrochemical cell to be formed. Figure 2.17 shows the Electrochemical cell at rebar surface induced by chloride penetration.

26

Figure 2.17 Electrochemical cell at rebar surface induced by chloride penetration (Xiaoming et al., 2010) The chemical reactions for chloride-induced corrosion at the steel surface involves the following reaction as shown by Xiaoming, et al. (2010). Fe++ + 2Cl­  FeCl2 FeCl2 + 2H2O  Fe(OH)2 + 2HCl (2.3) (2.4)

The de-passivated area becomes an anode, while the passivated surface becomes a cathode. At the anode of the cell, the reaction is described by: Fe  Fe++ + 2e­ Fe++ + 2(OH)­  Fe(OH)2 4Fe(OH)2 + 2H2O + O2  4Fe(OH)3 and the reaction at the cathode is given by: 4e­ + O2 + 2H2O  4(OH)­ (2.8) (2.5) (2.6) (2.7)

During the corrosion process, two major rust and corrosion products are Fe(OH)2 (ferrous hydroxide) and Fe(OH)3 (ferric hydroxide).

27

Figure 2.18 Corrosion of steel reinforcement in concrete Structures (Xiaoming et al., 2010) Chlorides induced corrosion depends on three main factors which are diffusion coefficient of concrete, surface chloride concentration and critical chloride level beyond which corrosion of reinforcement will be initiated. (Xiaoming, et al. 2010). The coefficient of diffusion depends on the microstructure of the concrete. Climate change will hence speed up chloride-induced corrosion as it is associated with increased carbon dioxide and carbonation which affects the concrete micro structure. Saeki (2002) studied the effect of carbonation on chloride penetration of concrete and submitted that chloride penetrated is accelerated in carbonated concrete.

2.9.3 Scouring
Scouring refers to the erosion of bed material around structures such as abutments and piers caused by water flowing around the structure. It occurs when more sediment material is transported out of an area than into it. Bridge piers or other obstacles that obstruct the flow and cause a change to the flow field initiate the scouring process. The material on the bed and banks of a river erodes when the drag and uplift forces from the flow exceed those of gravity on the bed materials, friction

28

and cohesion. The depth and extent of scour depends on many factors such as the water flow, size and shape of the obstruction and type of sediment material. Different materials erode at varying speeds. it will take longer for a cohesive soil to erode than for a loose granular soil due to cohesive and Van der Waal forces, but the final scour depth can be the same in both types of soils (Chase and Holnbeck, 2004).

The total scour at a bridge consists of three components; long-term aggradation and degradation, general scour and local scour. With climate change, increased precipitation intensity and extremes, which is usually associated with flooding is bound to increase scouring at bridge foundations and jeopardizing the stability of bridges.

2.9.3.1 Clear-Water and Live Bed Scour
The two different types of sediment transport mechanisms are clear-water and live-bed scour. Clearwater scour occurs when there is no transportation of sediment from upstream of the bridge or the sediment being transported remains in suspension and is not deposited into the scour-hole. Live-bed scour, also known as continuous sediment transport scour, occurs when sediment material is being transported into the area from upstream during the scour process. The equilibrium state is dynamic, and the scour depth oscillates non-periodically as bed material is being transported in and out of the scour hole. The equilibrium state for this type of sediment transportation is reached faster than for clear-water scour. The scour depth at a certain pier is about ten percent greater in a clear-water situation compared to a live-bed situation (Chase and Holnbeck, 2004). Clear water scour tends to occur at a slower rate than that of the live-bed scour.

2.9.3.2 Long-Term Aggradation and Degradation
Aggradation and degradation are long-term changes to the elevation of a streambed. Aggradation means that sediment is brought into the area from upstream and is being deposited at the downstream. This causes a rise in the bed elevation of the downstream. Degradation refers to situations when the bed materials are being transported away resulting in a decrease in elevation of the stream or riverbed. These changes can be either a natural trend of the river or a result of some man-made modifications of the stream.

29

2.9.3.3 General Scour
General scour is when the streambed lowers due to changes in the water flow caused by flow through a contraction or around a bend. This type of scour can lead to various scour depths at different parts along the cross-section or it can result in to a uniform lowering of the streambed. The difference between general scour and long-term degradation is that the general scour can be a cyclic process. Contraction scour occurs when the available flow area decreases. This happens at a bridge if the piers are placed in the river or the abutments are placed at the bank lines or in the river resulting in a decrease in flow area and causes an increase in flow velocity. The increased velocity causes an increase of erosive forces and the streambed starts to erode. As the bed elevation is lowered the available flow area increases and the flow velocity and scour decrease until equilibrium state is reached.

2.9.3.4 Local Scour
Local scour around bridge piers is the result of the acceleration of the flow and formation of vortices around the piers. As the flow is interrupted a strong pressure field decreasing with the depth is formed in front of the obstruction. If the pressure field is strong enough, it causes a threedimensional separation of the boundary layer. It drives the approaching flow downwards, and a recirculating primary vortex is formed on the upstream side of the pier. As the flow passes through the bridge, the vortices wrap around the sides of the piers in the shape of a horseshoe and continue downstream. This is called a horseshoe vortex The primary vortex system in front of the pier is the main scour force, and it removes bed material from the base of the pier. Since the rate at which material is carried away from the area is greater than the transport rate into it, a scour hole is formed around the pier. As the scour hole gets deeper the strength of the vortices at the base of the pier decrease and eventually a state of equilibrium is reached. For a clear-water situation that happens when the shear stress from the vortices equals the critical stress for the sediment particles, and no more bed material is scoured. For a live-bed situation, equilibrium is reached when the amount of sediment inflow equals the amount of outflow from the scour hole. In that situation, the scour depth fluctuates, while the average depth remains constant.

30

The horseshoe vortices act mainly on the upstream face and the sides of a pier, whereas on the downstream side of the pier another type of vortices dominate, called wake vortices. They are formed along the surface of the pier, then detached from both sides and continue downstream The wake vortices together with the accelerated side flow and the upward flow behind the pier causes the downstream scouring. The pier itself generates the wake vortices, and their size and strength depend mainly on the velocity of the flow and the pier size and shape. The strength of a wake vortex declines rapidly downstream of a pier and therefore there is often a deposit of material downstream of piers (Chase and Holnbeck, 2004).

2.9.4 Extreme weather events
The focus of earlier climate model studies of global warming was mainly on changes in mean climate. It has been only since the early 1990s that climate models have started to be analyzed to study possible changes of future weather and climate extremes (Meehl et al., 2000). There is also clear evidence of changes in extremes of precipitation. For the contiguous United States and Canada. Kunkel et al. (2003) and Groisman et al. (2008) find statistically significant increases in heavy (upper 5%) and very heavy (upper 1%) precipitation by 14% and 20%, respectively. Much of this increase occurred during the last three decades of the century especially over the eastern parts of United States. Groisman et al. (2008) showed that even as the top 0.3% of heavy rains has increased by 27% from 1967 to 2006, so have dry spells increased in most places. Also, there is evidence for Europe and the United States that the relative increase in precipitation extremes is larger than the increase in mean precipitation, and this is manifested as an increasing contribution of heavy events to total precipitation (Alexander et al., 2006). Globallyaveraged over the land area with sufficient data, the percentage contribution to total annual precipitation from very wet days (upper 5%) has increased in the past 50 years even in places where mean precipitation amounts are not increasing (Kunkel et al. (1999). Flooding records are often confounded by changes in land use and increasing human settlement in flood plains. Nevertheless, great floods have been found to be increasing in the twentieth century (Paasche and Storen, 2014).

31

3 Current Research
To investigate the structural impact of climate change on river bridge infrastructure, a bridge on the Ottawa river was used as a case study to demonstrate the utilization of the finite element modelling and analysis to investigate the response of the bridge and how the bridge can be adapted to the structural impacts of climate change.

3.1 Portage Bridge
The Portage bridge is a bridge on the Ottawa River. It crosses the river downstream of the Chaudiere bridge. It is the link between Laurier street and Alexander-Tache boulevard. The bridge was completed and opened in 1973 by the National Capital Commission. The Portage bridge is 160 meters long.

The Ottawa river is a river in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. For most of its length, it defines the border between the two provinces. It is a major tributary of the St. Lawrence River. The river rises at Lake Capimitchigama, in the Laurentian Mountains of central Quebec, and flows west to Lake Timiskaming. From there its route has been used to define the interprovincial border with Ontario. From Lake Timiskaming, the river flows southeast to Ottawa and Gatineau, where it tumbles over the Chaudière Falls and further takes in the Rideau and Gatineau rivers.

The Ottawa River drains into the Lake of Two Mountains and the St. Lawrence River at Montreal. The river is 1,271 kilometers long. it drains an area of 146,300 square kilometers, 65 percent in Quebec and the rest in Ontario, with a mean discharge of 1,950 cubic meters per second. The average annual mean water-flow measured at Carillon dam, near the Lake of Two Mountains, is 1,939 cubic meters per second with average annual extremes of 749 to 5,351 cubic meters per second. Record historic levels since 1964 are a low of 529 cubic meters per second in 2005 and a high of 8,190 cubic meters per second. Figure 3.1 shows a stretch of Ottawa river showing portage bridge.

3.2 Methodology for the present study
Precipitation and flood level historical data for the study area was obtained from the Ottawa River Regulation Planning Board, data included the historical water levels and discharges along the Ottawa river at Lake Timiskaming, Mattawa, Pembroke, Lake Coulonge, Arnprior, Britannia, Hull, Grenville and Carillon. These flood data were used to determine the 1:100- year flood discharge of the basin. A 20% increase in discharge was determined to simulate the likely increase in flood levels due to climate change as projected for the basin. These data were used for hydraulic analysis to derive the channel velocity, inundation depths and scour depths around bridge piers in a flood event. The flood data is included in Appendix 2. Results of the hydraulic analysis, which were Stream Velocity (m/s), Scour depth (m) and flood levels (inundation depths) (m) were then used in a structural model alongside other structural loads to determine the response of bridges along the basin.

3.3 Hydraulic analysis
Digital elevation models (DEM) for the study area which were derived from LIDAR data was obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) for the purposes of this study. The 33

DEMs were processed into Triangulated irregular network maps (TIN) and cross sections, stream center line, river bank and over banks were digitized using ArcGIS software version 10.4.1. The purpose of these is to create a dataset compatible with HEC-RAS which was used for the hydraulic analysis and scour prediction.

Figure 3.2 Digital Elevation map (DEM) of study area showing heights above sea level. (source: USGS)

The HEC-RAS (version 5.0.3) is a software developed by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE, 2016). It uses the backwater calculation procedure as HEC-2 (USACE, 1990) which has been the industry standard in flood water hydraulic modelling but with improved data processing and graphical capabilities. (Ferdous, et al. 2014). A steady-state hydraulic model was then developed in HEC-RAS using the data set and cross sections generated in ArcGIS as imported inputs. In total, twenty-one cross sections and the bridge site was included in the analysis. The final model was run with the estimated flood discharges for a 100-year storm, which is the standard used in bridge designs. Additional runs were conducted for 100-year plus 20% to simulate the projected increase in precipitation due to climate change at the portage bridge site on the Ottawa River. Figure 3.3 and Figure 3.4 show hydraulic analysis output for the basin for a 100-year storm at upstream and downstream cross-section of the bridge respectively while Figure 3.5 and Figure 3.6 show the

34

hydraulic analysis results for 100-year 100 plus 20% increase in discharge due to climate change respectively.

The stream flow velocity at any point in time at any position is calculated by HEC-RAS using the manning's equation: Q=VA=(1/n) AR2/3S Where: Q = Flow Rate, (m3/s) v = Velocity, (m/s) A = Flow Area, (m2) n = Manning's Roughness Coefficient R = Hydraulic Radius, (m) S = Channel Slope, (m/m) (3.1)

3.4 Scour Depth Prediction
Several research studies have been carried out with the aim of predicting scour, and various equations have been developed. Khwairakpam et al. (2012) provided examples of such studies to include Laursen and Toch (1956), Liu et al. (1961), Shen et al. (1969), Breusers et al. (1977), Jain and Fischer (1984), Melville and Sutherland (1988), Froehlich (1989), Melville (1992), Abed and Gasser (1993), Richardson and Richardson (1994), Lim (1997) and Heza et al. (2007). Most of these empirical equations were based on results of laboratory and field data, and they differ from one another based on the factors and parameters considered in constructing the scour model, laboratory or field conditions. Out of these equations, the most commonly used pier scour equations in the is the Colorado State University scour equation (Khwairakpam et al. 2012). The scour depth was calculated using HEC -RAS. HEC RAS scour prediction model is based on the scour equation developed by Colorado State University and recommended by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 18 (HEC-18), Federal Highway Administration (1993), which is expressed as follows: ds = 2.0yK1K2K 3 K 4 b 0.65F 0.43

(3.2)

where ds = scour depth,

37

y = flow depth at upstream of pier K1, K2, K3 K

= correction factors for pier nose shape, angle of attack, bed conditions and

armouring respectively, b = pier width, F = Froude number. It is recommended in the HEC-18 that the limiting value of ds/y is 2.4 for F = 0.8 and 3.0 for F greater than 0.8. The scour equation was developed from laboratory data and was recommended for both live-bed and clear-water conditions (USACE, 1990).

3.5 Finite Element Analysis
A finite element model of a bridge at the site of Portage bridge was developed and calibrated using the finite element analysis software STAAD Pro to simulate the existing bridge circumstances and design. The bridge was analyzed for loads based on the Canadian highway bridge design code. (CHBDC). The model conforms to the initial bridge geometry design to resist a 100-year flood, wind load and other antecedent loads such as dead and live loads. The model was constructed to study the effect of increased scour depth and increased flood load on the existing bridge. The bridge model was idealized as a beam bridge which consists of a 250 mm reinforced concrete deck supported by 8 reinforced concrete girders spanning continuously over eight 20 m spans. The transverse width of the deck is 17 m and carries 4 lanes of highway each 3.5 m wide. On each extreme side is a shoulder of 1.5m wide each. The center to center spacing between girders is 2.143m with deck overhangs of 1.0m on either side. The girders are supported on beams of 800 mm by 1000 mm depths. Each beam is in turn supported on two 800mm diameter piers, and each has a length of 14.78m from the top of the pile cap. These piers are assumed to be fixed at the base. The girders at the two end spans were supported on roller supports to simulate the support found between the girders and abutment interface at end spans. Figure 3.7 shows a 3d model of the bridge while Figure 3.8 and Figure 3.9 shows the transverse and longitudinal sections respectively.

More runs of the models were carried out to study the response when the 100-year flood has increased by 20%. The results were then analyzed to determine their response to the increased flood and wind load. It is desired to check the capacity of these bridges to resist the added loads 38

and hence determine their safety. The STAAD.pro code input of finite element analysis is included in appendices 4 and 5.

3.6 Loading
3.6.1 Dead Loads
Dead loads included the weight of all components of the structure and fixtures attached to the bridge, including wearing surface. Unit material weights as specified in Table 3.4 of Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code and reproduced as Table 3.1 in this report was used in calculating dead loads. The weight of water was considered as a dead load in line with the specifications of the CHBDC. Table 3.1 Unit weights of construction materials (CSA, 2014) Material Bituminous wearing surface Reinforced concrete Steel Fresh water Unit weight, kN/m3 23.5 24 77 9.8

3.6.2 Hydrostatic Pressure
Static water pressure is assumed to act perpendicular to the surface that is retaining the water (The piers). The pressure of water at a specific point is calculated as the product of the height of water above that point and the density of water. Hydrostatic pressure = gh where  = density; g = acceleration due to gravity and h= height of liquid.

3.6.3 Hydrodynamic Pressure
The hydrodynamic pressure, also called the longitudinal effect is the load due to flowing water acting longitudinally on an element and is taken as CDAv2/2, where the longitudinal drag coefficient, CD, is as specified in Table 3.11. of CHBDC and reproduced as

40

Table 3.2 in this report. Other parameters of the hydrodynamic effect are defined as follows:  = density L = length of a pier along the longitudinal axis A = Area obstructing flow V = Velocity of flow.

Two profiles were investigated based on stream flow velocity for a 100-year flood and 100-year flood and 20% increase in discharge and a 100-year flood. The scour depth at each event was used to determine the section where the hydrodynamic pressure acts on. Figure 3.10 shows the idealized hydrodynamic pressure on piers. The two profiles are: Profile 1- 100-year return flood Flow velocity = 3.8 m/s Submerged height = 10.5 m Width of pier = 0.8 m Pressure =

41

Pressure over submerged height = 4.46 KN/m

Figure 3.10 Hydrodynamic pressure on bridge piers

3.6.4 Wind Loads
Wind loads were divided into two components as horizontal drag load and vertical load acting simultaneously as specified by CHBDC.

3.6.5 Horizontal drag load
A horizontal wind load of Fh = qCeCgCh was applied to the bridge structure. Fh is horizontal wind load, q is Reference wind pressure, Ce is exposure coefficient and Cg is the gust effect coefficient. Ce and q are as specified in Tables in the CHBDC, Ce is reproduced here in Table 3.3. Cg = 2.5, Ch = 2.0 and the reference wind pressure for study area (Ottawa) is 460 Pa. Fh = qCeCgCh 42

=0.46 x 1.2 x 2.5 x 2.0 = 2.76KN/m2 Diameter of pier = 0.8m Fh = 2.76 x 0.8 = 2.208 kN/m The horizontal wind acts on the exposed portion of the bridge. Portions submerged in water do not experience the wind. Figure 3.11 shows the idealized wind pressure on the bridge piers.

Figure 3.11 Idealized horizontal wind pressure on piers

3.6.6 Vertical Wind Load
A vertical wind is applied as a uniform distributed load over the whole surface of the bridge deck Fv = qCeCgCv, where Fv is vertical wind load, q is Reference wind pressure, Ce is exposure coefficient and C g is the gust effect coefficient. Ce is as specified in Tables in the CHBDC and reproduced here in Table 3.3 and Cg = 2.5 and Cv = 1.0. An additional wind load of same value as Fv is applied as an equivalent line load at the windward quarter point of the transverse width of the deck in accordance with CHBDC

Fv = qCeCgCv q= 0.46 kN/m2 (Ottawa average wind speed. Source CHBDC) 43

3.6.7 Traffic Loadings
3.6.7.1 Truck Loads
In this study, the bridge deck was loaded with the Canadian CL-W truck. A CL-W truck is the idealized five-axle vehicle as shown in Figure 3.12. Load values, wheel placement, and the lengths have been calibrated for a 625 kN truck, which is the legal limit in Canada. This truck is encompassed in a 3 x 3 m clearance envelope with 1.8 m wheel to wheel spacing as shown in Figure 3.13. The CL-W truck is positioned longitudinally and transversely within a design lane at the location and in the direction, that produces maximum load effect for the design of each bridge element.

3.6.7.2 Lane Loads
The CL-W lane load consists of a CL-W truck load with each axle reduced to 80% of the values given in Figure 6 superimposed with a 9 kN/m lane load applied over an area 3 m wide. As per Code specification. lane loads should not be applied where it reduces the overall load effects, lane loads were not applied in this model. Because girders are continuous over supports, application of the lane load over the entire superstructure would result in lower maximum positive bending moments at mid-spans. 44

3.6.8 Design Lane
This refers to a longitudinal strip that is a fraction of the deck width and within which a truck or lane load is placed for the purpose of design or evaluation. This model consists of 4 design lanes each 3m in width. The code specifies that when multiple lanes are loaded on a highway bridge, a load reduction factor should be applied to account for the probability of all lanes not being loaded at the same time.

3.6.9 Load combinations
Nine ultimate load combinations were investigated as per CHBDC specifications to determine the governing load case for design. Table 3.4 below shows the load combinations.

3.7 Analysis
The bridge model was developed using STAAD Pro finite element analysis and design software and calibrated with all the appropriate loads. A moving load case was defined and used to generate the maximum responses (i.e. the location of the CLW-625 loading or lane loading on this bridge that will generate the maximum responses) on the bridge elements. The maximum response was combined with other live and dead loads described earlier.

4 Results and Discussions
4.1 Hydrological Results and Water Levels for Analyzed 100Year Storm
The water surface levels for the analyzed 5 kilometers stretch of the Ottawa river ranges between 44.54 m and 51.06 m. The water surface level at the cross section of the bridge location was 47.89 m. Critical flow at bridge section occurs at 47.67 m while the total energy line lies at 49.82 m. This water level is in agreement with the historical water level as measured during an occurrence of the 100-year storm event measured at the Hull station in 1976 and given as 44.74 m. Figure 4.1 shows the water level and other hydrologic parameters for the river stretch. The water surface level for the 100-year storm event is labeled PF1. while Figure 4.2 shows the water surface levels at the portage bridge site.

The result of water levels for the 100-year storm corresponds with measured water levels when a 100-year storm occurred in 1974. The correspondence of these results of the analysis with measured historical data gives credibility to the calibration of the model. Chanel flow velocities for the 100-year storm event along the stretch of the river ranges from 1.39 m/s to 4.03 m/s. The velocity just upstream of the bridge is 3.8 m/s while the velocity of flow just downstream of the bridge is 4.03 m/s. The variation in the velocities is due to changes in profile along sections of the river. The discharge at any point along the river reach is related to the velocity of flow and the wetted area by the relationship Q = VA, where A is the wetted area and V is the

48

velocity of flow. The full output table for the hydraulic analysis is shown in Appendix 1. Figure 4.3 shows the variation in velocities along the river reaches.

4.2 Hydrological Results for 100-Year Storm in Projected Changed Climate
For a projected climate with a 20% increase in 100-year storm discharge, the water surface levels for the analyzed 5 kilometer stretch of the Ottawa river ranges between 45.13 m and 51.88 m. This translate to about 1m increase in average water levels. The water surface level at the cross section of the bridge location was 48.34 m. Critical flow at bridge section occurs at 48.19 m while the total energy line lies at 50.63 m. Figure 4.4 shows the water level and other hydrologic parameters for the river stretch. The water surface level for the 100-year storm event in the projected climate is labeled PF3. while Figure 4.5 shows the water surface levels at the portage bridge site. Channel flow velocities for the 100-year storm event along the stretch of the river ranges from 1.47 m/s to 4.29 m/s. The velocity just upstream of the bridge is 3.99 m/s while velocity of flow just downstream of bridge is 4.29 m/s. The full output table for the hydraulic analysis is shown in Appendix 1. Figure 4.6 shows the variations in velocities along the river reaches.

4.3 Design scour for 100-year storm
The scour depths at the base of the bridge piers were computed using the Colorado state university equation (CSU) for live bed scour as recommended in the HEC-18. The piers design scour consisted of a combination of pier scours and contraction scour that is on an elevation of 36.68m as shown in Figure 4.7. The total scour depth computed from the difference between the ground elevation, and the total scour elevation is 6.32 m. A complete description of scour calculations input and output for 100- year storm is included in Appendix 2. The height of the deck was 51.6 m while the water surface stood at 47.18 m. The total depth of water is the difference between the water surface and the sour elevation which was 10.5 m.

4.4 Scour for 100-year storm in projected climate
Again, for the projected climate where the 100-year storm discharge has increased by 20%, the scour depths at the base of the bridge piers was computed using the CSU equation for live bed scour as recommended in the HEC-18. The piers design scour consisted of a combination of pier scours and contraction scour that is on an elevation of 35.82 m in the channel as shown in Figure 4.8. The total scour depth computed from the difference between the ground elevation and the total scour elevation is 7.18 m. A complete description of scour calculations input and output is provided in Appendix 3. Diagram showing scour depths in projected climate is shown in Figure 4.8.

4.5 Results of bridge elements under normal design loading
Highway and river bridges are usually analyzed and designed for a lifespan of 100 years. For the present study, the response of the bridge elements, that is, beams, girders and piers to loading was analyzed. The results of two main piers that were found to be critical are discussed here.

4.5.1 Axial and Shear forces
Figure 4.9 shows the arrangement of the piers on the bridge. The piers are numbered 1 to 14, after analysis, piers 7 and 8 were critical as they were exposed to the largest forces. The maximum axial force on pier 7 was controlled by ultimate load combination 3 (Table 3.4).

Figure 4.9 Plan of bridge piers arrangement

54

The maximum axial load on pier 7 is 4483 kN, these load combinations include the dead load, hydrodynamic load and wind load in addition to the vehicle loads. The maximum shear force is 106 kN at the top of the pier. Figure 4.10 and Figure 4.11 shows the axial force and shear force envelopes diagrams for pier 7.

Figure 4.10 Axial load envelope for pier 7

Figure 4.11 Shear force envelope for pier 7 For pier 8, the maximum axial load and shear force was 4482 kN and 104 kN as shown in Figure 4.12 and Figure 4.13, respectively.

Figure 4.13 Shear force envelope for pier 8

4.5.2 Bending Moments and Design Requirements
Lateral forces and load eccentricity induced bending moments in the pier. The maximum bending moment in pier 7 is 1021 kNm. Figure 4.14 shows the bending moment envelope for pier 7.

Figure 4.14 Bending moment envelope for pier 7.

For pier 8, the maximum bending moment in the pier is 1018KNm as shown in the bending moment envelope in Figure 4.15.

4.6 Response of Bridge to Loading and Effects of Scouring In Projected Climate
The same bridge was analyzed for conditions in the projected climate. The vehicle loads, wind loads and self-weight of the structure were kept constant, while the scour depth and hydrodynamic pressure were varied accordingly. The response of the bridge elements was then determined using the new conditions.

4.6.1 Axial and shear forces
The maximum axial forces on pier 7 and 8 remained constant because there was no increment in factors contributing to the axial forces. The maximum shear forces, however, had increased. This is due to the increase in scour depths and the hydrodynamic pressure on the piers. The maximum shear force on pier 7 for the controlling load combination had increased from 106 kN to 149 kN for the projected climate as shown below in Figure 4.16. While for pier 8, the maximum shear force increased to 107 kN as shown in Figure 4.17.

Figure 4.17 Shear force envelope for pier 8 in projected climate

4.6.2 Bending moments and design requirements
The maximum bending moments on the bridge elements for the critical piers has increased. The maximum bending moment in pier 7 increased from 1021 kNm to 1042 kNm while the maximum bending moment for pier 8 increased from 1018 kNm to 1032 kNm. These increments in the maximum bending moment were due to the increase in scour depths, water flow velocity and the depth of flow. Figure 4.18 and Figure 4.19 show the bending moment envelopes for both piers.

4.7 Effects of Age and Exposure Conditions and Climate Change Interactions on Concrete Infrastructures
Bridge infrastructures and other infrastructure built with concrete and steel ages, they deteriorate due to effects of environmental loading that they are exposed to. These deteriorations result in spalling (loss of concrete), which ultimately reduces the sectional dimensions of the member and also the loss of reinforcement. These losses combine to reduce the strength of the members. In a changing climate where the rate of deterioration is exacerbated, the effects of age and exposure conditions on existing infrastructures such as a bridge is somewhat difficult to predict since different exposure conditions will have different effects and are difficult to be simulated accurately. Experimental analysis by several researchers has in the past tried to predict residual strength based on accelerated corrosion of reinforced, prestressed and fiber reinforced concrete elements. Other methods used to estimate the residual strength of reinforced concrete has been done by testing structural elements from de-commissioned structures or by coring and testing of samples. Dasar et al. (2017) tested performance reduction of 40-year-old reinforced concrete beams in natural corrosion environments and reported that for every 1% of local cross-sectional loss in the tensile steel bars, a 0.9% reduction in the load-carrying capacity of the reinforced concrete beams occurs. Rodriguez et al. (as cited in Dasar et al. 2017) had reported that a corrosion degree of about 14% caused beam strength to decrease by 23%. The present study did not investigate the effect of climate change on the age and exposure conditions of the bridge, but it is worthy to note that the effects of climate change will compound the strength loss due to age and exposure conditions. 67

5 Conclusion and recommendations
A study was carried out to investigate the impact of climate change on bridge infrastructure and to investigate adaptation measures to protect the bridges against these impacts. A bridge on the Ottawa river was used as case study. The model was constructed to study the effect of increased scour depth and increased flood load on the existing bridge. The bridge model was idealized as a beam bridge which consists of a 250 mm reinforced concrete deck on 7 reinforced concrete girders spanning continuously over eight 20 m spans. The transverse width of the deck is 17 m and carries 4 lanes of highway each 3.5 m wide. On each extreme side is a shoulder of 1.5 m wide each. The center to center spacing between girders is 2.143 m with deck overhangs of 1.0 m on either side. The girders are supported on beams of 800 mm by 1000 mm depths. Each beam is in turn supported on two 800mm diameter piers, and each has a length of 14.78 m from the top of the pile cap The model was analyzed for traffic, wind, hydrostatic and other ancillary loads. Results of analysis for a 100-year storm were compared with results of the analysis for a 100-year storm in a projected climate. Results show that in a projected climate, increased scour depths and hydrodynamic load effects on the bridge piers caused an increase in the shear forces and bending moment and will jeopardize the safety of the bridge. Adaptation measures will have to be carried out to retrofit the bridge to make it safe for use.

5.1 Adapting To Climate Change
River bridge infrastructures can be adapted to the effects of climate change by using the traditional methods of bridge retrofitting or rehabilitation as a result of strength and material deterioration. This is so because even though climate change is a separate phenomenon on its own, its mechanism of effects on infrastructure is by speeding up the rate of deterioration and by increasing physical loads that a structure has to resist.

5.1.1 Jacketing
Jacketing is the process whereby a section of an existing structural member is restored to original dimensions or increased in size by encasement using suitable materials. A steel reinforcement cage

68

or composite material wrap can be constructed around the damaged section onto which shotcrete or cast-in- place concrete is placed. For jacketing, the void between the form and the existing member is filled using pumping, or preplaced aggregate concrete. Jacketing is particularly used for the repair of deteriorated columns, piers, and piles and may easily be employed in underwater applications. It is suggested that the bridge piers should be jacketed to increase the shear and moment capacities to meet with the capacity required for the projected climate. Figure 5.1shows a typical cross section of a jacketed pier.

5.1.2 Scour Protection
From the present study, it is evident that the single most important effect of climate change on river bridge infrastructure that jeopardizes the safety of bridge and users is scouring as a result of a flood. A way to protect and adapt this bridge is by protection against scour. Many scour protection methods have been studied and deployed in bridges susceptible to scouring. The following scour protection method is suggested to be investigated and if found appropriate be deployed to protect against scour of the bridge

5.1.2.1 Riprap
Riprap is one of the most commonly used bridge pier scour protection measures. it consists of large stones placed around a pier to armor the bed. This armoring prevents the strong vortex flow at the front of the pier from entraining bed sediment and forming a scour hole. The ability of the 69

riprap layer to provide scour protection is a function of stone size. Stones are sized such that the current of flowing water is not adequate to displace the ripraps. Design and sizing of riprap stones is described in HEC-23 (Lagasse et al. 2006). Sizing of riprap stones can be determined using the Isbash formula for sizing riprap on a channel bed (Lagasse et al. 2006). d50 =
0.692()2 ( -1)2

(4.4)

d50 = Riprap size (m) V = Design velocity (m/s) k = Coefficient for pier shape Ss = Specific gravity of the riprap g = Acceleration of gravity (9.81 m/s2) In ripraps, filters are used in combinations with the stones, and filters should be a combination of geotextile and granular materials. The selection of geotextile can be based on methods outlined by Koerna (1998), HEC-11 or AASHTO M-288 (Lagasse et al., 2006). Lagasse et al. (2006) advocated the use of Koerna method as it places more emphasis on permeability and less emphasis on particle retension. Geotextile application should exhibit a permeability that is more than 4 times greater than the bed material, that is K g/Ks >4.0 (Lagasse et al., 2006). Kg and Ks are permeability of geotextile and bed materials respectively. For the granullar filters, the requirement is the compatibility of the filter with the sand bed material in terms of both particle retention and permeability. By defining upper and lower limits of d 15 for the filter, the largest size allowable to maintain particle retention and smallest size allowable to ensure the filter has greater permeability than the sand is established. The requirements for the filter to soil relationship are as follows:
15  85 

<5

(4.5)

< 40

The d85 of the filter must be large enough so that the filter does not pass through the riprap. The requirements for filter to riprap relationship are

5.2 Future Study
1 This research studied impact of a changing climate on a river bridge infrastructure. On the particular bridge studied as case study, the scour depth was such that the bridge foundations have not been impacted. There would be bridges and scour depths that may be deep enough to affect foundations. Research should in future be carried out for such cases. 2 Material deterioration caused by climate change need to be studied. Infrastructures may be more impacted by chemical reactions as a result of increased environmental loads rather than physical loads. 3 Apart from new built infrastructure and normally existing infrastructure, some infrastructure has experienced extreme event prior in their service life. This type of infrastructure will likely behave differently in a changing climate. Research should be conducted to study climate change interaction with such infrastructures. 4 In some zones of the world, climate change causes a reduction in environmental loads and factors. Some zones will experience reduced temperature, precipitation and even desertification in extremes. A study of how civil infrastructures will be impacted in such zones need be studied.
