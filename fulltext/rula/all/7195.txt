UNFOLDING MARGARET MACLEAN'S ORIHON-FORMAT SCRAPBOOK IN THE ROYAL ONTARIO MUSEUM COLLECTION: A FOCUS ON CONTEXT, PRESERVATION AND ACCESS Master of Arts 2017 Celio Humberto Barreto Ramos B.A., B.F.A. (Hons.) Photographic Preservation and Collections Management Ryerson University

Abstract
My thesis comprises the analysis, cataloguing and preservation of Canadian author and educator Margaret MacLean's Japan Scrapbook at The Royal Ontario Museum. This project uses collections management strategies to describe the scrapbook at the item-level, catalog 597 printed photographs and images for upload to The Museum System database (TMS); attempts to decode the author's compilation and editorial process and finally, make recommendations for suitable handling procedures for access and physical preservation. The objects are affixed onto a large-format, traditional, Japanese, accordion-bound, album-style book called orihon. Together they capture a moment in Japanese history and visual culture in the first decade of the 20th century, and foreshadow MacLean's 1920s education work at The ROM. The scrapbook was compiled sometime between 1904 and 1928, using materials ranging from about 1880 to 1915, illustrating the 1904 to 1908 period when Margaret Maclean and her father resided in Yokohama, Japan.

Introduction
In-betweenness would be a perfect way to describe the state of Margaret MacLean's Japanese Scrapbook, the object itself, its author, and its trajectory through the museum since 1928. Some may find this object rich with images of a distant land from a long time ago, where cultures, traditions and conflict intertwine with each other in a complex, multi-layered context. This object manifests the intersection of the cultural, familial, professional, religious, political, and social currents in Margaret MacLean's life. It functions as both a chronicle of her life in Japan and as a historical record of events relevant to the people living in Yokohama at the time. Some of these events have been forgotten in the wake of nearly 115 years of natural disasters, wars and reconstruction. Others have been deliberately left out of her record. This object has resided in The ROM collection since 1928, without description or documentation. It was compiled between 1904 and 1928 with materials dating from about 1880 to 1915, and it focuses on MacLean's experience of life in Japan between 1904 and 1908. Using collections management strategies, this project sets out to describe the scrapbook at the item level and catalog 597 photographs and images for upload to the The Museum System database (TMS). It also attempts to decode the author's compilation and editorial process and makes recommendations for its handling and long-term physical preservation.

The object itself, a type of orihon, (a Japanese term where ori means fold and hon means book) has a structure considered as an intermediary step between a scroll and a codex first developed in 9th century China. In the MacLean scrapbook's case, it is a great vehicle where this ancient Asian book form and Western scrapbook traditions fuse together. As an East Asian book with Japanese subject matter, it is in the care of the Bishop White Committee Library of East Asia. It is also a document related to the the museum's history, therefore it is also

1

associated with the museum archives. Its contents; photographs, e-hagaki, ukiyo-e and other visual media, make it appropriate to be part of the Museum's Far Eastern collection. This is a recent development made possible as a result of my work and shifting values in museum collections that have embraced photography, popular culture and ephemera as art objects. These multiple stewardship jurisdictions intersect with multiple access points for different audiences. This condition further reinforces the scrapbook's state of `betweenness' in its institutional context.

Margaret MacLean's biography helps the reader contextualize this object in both time and space. It is a reflection of this singular woman's mind, keen observation skills, meticulous attention to detail and an impressive depth of knowledge. At times she is obvert and spells out her impressions, and at others she is much more succinct, letting her compilations carry her message. The richness of this book depends just as much into what she includes as in what she leaves out. Margaret MacLean was a true educator, genuinely concerned with telling a whole story and at the same time leaving space for discovery, making the journey through her scrapbook both enjoyable and rewarding.

Finally, if we think of family photographs as those images which occupy a special place in the domestic space, beholden to a meaning by the owner, then this scrapbook is also a family album from a time when such an object was not yet formalized1. It is a photo album of massproduced pictures used to weave a very personal narrative of MacLean's life in Japan. Her compilation methodology and hand-written captions sets it apart as a unique object, which she held in high esteem until the end of her life.

Literature Survey

This literature survey focuses on sources that expand my understanding of the history and cultural significance of scrapbooks in late Victorian and Edwardian periods, increase my connoisseurship of Yokohama's photographs, photographers and publishers, as well as the cultural, social and political context of early 20th Century Japan; to inform precise item-level cataloguing and the physical preservation of this object and its contents. This survey is therefore divided into three major sections: 1) Histories of Scrapbooks, to understand the role of scrapbooks in North American culture and their interpretation; 2) The History of Yokohama Photography to 1912, to understand the development of commercial, public and private photographic production during the Meiji Period (1868-1912), including press images of the Russo-Japanese War. Finally, 3) a Collections Management for Scrapbooks, photographs and prints section to help me determine the cataloging methodology and controlled vocabularies to use in the apparent absence of established scrapbook cataloging approaches. This section will also inform my initial assessment of preservation strategies to mitigate the impact of repeated handling on this object and its elements.

Histories of scrapbooks and albums: In Scrapbooks: An American History, author Jessica Helfand gives a cursory introduction to the history of scrapbooks, tracing their origin to Renaissance period books that were enriched with commentaries and other bits and pieces that showed the owners intellectual engagement with the book's contents that were called "commonplace book". She then notes that in the late 18th century an English clergyman by the name of James Granger introduced a new kind of book that expanded on this notion, which "...reconsidered scholarship in the context of more

3

varied materials". 2 Extra-illustrated books of this type are also known as "grangerized" books, and were "rebound to include additional engravings, watercolors, manuscripts, documents, and playbills as well as other miscellaneous items". 3 She then talks about the changes taking place in the early 1900s and the cultural shift away from then rigidity and symmetry of Victorian mores expressed in 19th century scrapbooks to the more expressive and experimental aesthetics shaping the new 20th century scrapbooks. This introduction and history however is very brief and does not delve deep.

The Scrapbook in American Life, is a collection of essays edited by Katherine Ott, curator in the Division of Science and Medicine at the Smithsonian Institution, Susan Tucker, curator of books and records at Tulane University's Newcomb College Centre for Research on Women and Patricia P. Buckler, associate professor of English and director of composition at Purdue University North Centreline Westville. These essays explore scrapbooks as both manuscripts of learning and knowing and books of the self. In the essay "An Introduction to The History of Scrapbooks", the editors and contributors explore a number of themes they associate with the book form: Selves in Books, The Genealogy of Memory Keeping, Color Printing and Other New Technologies, An Educational and Moral Tool, The Culture of Capitalism, The Photography Revolution, Private and Unique, Rupture and Reassemblage, Collage: The Scrapbook's Art Form, Ephemeral Ephemera and The Stigma of Mass Culture. This book is more theoretical in scope, with fewer illustrations of the scrapbooks than I expected. Professor Patricia P. Buckler's contribution in this book, the essay titled "Letters, Scrapbooks, and History Books: A Personalized Version of the Mexican War, 1846-48" looks at

2

the personal correspondence of the authors of a scrapbook at the time of the Mexican War. She examines how these letters help contextualize the various war mementos and ephemera compiled in the Buckler scrapbook. She compares scrapbooks to letters stating that scrapbooks are usually compiled closer to the events depicted than are memoirs; which are generally assembled later and incorporate reflections that are more distanced from events than letters. Buckler conceives of the scrapbook as intertext "the scrapbook ... is literally composed of texts and quotations, intermingled to express metatextual meanings."4 However, Buckler warns that "...the interplay among these texts can be at best speculative."5 The author shows that scrapbooks are not spontaneous documents created immediately following an event, but rather incorporate reflections on the author's part. Buckler summarizes that scrapbooks are cultural products usually authored by women over longer periods of time, with the goal of passing them on to the next generation.

Art History Professor Jennifer A. Jolly's chapter "History in the Making" examines the multiple layers of recording history through Gertrude Raddin's scrapbook of the Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago. In this case study, Jolly argues that Raddin's scrapbook allows access to three levels of history, with the first level populated by the events, people and objects at the Chicago fair and their impact. The second layer is made up of the cultural significance of the scrapbook itself and the third layer is comprised of the writing and recording of history. She further states that her scrapbook reveals some aspects of familial interactions, her involvement with her church, the mass media and popular opinions around her as well as her thirty-five years of life experience.

I could see strong parallels between the Raddin and MacLean scrapbooks right away, at least insofar as the analysis was concerned. Their visual styles and compilation aesthetics and subject matter are mostly unrelated, yet they share so much in common as records of history. What I learnt most explicitly from her essay is that scrapbooks are at the intersection of the personal and the public. I intend to inform my analysis of the Margaret MacLean album with Jolly's analytical framework to reveal what I can of this intersection in her work.

Art Institute of Chicago's Associate Curator of Photography Elizabeth Siegel in her book Galleries of Friendship and Fame: A History of Nineteenth-Century American Photograph Albums examines the shifts in taste American families experienced that brought the obsolescence of carte-de-visite and cabinet card albums in the chapter "The Demise of the Card Album, The Rise of the Snapshot Album." The author shows that the transition of familygathering spaces from the formal parlour to the more casual living room, relegated sentimental objects to private spaces as early as the 1880s. After the emergence of snapshot photography in 1888, portrait photographs no longer represented the person as a whole, and friends and family members displaced the professional photographer and the photo studio from dominance. Snapshot print formats and sizes increased, and the scrapbook was uniquely positioned to gather them both for safekeeping and for display. The scrapbook format reflected the more casual and free way in which snapshots were being made, allowing for new kinds of layouts to take shape. The album had become highly personal, and reflected more on the life of an individual instead of a whole family. Quoting author Marilyn F. Motz, Siegel states: "such albums presented women's constructions of their lives as they saw them and as they wished to have them seen by others".6

While MacLean's scrapbook begins with a more general coverage of current events taking place during her time in Yokohama, such as The Russo-Japanese War, the narrative becomes more personal as it progresses, ending with a page dedicated to her father in the last leaf. There are some events which she decided not to cover in her scrapbook, such as the Hibiya Riots of September of 1905, the true purpose of Minister of Labour Rodolphe Lemieux's visit to Japan or more personally, the death of her father in 1908. These omissions reinforce the notion that MacLean presents a construction of this aspect of her life in Japan as she wished to be seen by others.

History of Yokohama photography up to 1912: In the article "Sites of "Disconnectedness": The Port City of Yokohama, Souvenir Photography, and its Audience", Mio Wakita, Professor of Asian art history at UniversitÃ¤t Heidelberg, provides a historical context to the international nature of Yokohama. The author also explores the assumptions of "otherness" that both foreign tourists and other Japanese nationals had about Yokohama and its inhabitants. Wakita examines the impact of globetrotter tourism on the transformation of Yokohama photography after the 1860s, driving up the export of hand-tinted, albumen-print albums. The author demonstrates that Yokohama was a cosmopolitan centre and the entry point of technologies and foreign ideas into Japan, that was neither a fully western nor fully Japanese city, giving rise to the manufacture of cultural imagebased products that presented a romanticized ideal view of Japan for the tourist market.

In the exhibition book Art and Artifice: Japanese Photographs of the Meiji Era: Selections from the Jean S. and Frederic A. Sharf Collection at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, edited by independent scholar Sebastian Dobson, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Senior Curator of Japanese Art Anne Nishimura Morse and collector Frederic A. Sharf, the authors explore the

7

context in which Souvenir albums arose in popularity in Japan. In his entry "A Traveller's Paradise", Sharf talks about key 19th century developments in politics, transportation and technology that influenced the tourist industry in Japan, and the emergence of visual products designed explicitly for tourist consumption. The authors show that an inverse relationship existed between imaging technology and subject matter, where the traditional media of woodblock prints was used to depict the revolutionary modernization of Japan, and the world's most advanced imaging technology was used to portray a romanticized vision of a traditional Japan unspoiled by modernity. In his essay "Yokohama Shashin" scholar Sebastian Dobson describes a pair of 1872 Japanese photo albums by photographer Uchida Kuichi as "Lavishly bound in two traditional orihon or 'accordion' albums, each decorated with brocade covers and end papers flecked with silver gilt, the photographs are accompanied by handwritten paper labels in Japanese pasted in each mount" (page 20). The MacLean scrapbook corresponds to this general description of the orihon structure, however it appears to lack silver-gilt flecked end papers. The contents pasted in the MacLean scrapbook do not correspond to the above description, suggesting that she may have been working on a blank orihon album or an altered one.

The books Photography in Japan 1853-1912, and Old Japanese Photographs: Collectors' Data Guide by author, researcher and collector Terry Bennett provide a history and a detailed registry of commercial photographers in the Meiji period. Bennett approaches history from a connoisseurship angle, based on his extensive research to chronicle the development of photography in Japan, from 1853 to 1912. He introduces both western and Japanese photographers to the English-language historical record. Bennett's proficient knowledge is indispensable in understanding the booming photographic industry in Meiji Japan. He states that

8

conclusive attribution of commercially produced tourist photographs is still elusive, as photographs stock changed hands when studios went out of business as well as the destruction of records in natural disasters and World War Two bombardments. Bennett also provides a copy of the Japanese Photographic Copyright Regulations established in 1887, and a detailed photography timeline of people and events.

The MacLean album's photographic and photomechanically reproduced images largely draw from the tourist photograph. The albumen prints date largely from the 1880s, likely purchased from leftover stock at the various souvenir photography shops spread throughout the city. Many of the picture postcards are reproductions of these older images as well. A number of both of these prints are smaller, cheaper versions of photographs by well-known photographers or photo studios found in more expensive albums, and photography books, and demonstrate the flexibility in distribution for these types of images in the Japanese market in the first decade of the 20th century.

Collections Management for scrapbooks, photographs and prints. Scrapbooks do not fit neatly into established cataloguing guidelines due to their complexity and variety of component elements. It is therefore necessary to establish a number of fields to be used in the database as well as choosing a controlled vocabulary authority that will help in the creation of accurate, sharp, concise and precise descriptions that researchers will find useful in the future.

Director for Collections & Services and Chief of the Prints and Photographs Division of the Library of Congress, Helena Zinkham gives a detailed coverage of photograph description and cataloguing methodologies for cultural institutions in her chapter "Description and Cataloging" in

9

Photographs: Archival Care and Management, edited by National Archives' Document Conservation Laboratory chief, Mary Lynn Ritzenthaler. Zinkham highlights the special benefits of description for photographs, makes recommendations on descriptive elements, outlines the optional levels and depths of cataloging and finally offers an overview of guidelines and standards as well as resource needs and risk prevention. Her pragmatic advice is a concise resource to help me describe and catalog the scrapbook images following consensus-based best practices without having to start this process from zero.

University of Idaho Library Conservator Melissa Tedone's online webinar and handout titled "Preserving Historic Scrapbooks and Making New Ones That Last" outlines a variety of strategies she uses to preserve over 1,400 scrapbooks in the university's collection. Tedone uses and defines the term `inherent vice' as the tendency towards deterioration innate to each component of the scrapbook, and of the scrapbook as a whole. She also covers various suitable approaches to a particular preservation issue but warns that there are no "silver bullet" solutions. She overviews interleaving, isolation/encapsulation, preservation surrogates/ digitization, stabilization/conservation treatments, rehousing, disbanding and disassembly and expanding on each of these solutions to mitigate a scrapbook's inherent vice.

Photographer and bookbinding enthusiast Graeme Dawes's article on Japanese orihon book binding comments that the origins of this book style originates in 8th Century China. She provides some historical context, describing how orihon were used in ancient Japan to both show and preserve paintings and calligraphy. Dawes explains that orihon are intended to stand on their side, displaying their contents vertically, rather than horizontally on a flat surface. Dawe's provides an in-depth description of orihon structure, composition, sizes and handling guidelines. Dawes describes this type of book binding and how it was designed to be used. I

10

have learnt about its structure and binding materials, giving me valuable information for cataloguing and new factors to consider for effective preservation.

Emeritus Professor of Japanese Studies at Cambridge University Peter Kornicki's The Book in Japan: A Cultural History from the Beginnings to the Nineteenth Century is an in-depth study into the history of Japanese books dating to the 7th Century. His chapter on ancient conservation and preservation practices in Japan and China. The author describes how the ancients there used light, air flow and camphor wood interleaving to deter and arrest the growth of mould and insect infestation in Japan's hot and humid climate, and how these practices survived well into the 19th Century.

Conclusion The cultural, historical, social and political contexts in which a particular scrapbook is created in must be well understood to glimpse into the author's mind. Written documents such as letters, diaries and other ephemera can offer additional context to the contents compiled into a scrapbook. Scrapbooks can be difficult to interpret, as they may be compiled over long timeframes, and involve two or more authors. Ways in which to interpret the narrative, identify their compilation process and sources remain to be learned in greater detail.

Globetrotter tourism created a high demand for idyllic images of Japan booming in the 1880s and 1890s. Subsequently, a decrease on foreign visitors' travel restrictions to the interior in 1899, and the increase in snapshot photography since 1888 contributed to the demise of the souvenir album's export market by the early 1900s. When it comes to extant volume of photographs produced in Yokohama at the close of the 19th Century, the attribution of many of these remains elusive due to gaps left by absent business documents and destruction in natural

11

disasters and war, as well as insufficient documentation when other studio stocks were purchased and republished by new owners. A great deal of photograph attribution research remains to be done to identify the origin and trajectory of these photographic images.

Scrapbooks and their contents require concise and precise catalog descriptions at both the collection and item levels to be useful to researchers. The use of descriptive language agreed-upon by consensus, facilitates the usability and accessibility of the records, and allow the cataloger to avoid re-inventing the registration wheel. Conservation and preservation treatments must take into account the multiple deterioration factors that affect the diversity of ephemera that makes up a scrapbook. Suitable solutions to improve accessibility and mitigate their physical deterioration must be balanced against the needs and available resources at the collecting institution. Every conservation and preservation solution is unique to each scrapbook, and there don't seem to be any established cataloguing approaches for these types of objects.

Margaret Sarah MacLean

Very little is known about Margaret MacLean's life before 1904, and it has not been easy to grasp an understanding of this period of her life. Thus further research was required into her father's professional trajectory prior to his appointments to Yokohama and Shanghai to shine light on Margaret's early years (fig. 2). Margaret was born to Alexander MacLean and Sara Smith on December 13th of 1871.7 She was their only daughter, and the middle child out of seven kids.8 Her father was a successful businessman, of Scottih descent.9 Soon after Margaret was born the family moved to Ottawa. There Mr. MacLean bought and ran the Ottawa Times for nearly 10 years before establishing The Canadian Granite Company in the 1880s10. He built a large Gothic Revival home on a generous plot of land on Bank Street Road, just south of Ottawa proper in Nepean11. Margaret was around 10 years old at this time, but had had very little formal schooling. By her own account, she received only 5 years of elementary education, learning her ABCs at the age of ten.12 A hand-written comment by MacLean on a Japanese society lady's wedding photograph reproduced on a Canadian magazine suggest that Margaret attended a very good school nonetheless (Fig. 3).13

In 1891 at the age of 19, she was living at home with her youngest brothers who were half her age. It is possible that a domestic role may have been expected of her as the only daughter, despite the fact that the family had two live-in maids.14 Accounts remark that Margaret was a voracious reader,15 no doubt influenced by her father and her older brother who were journalists. 16 While she may not have had a formal education, she educated herself.

A memorial plaque in the ROM's Canadiana collection commemorates Margaret MacLean's visit to the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.17 She may have gone there with members of her family. It was at this World Expo that the electric railway was introduced to NorthAmerican audiences. In the late 1890s Alexander MacLean would play a major role in installing the finest electric railway transportation system in Canada in the city of Ottawa.18

Her mother, Sarah MacLean (neÃ© Smith), died in 1897,19 when Margaret was about 26 years old. It appears that Margaret took on the role of looking after the household and her aging father's ill health. Margaret was given the Bank Street house in 1899.20 She was an active participant in her community, recognized by The Ladies Aid Societies at Stewarton Church and

The Women's Missionary Society in Nepean, Ottawa.21 They honoured her with a valuable token of their appreciation for her work with young missionaries before departing for Japan in 1904. This event is published in an area newspaper, datable to May of 1904, making it one of the oldest 20th Century items in the Japanese Scrapbook (Fig.4).

As for Mr. Alexander MacLean, he had become quite a popular politician, being elected four times to the office of alderman between 1889 and 190222 . As mentioned earlier, he was instrumental in the Electric Railway system of Ottawa, and had for many years been a government contractor before that23. He was a well known figure in the capital as a journalist, entrepreneur and staunch liberal24 .

In 1903 Canadian interest in trade with Japan began to grow. Canada had a very successful participation in the First National Industrial Exhibition in Osaka, where its agricultural, food and technology products were received quite well. Agriculture Minister Mr. Sydney Fisher, reported right away to Ottawa the great success Canadian bread (wheat) had had at the fair25 . Upon his return, he made a case for the great trade potential with Japan to senior government officials in Wilfried Laurier's Cabinet: "The use of bread is becoming more common every year among the Japanese and this demonstration [at Osaka] of the superiority and relative economy of Canadian hard wheat flour has laid the foundation of what will, in a few years,

become an enormous trade, not only with Japan, but throughout the far east generally." 26

Fisher reported to the newly appointed Governor General of Canada, the Earl Grey on the great demand for Canadian wheat in Japan. This fuelled hopes and dreams for economic growth. Such high demand for Canadian wheat from 45,000,000 Japanese people would prove to be a most bountiful and profitable venture. It would finally justify the expensive and currently unsustainable transcontinental railway two-fold: first, it would be the logistical link to move wheat to the western ports for export to Asia, and two, it would be the transportation system that would bring new European immigrants to settle the vast prairies where they would grow the coveted wheat for Asia. Expectations were highly optimistic and quickly grew like wild fire once the Special Japanese Envoy to Canada, Nosse Tatsugoro reinforced these views with his own. He stated that Japanese people were leaving behind their traditional diet of rice and choosing to eat bread more often. At the time, Japan's impressive rate of westernization and modernization made claims like these entirely plausible. It was decided that same year that the fastest way to get these new trade links established was to forgo government to government treaties27, and send Trade Agents to foster direct trade on behalf of Canadian businesses.

Japan had been forcibly opened up to international trade by U.S. Commodore Perry in 1854. Unequal treaties with the United States were followed by other unequal treaties with European powers, among them the United Kingdom, France, Russia, Germany and others. Japan already had a tightly controlled and regulated trading post with the Dutch at Deshima

Fisher initially reasoned that joining the Anglo-Japanese Alliance Treaty would benefit Canada with minimum tariffs for its products entering Japan. After careful study on his way back to Ottawa, he realized that wasn't the case, and argued for the forgoing of joining that treaty in favour of sending Commercial Agents to lobby for Canadian companies directly.

Island in Nagasaki Bay since the early 1600s. Japan was well aware of the disastrous consequences unequal treaties and European imperialistic ambitions had wrecked on China and other Asian neighbours. By the early 1890s Japan had modernized dramatically and renegotiated most of the unequal treaties as it sought equal standing on the geopolitical stage. In 1894 and 1895 it fought a war with China, defeating that country's armed forces and making territorial gains on the mainland and Taiwan. In 1894 Japan and the United Kingdom signed the comprehensive Alliance Treaty. Its first article provided for the right of subjects from either nation to travel to, do business in, migrate and establish themselves freely in any of either empire's home islands and territories. Canada flatly refused to be a signatory party, effectively excluding itself from the Alliance treaty 28. It can be said that Japanese migrants were neither welcome nor wanted in Canada at the time.

In spite of these discriminatory conditions, Japanese and Canadians engaged in commercial activities privately and directly. Many Japanese companies established trading networks with Canadian counterparts on their own initiative and vice versa. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company had won a contract to deliver mail from the United Kingdom to Hong Kong in the 1880s. This prompted it to build a new fleet of fast steamships to sail between Vancouver and Hong Kong via Yokohama and Shanghai. This line would eventually grow to include other ports of call in Japan, China and The Philippines. In 1891 the first of the new luxurious mail ships, The Empress of Japan entered service. Her sister ships, The Empress of India and The Empress of China, followed suit in the next three years. These ships crossed the pacific in an impressive ten days, and made it possible for a traveler in London to reach Hong Kong in about 22 days traveling exclusively on the Canadian Pacific Railway Company's rail and ship transportation network (fig.5)

On February 8th, 1904, two days after diplomatic relations between Japan and Russia were broken off, the Russo-Japanese War broke out after a surprise Japanese attack at Port Arthur.29 The Canadian government felt even stronger about pushing for trade with Japan, as it would need to feed its people and its army during this new conflict. Alexander MacLean believed that war time embargoes would not affect Canadian trade with Japan, as the war was not taking place on Japanese soil.30 MacLean and many others in Canada believed that as Japan modernized, appetite for western foods and agricultural products would increase31. With this mindset in place the MacLeans left for Yokohama.

Alexander and Margaret MacLean likely arrived in Yokohama on May 16th, 1904 aboard CPR's luxurious RMS Empress of India.32 Their first place of residence based on inbound correspondence dated August 17th, 1904;33 was The Bluff Hotel at No. 2 Bluff, on the hills overlooking the older foreigner's district known as The Settlement. Alexander MacLean's offices were located at No. 14 Bund street, on the same premises of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the Chamber of Commerce (see Appendix D). It was just two doors down from where Felice Beato's studio was located in the 1860s and 1870s. Baron Raimund Von Stillfried

would take over the studio in the 1870s and 1880s. From the1880s to the 1890s Adolfo Farsari set up his studio at the same address next to the Grand Hotel: No. 16 Bund (fig. 6). 34

Their next place of residence was No. 15 Bluff, further away from The Settlement (fig. 7).35 They lived here for most of their stay in Yokohama, likely commuting to work by the electric railway inaugurated that same year. Shortly before being reassigned to Shanghai, the MacLeans lived at No. 58 Bluff, overlooking Motomachi-Dori, on the west bank of the canal separating The Bluff from the city36. All of their homes were in the affluent neighbourhoods of The Bluff, the home of well-to-do foreign and Japanese residents37 .

Margaret MacLean joined the Japanese Red Cross' Foreign Ladies Volunteer Nurses Association in the late spring (fig.8).38 Following the example of the Imperial Princes Komatsu, volunteer nurses around the country were rolling bandages for Japanese casualties of war. The Yokohama chapter was no exception, and its members dutifully engaged in this activity at the British Hospital, which had provided them with a room for this purpose. 39 It appears that most foreign volunteer nurses staid in their local chapters, and very few of them actually treated

casualties of war in the field or at Japanese hospitals.40 Margaret MacLean served in the Yokohama chapter from 1904 to 1905.

It is also at this time that the MacLeans begin to receive invitations to high-society functions and parties. In her scrapbook, Margaret sometimes makes notes on important figures she met, Such as The Marquis Ito, Privy Council of The Empire, with comments such as "dressed like this when I met him".41 1905 appears to be one of the busiest years in the MacLeans' social calendar. The scrapbook contains a number of printed invitations to a number of high-profile Imperial Family parties, receptions for visiting dignitaries and much more. It also contains two articles published in The Globe by Margaret MacLean in June and July of 1905 describing some of these social engagements.

In 1905, Margaret MacLean set off on a four-week visit to China, with the express purpose of experiencing the China not known to non-missionary foreigners. 42 This is a clear statement of her sociological interests. MacLean explored the cities of Shanghai and Soochow, and describes in vivid detail her experiences and observations there.43 Upon her return she focused on writing, and her accounts were published in 1906 as Chinese Ladies at Home. 44 She

was engaged in some business deals far way in Ottawa,45 continued to assist her father, attend official functions and gather photographs and photo postcards in her travels around Japan.

There is one particular dinner they attended at the behest of industrialist Shibuzawa Eichi (fig. 9) in November 27th of 1907, being held in honour of Canadian Minister of Labour, Rudolph Lemieux, who was visiting Japan to force that government to curtail Japanese migration to Canada and preserve Canada's friendly relations with both Japan and the British Empires.46 Lemieux arrived in Japan in the wake of the September 7th, 1907 Vancouver riots. White settlers of British Columbia reacted violently when a ship carrying Japanese passengers (some migrants, some en-route to other ports) made call at Vancouver. Consul General Nosse Tatsugoro, who was also Alexander MacLean's Japanese counterpart in Canada, demanded reparations be made to the injured Japanese. Nosse was a seasoned diplomat with a dual role in Canada, to promote trade between the two countries as Trade Commissioner, but most importantly, to defend and protect Japanese subjects from the at times violent discrimination they suffered in Canada.

A complex web of political compromises permitted racism to inspire new legislation to ban Chinese, Indian and especially Japanese immigrants to Canada, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act47 and the Continuous Journey Act. 48 The so-called Yellow Peril was gaining strength, and British Columbia passed numerous laws, regulations and measures against non-

white and Asian immigrants. Some were aimed at the Japanese in particular, whom were thought to be in direct competition with white economic interests49. The Vancouver riots of 1907 against Japanese nationals damaged relations between Japan and Canada, and eventually prevented the dream of profitable trade with that country from materializing. In the wake of these incidents Alexander MacLean was blamed in part for the decline in trade, and dully reassigned to Shanghai (fig. 10).50

This was the ultimate irony in many ways. Alexander MacLean had gone on the public record repeatedly to promote more equal relations with Japan and the Japanese. He wanted to promote better business relations, which was his mission, and he consistently spoke in favour the Japanese.51 On March 2nd, 1908, a disappointed Ottawa replaced MacLean with a certain W.T.R. Preston, "...a kicker and a pusher of approved quality.",52 in hopes of increasing their commercial profits in Japan. Preston was an aggressive business man whom the Canadian government felt would be better at increasing profits than Alexander MacLean.53 The myth of the Japan market set unrealistic profit expectations that were never met, and by 1911 all pans to continue growing trade and exports to Japan dissipated with Sir Wilfried Laurier's death.

Once in Shanghai, it appears that Mr. MacLean's health deteriorated to the point where he could not perform his duties, and, according to author John D. Meehan, it was Margaret MacLean who worked in his stead until his death on December 22nd, 190854. Margaret MacLean does not mention this sad event explicitly, but has included a menu from her voyage home on The Empress of China (1.591). She has hand-dated it to March 12 1909, a day before her ship docked at Vancouver. An announcement on the Ottawa Journal states that Margaret MacLean held a memorial service for her father at Stewarton Church, in their hometown of Nepean, Ottawa, on March 18th, barely five days after returning to Canada55. Supplemental correspondence found with the scrapbook points to Margaret MacLean relocating to Montreal after her return to Canada, and then travelling around the world before establishing herself in Toronto in 1914, and taking the first steps towards an important career as an educator at The Royal Ontario Museum.

Scrapbooks and Albums at the Turn of the 20th Century
In the last decade of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century, the booming popularization of snapshot photography required its own stage for both presentation and preservation. The purpose-made, slip-in cardboard Carte-De-Visite and Cabinet Card albums of the Victorian era were not suitable to contain the multiple sizes of snapshot photographs.56 As early as the 1870s scrapbooks moved in to fill this gap due to the flexibility they afforded, as their smooth, blank pages allowed for materials to be laid out and pasted in with greater freedom, reflected in the term scrap album used by some magazines.57 More than that, the art of putting albums together was informed by the older, more established American art of scrapbooking. 58 These new photo albums were already borrowing the format from that folkloric art form, and so too would other facets of this art form be transferred to album-makers.

In tracing the transition from the CDV and Cabinet Card album to the modern snapshot album, Dr. Elizabeth Siegel states how the scrapbook fit in this transitory period.59 Due to the increasing variety of print formats and sizes, the scrapbook was uniquely positioned to gather them both for safekeeping and for display. Reflecting the more casual and free way in which snapshots were being made, the scrapbook allowed for new kinds of layouts to take shape. They became highly personal, and reflected more on the life of an individual instead of a whole

family. Quoting author Marilyn F. Motz, Siegel states: "such albums presented women's constructions of their lives as they saw them and as they wished to have them seen by others". Is this a highly personal album of Margaret MacLean? Does it present her life as she wished others to see it? It is very clear that the source material she uses to report on the war is mostly in the English language, or bilingual, Japanese and English, as in the case of the commemorative picture postcards and many of the news clippings. It must also be considered that she may not have had access to Russian materials to include in her book, save one piece of correspondence early on in the scrapbook. It is a letter from a friend now living in St. Petersburg, who makes direct reference to their living in enemy countries. It is possible that this is the only piece "form the other side" that she may have been able to include. It is possible as well that MacLean was sensitive to her father's quasi-diplomatic position, and that she would not include any materials that portrayed Japan or its war efforts in a negative light. This would prove her prudence as a guest of that country.

Professor Patricia P. Buckler contends that scrapbooks occupy an intermediate space between correspondence and memoirs, that scrapbooks are not spontaneous documents created immediately following an event, but rather incorporate reflections on the author's part, and that scrapbooks are cultural products usually authored by women over longer periods of time, with the goal of passing them on to the next generation.60 Margaret MacLean's scrapbook contains a wealth of matter that marks many events in the history of Yokohama and Japan between 1904 and 1915. Some of these events have been largely forgotten, but immortalized in her book, such as the crisis created when Yokohama ran out of drinking water for ten days. Other events are completely absent for the record, such as

the Hibiya Park riots of September of 1905, in which citizens angered by the final terms of Portsmouth Treaty set fire to parts of Tokyo and Yokohama in violence that lasted for several days.61 MacLean also fails to acknowledge in any obvert way the death of her father in Shanghai. Instead, she very subtly includes the ship's menu with hand written notes dating it to the day before she arrived in Vancouver with her father's remains 12 weeks after his death. The final page of the scrapbook is dedicated to Alexander MacLean's work in Yokohama, and makes no mention of his time in Shanghai. In fact, Margaret affirms the good work her father did in Japan with a press clipping stating his merits clearly.

In the exhibition The Family Camera at The Royal Ontario Museum, in the State of the Family section, curators Dr. Deepali Dewan, Dr. Thy Phu, Dr. Jennifer Orpana, Dr. Julie Crooks, Dr. Sara Bassnett, Dr. Sara Parson and Dr. Silvia Forni propose that family photographs are any photographs that occupy a privileged position in the domestic space.62 Is MacLean's scrapbook also a family album? Or is it merely a record of a special time in a far-off land? In the first instance, the scrapbook is an imposing physical object. It is bulky and heavy. It is made of very fine materials, such as silk brocade wrapped covers and heavy card and paper. Its larger dimensions and unusual binding style make it unwieldy to handle without the adequate reverence: the book is meant to be supported properly at all times and its pages turned slowly. The density of the compiled materials demand a careful and detailed study of each leaf. Personal snapshot photographs intersect with mass-produced imagery of different sorts. Affixed fold-outs reveal more photographs and prints. In this way intimate interventions that locate herself in the album create a sense of intimacy. MacLean converts these readily

available and cheap mass reproductions into her own pictures by adding hand-written captions such as "Our gardener looked like this" (1.386) or by marking an "x" on a postcard with "Our house" written right above it (1.308, 1.309 and 1.317). MacLean does indeed transform impersonal photographs into personal ones with this technique. The combination of these factors point to an object that was indeed precious to her, so much so that she waited until 1928 to gift it to the museum. The evidence points to this scrapbook being a special object that accompanied her for decades after its initial creation. This is indeed a visual record of an important shared family experience and it was treated with reverence. Its final donation to The ROM signals a shift in meaning for the object, changing from something personal to something that had historical and social value as a teaching tool.

It is apparent then that MacLean's scrapbook is an object that exhibits the characteristics of both, albums and scrapbooks, overlapping these classifications. It brings together Asian book binding and Western scrapbooking traditions effortlessly. It falls squarely in the transitional time period in which these two forms began to merge, and clearly serves as an appropriate stage for the display of photographs, based on Elizabeth Siegel's descriptions of albums of this era. Her compilation of official commemorative picture postcards closely follows the battles and events of the Russo-Japanese War with accuracy, but not immediacy, despite being compiled in chronological order. She returns to these pages years later with clippings offering additional information to complete the narrative with better quality facts. MacLean revisits other points along the timeline of her Japan experiences, with images, descriptive hand-written captions, longer notes with colourful anecdotes or even fold-out pages with further content (1.137, 1.139, 1.240, 1.271, 1.307, and 1.352). Evidence of this is in her careful notation of the year in which presumably the added information was released. Many press clippings will have a year written

27

in the top-right corner. Others while not explicitly dated, will reveal clues to their output dates in the image or the text copy itself, such as in item 1.351. MacLean did come form a family of journalists after all. Thus it can be seen that materials are arranged chronologically at first, with additional materials added on thematically at later dates. There are two instances in which additional materials have not been added directly onto the scrapbook's surface, but rather on tissue paper. One of these sheets of tissue paper has been affixed to the inside back cover of side 1, and includes a number of newspaper clippings on the death of Emperor Meiji in 1912, four years after MacLean had left Japan. There is another such tissue paper add-on in which more newspaper clippings about the Japanese Red Cross and a translation of MacLean's award certificate are pasted. There is one newspaper clipping that talks about a new Japanese Red Cross hospital in Paris during World War I. That appears to be the latest addition, datable to about 1915. Compiled materials do not seem to originate beyond 1915. While it is not possible to determine with absolute certainty whether MacLean continued to compile after this date, the fact that this latest material is in fact added to an additional, unattached sheet of paper suggests that the scrapbook may have already been filled, or that, at least, MacLean was satisfied with the layout and did not wish to alter it any further. The reflexive nature of her relationship to this scrapbook highlights her desire to remain engaged with Japan long after her departure. It is therefore possible to assume that MacLean intended for others to read this book and her narrative exactly as she intended. This might also signal her intent to use this book in an educational role, adding another layer of meaning to her work.

Scrapbook Description

Is it an album or a scrapbook? The Margaret MacLean Japan Scrapbook is a large accordion-bound book made in the tradition of the Japanese orihon. The orihon is a type of book constructed by binding together leafs of paper which fold in alternate directions. Its earliest origins date from 8th Century China, where various types of this alternating accordion-type binding were used to preserve and store paintings and calligraphy works. These would be pasted onto one side of the orihon. The paintings would later be displayed by opening the orihon like an accordion and resting on its lower side. In the MacLean scrapbook's case, its format and contents overlap into the categories of album and scrapbook. It could be said that it is a photographic album compiled in the manner of a scrapbook, or a scrapbook that is rich in photographic images. While its contents are quite varied in materials and media, the layout composition is sober and modern, a departure from the ornate victorian aesthetic but not quite as stark as the modernist magazines of the 1910s. The orihon book format is an in-between stage meant to preserve scrolls in a codexlike manner.

29

The scrapbook measures 33.5cm long by 38cm wide by 6.5cm deep and it weighs 5.98 kilograms or 12.78 pounds. If it were stretched out, it would measure about 16.5 meters long. It is likely that the orihon itself was purchased in Japan circa 1904, the year Margaret Maclean arrived in Yokohama with her father. On each page are pasted a number of items, mostly photographs, photographic postcards, and other photomechanical reproductions clipped from magazines and newspapers, and it also contains maps, woodblock prints, booklets and other fold outs. These objects were gathered while in Japan, as they relate almost exclusively to specific events during the Russo-Japanese war or to her life in Japan. Many of them are dated by the author or postmarked as correspondence to either Margaret MacLean or Alexander MacLean. This object is made of cardboard and fabric at its essence. Its front and back covers are made of thick cardboard and wrapped in a green and copper-orange silk brocade. Its 36 heavy card leafs fold in alternating directions with fabric hinges. Altogether there are 78 surfaces for the affixing of images and other flat materials. Its covers are joined to the album leafs using a blue fabric that appears to be silk. the blue fabric is affixed to the edge of each leaf. It appears that this originally served to reinforce the paper joint between leafs, but now that these have all but separated over time, these fabric joints act as hinges that fold in alternating directions. There are two sides, a long side that has 38 pages (including the inside front and back

30

covers) and a short side that has 36 pages. Its two sides fully covered with pasted photographs, printed ephemera, and additional tissue pages taped by hand. Many images are accompanied by hand-written captions in ink that provide added information on people, places, events and dates.

How's it compiled? While it is compiled chronologically, some materials pre and post-date MacLean's Japan stay by several years. This suggests that Ms MacLean returned to edit the scrapbook over time, to add relevant clippings and images where she felt necessary. While there may have been some early editing collaboration with her father, there are sufficient items dating from after his death to indicate that Margaret MacLean was the primary compiler. She omits important family events, such as her Father's death and other controversial topics such as the September 1905 Hibiya Park Riots, The treaty of Potsdam and the true purpose of Minister Lemieux's visit to Japan, as well as the motives for her father's transfer to Shanghai. Ms. MacLean crafted a narrative that was deliberately sympathetic to Japan, strayed away from many controversial topics, focused on generally acceptable topics of discussion. Materials for it began to be compiled in the spring of 1904, just before Margaret MacLean resided in Japan while her father was appointed the Canadian Government's Trade Agent to Japan between May 1904 and early 1908. The earliest dated object in the scrapbook is from 1904 and the latest is from 1915. This points to a time period that covers announcements

31

regarding the MacLean's future life in Japan through to Emperor Meiji's death in 1912. What is less certain is the date of compilation. Scrapbooks tend to be compiled in a very conscious manner over a long period of time, often marking important points in the author's life. Ms. MacLean's avid collection of varied pictorial materials suggests she was very resourceful, utilizing items from both mass produced consumer culture and mementos from the exclusive social events of her circle. The extensive use of much older hand-coloured albumen silver prints point to her use of more or less obsolete material that may have been quite inexpensive to purchase. The advanced stages of deterioration of these photographs raise suspicions as to their true date of origin in the early 1900s, and may in fact be left-over stock from the 1880s and 1890s. Much of this material can appear to be more ethnographic in nature, but was already firmly rooted in the Yokohama Shashin tradition first seeded by the work of influential Western photographers based in Yokohama63, such as Felice Beato, Baron Raimund Von Stillfried and Japanese masters such as Kusakabe Kimbei and Kozaburo Tamamura. Evidence of definite compilation time is not readily apparent in the scrapbook itself, however, a wet stamp on the inside front cover marks the date October 30th, 1928 as the day it was accessioned into the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology's care. It is thus clear that the compilation could not extend past this date, and a date of 1904 to 1928, while generous, serves as the earliest and latest possible dates of compilation. The fact that the oldest items in the scrapbook date from 1915 suggests that MacLean made a conscious choice not to include any more Japan-related content after the first year of World War I until the time she gave the scrapbook to the museum. It must be noted that the scrapbook does not contain material unrelated to either the Russo-Japanese war or to life in Japan during the Meiji Period, therefore in terms of subject matter, it encompasses the late Meiji Period Japan.

How did it come into the ROM? The scrapbook was a gift of Miss MacLean to the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology made on October 10th, 1928, four years after her retirement. This indicates that the book was considered differently from other scrapbooks MacLean left to the museum, which she used in her education work as teaching aids. It is evident from its dimensions, binding style, weight and remarkable state or preservation, that this book would not have been a practical teaching aid for the scores of lectures Miss Maclean conducted at the museum during her tenure, but that it was much more likely a precious book to her.

What else came with it? A number of lose postcards may have come into the collection along with this book, as many of them are duplicates of the official commemorative Japanese postcards already within the scrapbook. There are additional cards from Europe and South Asia that form part of this loose postcard collection. Some of these were posted by MacLean to her brother Donald in Toronto, with explicit instructions to save them until she returned from her travels. Other postcards were sent to her by friends and acquaintances living or traveling around the world. The earliest postcard dates from 1903 and the latest from 1926. It isn't clear if this group of cards came in at the same time as the scrapbook, as there is no documentation recording this, however, they are housed in a separate box next to the scrapbook. Margaret MacLean also

33

gifted other items to the museum, including Korean ceramics, textiles and her younger brother's military medals.

What condition are the photographs in? The photographs in the album are affected by a number of deterioration issues. First and foremost, they are all susceptible to deterioration related to inherent chemical instability, that is to say, various mechanisms of degradation due to the materials they are affixed on, next to and against. The materials the scrapbook itself is made of, its binding structure and how it does or does not protect against deterioration agents in the environment, and the non-photographic materials also compiled in it all affect the various types of photographs in different ways. There are three main types of photographic images, and three main types of photomechanical reproductions. Within the photograph types there are (in order of quantity):

Â· Hand-coloured albumen silver prints, dating mostly from the 1880s and 1890s. Â· Collodion POP prints Â· Gelatine silver POP prints
Photomechanical reproductions are:

Â· Hand-coloured, duotone and monochromatic collotypes. Â· Halftone images from newspapers and other publications. Â· Offset lithographs.
Here are the deterioration agents acting on each type of photographic and photomechanically reproduced object and examples for illustration purposes:

34

Photographs: Hand-Coloured albumen silver prints suffer from yellowing and fading. objects 1.573 and 1.585 are examples of severe cases of fading, where the image is very hard to see due to density loss, revealing the details of the hand colouring. Several albumen prints also suffer from cockling due to adhesive application, such as 1.83, 1.122, and 1.163. A number of images are also plagued with creasing. This is largely due to how and where they are affixed onto the various leafs when they open and close. All of the albumen prints suffer from one degree or another from striations, which is inherent to that medium. The degree of deterioration also points to a much earlier production time than the scrapbook compilation, and exposure to detrimental environmental conditions for extended periods of time. Japan is notorious for its long, hot and humid summers. Collodion POP prints are few in number, but are in remarkably excellent shape in terms of image density and the absence of surface damage. However, 1.440 and 1.444 suffer from cockling. 1.440 also suffers from creases due to an unglued side of the picture being in close proximity to the edge of the leaf. The rest of the collodion POP images are of smaller dimensions but some suffer from small lacunas on their edges and others also suffer from cockling and creases. Gelatin silver prints are all affected from the two general patterns of silver mirroring: around the edges, which points to environmental conditions as the catalyst, and all-over silver mirroring, which indicates direct contact with an acidic object for prolonged periods of time. objects 1.444, 1.151 and 1.152 are examples of all-over mirroring, showing that they have been in contact with acidic objects. In the opposite it is evident that a column of hand-coloured

35

collotype postcards have been the objects against which these photographs have been in contact with.

Photomechanical Reproductions In general, collotype postcards make up a large percentage of all photographic images compiled in the album, and hand-coloured collotypes make up the majority of postcards. All collotypes have excellent image layer permanence, as this photomechanical process is rendered in ink. The associated deterioration mechanisms with them are physical in nature, as they are in contact with objects on the opposite leaf while the scrapbook is closed. Because of the card stock they are printed on, which is acidic, they pose a threat to objects susceptible to damage from higher acidity. It is important to note that a significant number of collotype postcards have been trimmed from their original dimensions to fit the author's layout. Clippings with halftone images are quite brittle, especially those printed in newsprint. this type of paper is very acidic and has yellowed and turned almost brown in some cases. Many of these clippings are in direct contact with other printed and photographic material, acceleration deterioration such as silver mirroring, staining and embrittlement. Many of them are creased or have had pieces from the edges break away over time. Last, but not least of the photomechanical reproductions are the off-set lithographs or compound lithographs. Being ink-based, their images are quite permanent and the colours of their inks appear to have held up. Like other paper-based objects, the stock they're printed on can be acidic, leading to accelerated deterioration on object in close contact with them.

Preservation and Access Strategies
Where does it "live"? Currently, the scrapbook is stored in a lid box in the World Cultures Department's Far Eastern collection vault, where other Bishop White Committee Library of East Asia rare books requiring controlled storage environments are also stored, and is listed in its catalog as a manuscript. Tracking its provenance since accession has been a difficult. As mentioned earlier, the scrapbook was a gift from Margaret MacLean to the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology (ROMA) on October 31st, 1928, but it does not appear to have been accessioned as a collection object. Beverly Stapells mentions the scrapbook being in the Library of East Asia in 1975. 64 Thus it seems that it has been kept in the custody of two different collecting bodies within the museum. Both are tasked with the access and preservation of this book. It is considered both a library book and a collection artifact, creating a complex administrative context. The photographs and photographic objects are only now being accessioned into the ROM's Asian photograph collection, while the book itself, the correspondence, news article clippings and other written matter remain under the Bishop White Committee Library of East Asia care.

What are the challenges of preserving this book? There are several serious risks to the preservation of this object, and they relate primarily to handling issues. First of all, because of its size and weight, most pages cannot be fully open without

37

placing undue stress on the cloth binding the leafs together. Adequate support must be placed underneath the book, such as angled foam blocks to ensure the pages are not open flat. Because the book has no real spine, support must be adjusted with the turning of each page, as this changed the thickness of each half of the book. Secondly, there are a significant number of fold-outs pasted onto the leafs. Some of these have been further folded due to poor awareness and care while turning the leafs. The new folds are rather harmful to more sensitive material like poor-quality newsprint paper, and a number of these have broken off. Prior to rehousing into a single zip bag, the loose material in L sleeves that was left in place where it was found within the book would slide out, and increase the risk of folding or bending. Thirdly, turning the book around is not easy due to its size and mass. The risk of a dropping it is high if the handler treats it like a regular spine-bound book. Fourth, there are a number of different materials in direct contact with each other. High-acid newsprint pulp has stained some of the other ephemera it faces on the opposite page. Some of the silver gelatine prints have faded quite significantly, while others are in remarkable condition.

How is it accessed? It is currently accessed by request to Dr. Deepali Dewan, Dan Mishra Curator of South Asian Art and Culture and curator of the Asian photography collection and The Family Camera Archive at The ROM, or through Dr. Max Dionisio, Head Librarian of the Bishop White Committee Library of East Asia, or through Dr. Brendan Edwards, Head of the ROM Library and Archives. The scrapbook is not in circulation, but it is listed on the University of Toronto Libraries

38

website search results65. The scrapbook has been viewed in the Far Eastern Collection Vault, the Far Eastern Archives room, the Far Eastern Library reading room, and the Library and Archives reading room, four different locations for as many different audiences. Conservators, photography scholars, biographers and students have requested access to this object.

How is it preserved? The scrapbook is currently wrapped in tissue paper, housed horizontally in an archival box and placed in the Family Camera Archive stacks. In the same box are housed a first edition copy of MacLean's book on her China travels: Chinese Ladies at Home, as well as a rare book on the Russo-Japanese war, gifted to her by the general manager at the Grand Hotel in Yokohama, as well as some copies of articles on her work at the museum, her father's appointment as the Canadian Government's Trade Agent to Japan, two recently acquired handtinted collotype postcards. Loose ephemera and photographs found inside the book have been individually housed in clear polyester L sleeves and stored together in a polyester zip bag.

What will be cataloged? The album, photographs, photomechanical reproductions, woodblock prints and some of the letterpress and hand-painted invitations are being accessioned into the museum's photography collection. A careful selection of cataloguing fields was drawn up that is in keeping with established ROM cataloging fields and adapted for this unique object. A total of 12 fields were chosen for this record. The controlled vocabulary from The Getty Research Institute's Art & Architecture Thesaurus authority were the preferred terms for these records.

1. Accession number: This is based on the ROM's current cataloging system, structured as 2016X49.1.1, where the first four digits represent the year the object is accessioned, the X represents a special status and the next two digits refer to the donor. The next two digits refer to the group number, and final period separated numbers address the object itself. In the MacLean scrapbook's case, 1.1 refers to the album itself, and 1.2 refers to the first image within the book. For the purpose of this paper, only the last two digit groups will be used, that is to say, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, etc, while the preceding accession numbers are being determined by the Registration department. 2. Object name: The common object name goes here, for example, photograph, relief halftone, postcard, invitation card and so on. The terms used here are those in common usage already in the photography collection. 3. Curatorial Title: This titled is descriptive in nature, whenever possible of both the image and the object if it is necessary. 4. Maker: The attributed creator or contributor, may include the photographer, the person who commissioned the work, the publisher or, in case it cannot be attributed, the term `unknown' 5. Geography: This field identifies the location where the object was made. Where the location cannot be determined precisely, the country name alone is used. 6. Materials and technique: The media the object is created with, for example Hand coloured albumen silver print or collodion DOP print based on The Getty terms. 7. Output date: This field refers to the date of publication or printing of the photographic object itself, and not the date of the events depicted in the image layer. Dates are expressed as either a range of years, circa a particular year, century or part thereof, or a specific date based on direct evidence on the object or its associated event.

40

8. Dimensions: These fields contain the length and width of a photographic object or print, and whenever possible the thickness as well. The measurements are recorded to two decimal places where appropriate. 9. Description, Inscriptions and Curatorial Notes: This combined field tracks a) overall description statements of the image and/or object for quick identification, b) notations that are either printed with the object or handwritten by the compiler where practical to include in the record, that is to say, usually no more than two sentences in length, and c) original research notes that serve to expand or clarify understanding related to events, locations or personages connected the object.

Based on these cataloguing fields, a catalog record will resemble the following example:

The digitization process The Royal Ontario Museum's dedicated photography department is headed by Bryan Boyle. It counts with state-of-the-art facilities, equipment and digital asset management systems in place for the acquisition of top-tier digital images from artifacts. These are used for publications, catalogs, media and other high-visibility uses or when high resolution images are required. To offset demand on the studio for everyday needs, departments have their own, smaller studios where they can photograph artifacts for internal needs. Such is the case in the Far Eastern Department where I worked. This smaller facility is used for the quick

41

documentation of its objects, and serves as the first step in the digitization of artifacts. The Far Eastern Department also has scanners available for materials that require it.

The first step in making this album usable, is to digitally photograph it and its contents. While lower resolution images no greater than 300kb are the maximum allowable for the database to work, I created high resolution files from which derivatives were made. Using departmental equipment: a copy stand, a NIKON D5500, a set of lights, a scale ruler and a colour card I captured images following the in-house standard, that is at 300dpi, 24bit color depth, 6000 x 4000 pixels dimension. These high-resolution originals are stored locally on a departmental workstation, as there are tightly regulated storage restrictions on networked resources.

During the digitization process I was able to see all of the photographs and quickly appraise their general condition. A great deal of them have faded substantially, others are plagued by silver mirroring and others experience various other deterioration issues in different degrees. The acidic nature of the support paper and inadequate storage environment conditions account for the bulk of the degradation damage. There are other issues of yellowing and brittleness with newspaper clippings, some correspondence has been folded intentionally or inadvertently. There is a lot of discolouration and spotting in many of the paper-based items. Folded items present a particular challenge to photograph, as their dimensions sometimes extend far beyond the album pages. There are also items which are glued on top of others, and finally a number of folded pamphlets and booklets that need to also be photographed page by page.

42

Coming up with an initial logical way of doing this was clunky, but I decided on the following procedure: First, use the copy stand already in use by the department. Due to the album's dimensions, it was most practical to photograph one page of side at a time. I intellectually divided the album in two sides, recto and verso. I then subdivided each side into odd and even page numbers. As I finished with the odd pages, I would rotate the album so that the even pages could be photographed. As the album is fragile and susceptible to handling damage, I placed it on a sheet of mylar, and I would move the album by handling this layer.

I photographed whatever I saw when I opened the album. Where there were folded ephemera, I would then unfold the item and photograph its recto and verso if they remained flat on their own. Sometimes I used a glass sheet weight that allowed me to flatten and photograph the item. Some correspondence was neatly folded inside its envelop, which was glued to the page. It was carefully removed, unfolded and then photographed, sometimes with the aid of the glass plate weight. Wherever I found a broken-off piece of paper, I would place it inside a mylar sleeve or polyester bag, and re-place it where I found it and photographed it. The process required a few hours and the periodic readjustment of camera settings, book supports and other lighting corrections. Various methods were tried to reduce glare on glossy or silver-mirrored photographs when problems arose. In the end some pages had to be photographed a number of times to compensate for some of these factors, but this number was limited, taking into consideration that post-production time was also limited. The work was completed in a day, and the digital photographs were moved to a local desktop for review. I was able to see the level of detail of each image on the scrapbook and determined that it was sufficient to meet the database image standards.

43

The idea for a surrogate copy created from these digital files that would reduce physical handling on the scrapbook emerged right away. After considering several approaches to creating this digital surrogate, I settled on an approach in part inspired by the orihon format itself. That is to say that I looked at the original purpose of the orihon format, which was to preserve scrolls in a more accessible format. I decided to do the reverse, and to "unfold" this orihon scrapbook into two scrolls, one each for the recto and the verso sides. There were a number of post-processing steps that needed to be undertaken in order to create a continuous file that would approximate the unfolded state of the scrapbook.

The first step was to go through the image files and re-name them, so that the images would be in the correct sequence to match the book, and not match the in-camera capture order. Due to the the scrapbook's dimensions, the copy stand lights configuration provided limited usability. Odd and even pages were shot in separate sequences and in reverse orientation. The files were renamed in the following fashion: MM_SB_S1_L1.*; where MM stands for Margaret Maclean, SB for Scrapbook, S1 for side one and L1 for leaf one. Side and leaf numbers would change as the sequence progressed. Once the files were renamed, the reversed images were rotated to the correct orientation. The files for each side were saved on separate folders labeled Side1 and Side2 respectively. Thus I ended up with an orderly sequence of images for each side.

The next step was to correct for slight perspective distortions. I took measurements using the ruler photographed with the scrapbook and created a guide grid that would allow me to stretch the image in such a way that I could "square" all four corners to each other using Adobe Photoshop. At this time I also corrected the white balance and exposure for each image and made other minor image adjustments like finer rotation corrections.

44

Step three required the stitching of two adjacent album leafs together into one doublespread. I proceeded to create a canvas on photoshop where I could have two leafs side by side. I copied and pasted each leaf side by side in he order they appear in the album. I overlapped them at the visible seam, and made some fine-tuning adjustments to clean up the joining edges. Each double spread file was then named S1_spread1, where the number values would change in sequence order. These files were then saved in subfolders named Spreads. The following step in the process involved stitching together each spread to each other in sequential order. The creation of a large canvas was required, and it was at this point that I had to make an important decision as to what to exclude from the digital surrogate at this early stage. Namely, I did not include multiple views of the fold-outs, nor did I include images of the additional paper tissue pages that were affixed at later dates, nor did I include the loose materials found stacked together inside the album. They were not necessary for the proof-ofconcept initial prototype I had in mind, and they were thus left out. The question stayed in mind though, as to how to present these excluded items in future versions. It was decided then to create a canvas that was 38 times the length of a leaf, plus a little extra cautionary margin for side one of the digital surrogate. In a similar fashion to the creation of the double spreads, I dropped onto this canvas each sequential double spread file and joined them at the seams, repeating blending steps to make the joining edges appear natural. all the layers were then collapsed and the image flattened to reduce the file size. It would only safe as a tiff file because of its unusual dimensions (16.5 meters wide), and has a data size of nearly 500 megabytes, This whole process took about four weeks of after-hours work outside of my internship. I was satisfied with this initial model, and could now see it scroll across my computer screen at will. The 300 dpi resolution was clear enough to make all text and detail readable with ease. I felt that this file could not just serve as a research surrogate, but also as the basis of an interactive display piece that would live in a gallery exhibition or digital blackboard panel for

45

public access. The idea to integrate the images with their catalog record to facilitate meaningful interactions was born during this process.

The challenge that arose from this model for an enriched digital surrogate was it incompatibility with the TMS database system, which is being implemented by the museum to make their collections accessible through the E-museum platform. While the digitally applied scroll format makes the scrapbook's timeline easier to navigate, its component images are not easily integrated into TMS, and print outs or hard copies re-introduce the problems of scroll storage and preservation that orihon were designed to solve. Therefore, the digital surrogate took on a much more conventional form. Each album leaf was separated, trimmed and processed individually, and saved with filenames that reflected their placement in the scrapbook, for example, S2L2.*. When dealing with fold-outs, the file dames were given the following form: S2L6_1.*, S2L6_2.*, S2L6_3.*, where the final number expresses a view of the same page. the same approach is used to to denote different views of the album/scrapbook itself. Each one of these files was compiled sequentially into a large PDF file. This file starts with several object views of the album/scrapbook, and is then followed by the image of each leaf, starting with side one, inside cover and sequentially through to the end of side two, leaf 36. After that, it is followed by the loose ephemera and photos found between the album leafs. It is on this PDF file at each of the selected photographic and pictorial objects are given a catalog number that matches the catalog record. Wherever possible, these numbers are placed on the top-right of the image, and are inscribed on white rectangles with red borders to highlight them. This PDF document was then printed, and a hard copy resides with the album/ scrapbook in its housing, to reduce the amount of direct handling of the object itself. A hard copy of the catalog record is also housed with the album/scrapbook. The housing of these two printed

46

documents with the object is meant to greatly reduce physical damage stemming from repeated handling.

47

Conclusions
A total of 597 printed photographs, photomechanical reproductions and printed images have been individually cataloged and processed for upload to The ROM's TMS database for both, increased accessibility and digital preservation. A digital surrogate in Portable Document Format (PDF) with various object views and individually numbered images also resides on the network storage, and a hard copy of the same lives with the scrapbook in the vault, along with the corresponding hard copy of the catalog record. The author's compilation and editorial process have been analyzed using current frameworks, revealing a chronological order of events, evidence of reflection on these, and the discovery of a suppressed personal narrative. Finally, recommendations for suitable handling procedures and physical preservation have been written and developed for this precious object.

It exists on different planes as a scrapbook, album, historical document and a potential educational resource due to its format, construction, author's intent and the materials compiled within. Furthermore, as a privileged object, first in the MacLean's Yokohama home, and later in Margaret's home, it also functions as a personal family album. Because it was created at a transition period in the nature of photo albums between the 19th and 20th centuries, it occupies a place in photographic history that reflects the evolving design aesthetics of North American scrapbooking as it embraced photographs.

The variety of material culture objects compiled in MacLean's scrapbook reflects the popularity and accessibility to photomechanically reproduced images, true photographs and other pictorial media for mass consumption available to non-Japanese residents of Yokohama in the first decade of the 20th century. In part spurred by the newly permitted creation of

48

photographic postcards, demand for photographic images of the Russo-Japanese war, the album is mostly made up of hand-tinted collotype postcards, followed by older hand-tinted albumen silver prints, letterpress halftone images, gelatin silver and collodion prints and a handful of woodblock prints. Using hand-written captions and notes she transforms commonplace images not only into a testimony of her experiences and descriptive account of Japan and its people. MacLean also described her privileged experiences through written accounts in her personal correspondence, and published articles in Canadian newspapers of the time. The Margaret MacLean scrapbook demonstrates how the appropriation of impersonal, mass-produced images can convey personal narratives effectively.

Measures for the long-term care and preservation of The MacLean scrapbook have been accomplished by combining traditional and digital preservation methods. A custom-made archival storage box, and selective interleaving have been implemented to mitigate inherent vice deterioration. A handling guide has also been included to reduce the risk of handling damage. This physical damage is drastically reduced by using a full-colour hard copy surrogate with numbered images linked to the catalog record. This helps users identify the images to be accessed in the scrapbook. The scrapbook's digital surrogate allows for greater access through The ROM's new TMS database system and its E-Museum web pages.

Finally, it is clear further research remains to be done to answer questions about photographers identities, studios, publishers, and precise material dating. There is also the question of cataloguing the objects outside the scope of this project, namely newspaper clippings and correspondence. In addition, the latest in digital tools can be used to incorporate cataloguing data about this album to illustrate and chart the narrative, further revealing the album's organizational structure and intention. There is a wealth of knowledge still to be

49

unlocked from this singular work, and further insights to be gained about Margaret MacLean, her life and times in Japan.

Appendix C: Integrated Timeline 1903 to 1909
History of Photography
1903 - Meiji 36
The Cherry Portable, the first portable Japanese camera, is made by Konishi Honten (forerunner of Konica). The box-shaped camera used a magazine which held twelve 2 1/4 x 3 1/4 in. dry plates. Konishi Honten went on to make various other cameras. Paper-backed roll films were still not made in Japan. Only sheet film and glass plates were being made in Japan. Imported roll films were still very expensive and usually arrived in poor condition because there were no refrigerated cargo holds. Japan's first photographic paper, the Sakura Hakkin type paper, is marketed by Konishi Honten.

Geo-political Events

Jan

Margaret MacLean appears to have led a typical middle-class Canadian woman's life up to this point, participating in home, community and religious life.

206

The Kodak Folding Pocket Model 3A camera is introduced this year. It yielded postcard-size negatives (3.25 x 5.5 inches / 83 x 139 mm). Kodak distributed its photo print papers, both the "Velox" and (after 1904) the cheaper "Aso" brand, precut to the same size, with the standard postcard grid format printed on the backs.

Feb Canadian Agriculture Minister Sydney Fisher sent to Japan to oversee Canada's exhibit at the National Industrial Exhibition in Osaka, and to hold informal talks on trade and immigration with Japanese officials.  Canada experiences great success at National Industrial Exhibition. Fisher and Grey discuss exporting wheat to Japan Fisher reconsiders joining the Anglo-Japan Alliance

1904 - Meiji 37
In Shashin Geppo, budding art photographers assert that photography could be used for self expression, not just for recording reality. Shashin Reidaishu, established by Kuwada Shokai (a photo supply shop), held monthly photo contests promoting art photography.

207 Shashin Reidaishu, established by Kuwada Shokai (a photo supply shop), held monthly photo contests promoting art photography. Photographer Jack London is arrested for taking unauthorized photographs of Japanese army training. Jack London is first photographer to capture pictures of battle at Pyongyang.

New camera clubs emerged to establish photography as an art form. One group was called Yutsuzu-sha, with core members KUNO (AKIYAMA) Tetsusuke, KATO, Seiichi, and SAITO Taro. They advocated pictorialism in photography, with the same possibility of self expression as in painting.

Appendix E: Recommendations

The number one action to take is to immediately reduce the amount of handling of this object, and to ensure that those who handle the book do so properly. The age, condition, dimensions, proportions and weight of this object make it challenging to handle and therefore special care must be taken when handling it. A combination of physical and digital preservation strategies will reduce deterioration and damage due to improper or excessive handling.

Recommendation 1: Create an access tracking log sheet to create a record of activity around the scrapbook. This can help ascertain when damage occurs, but also increases accountability. This access log would record date, time, user name and pages or leafs accessed. It will be accompanied by a printed handling guide inside the scrapbook's housing, outlining the correct way to handle it. This guide lets users know what precautions to take, issues to be aware of with delicate, fragile or brittle contents and what tools to use in the safe handling and consultation of the scrapbook. Such a guide is included in Appendix G.

Recommendation 2: In close consultation with the museum's paper and guest photographic conservators, it has been determined that the best way to help mitigate the effects of chemical deterioration of the most vulnerable photographs is through the use of selective interleaving strategies. Using either tissue paper or polyester film sheets can protect prints and photographs in close proximity to acidic materials from further chemical deterioration. However, this strategy must be limited, as 

220

interleaving adds bulk that deforms the scrapbooks natural shape, places undue stress on the fabric hinges, and reduces this scrapbook's overall stability when handling.

Recommendation 3: The most significant way in which handling can be reduced is by creating a high-resolution surrogate than can be consulted prior to accessing the scrapbook itself. This surrogate should be digital for remote and on-demand access, and also printed as a hard copy to be used in the collection storage area: - Digitize the scrapbook with high-resolution digital photographs to record its condition and where loose objects are found within the scrapbook. - Create a derivative digital surrogate PDF format file of the scrapbook with these images, with relevant object catalog numbers included for reference. - Compile a master catalog record in spreadsheet format from which to upload to database and create other derivative files and print-outs. - Hard copies of the PDF surrogate and the catalog record are to always be in close proximity to the scrapbook, and must be consulted before accessing the object to minimize handling and potential damage to its fragile components..

Recommendation 4: Physical handling should only take place when absolutely necessary, and only in such cases where other surrogate materials, both digital and hard copies do not suffice in aiding research. For example, when the album needs to be physically experienced as an orihon.
