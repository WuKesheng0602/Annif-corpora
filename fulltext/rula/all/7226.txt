A Proposed Enzyme-Linked Hydrogen Peroxide Radical Assay System (HORAS) EunJee Park Master of Science, Molecular Science, Ryerson University, 2017 ABSTRACT Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) are chemically reactive molecules that contain oxygen. ROS are naturally generated as a byproduct during mitochondrial oxidative metabolism as well as by cellular responses to a variety of inflammatory stimuli. Intracellularly formed ROS plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis and in cell signaling but, ROS are challenging to quantify. Phagocytic cells such as macrophages may produce H 2O2 during the action of bacterial engulfment. Here UV-Vis versus LC-ESI-MS detection methods for an enzyme-linked, cellular assay of H2O2 production in cultured macrophages are compared. In the presence of Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP), Amplex Red (AR) reacts with H2O2 in a 1:1 stoichiometry to produce the redfluorescent oxidation product resorufin that can be measured by UV/Vis at an absorbance of 570 nm or by LC-ESI-MS at 214 m/z [M+H]+. RAW 264.7 macrophages were stimulated by microscopic foreign particles, with the addition of 0.1mM of Amplex Red substrate and 10 ng/mL of HRP to the cellular media to enzymatically detect H2O2 production. The oxidation product resorufin can be detected by the colorimetric method as low as 50 pmol while liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization and mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) was able to detect as little as 0.2 pmol in vitro. Thus, it was possible to measure low levels of H2O2 released by cells using an enzyme coupled cellular assay with LC-ESI-MS.

CHAPTER 1: Introduction 1.1 Reactive Oxygen Species Atomic oxygen is inclined to accept electrons and form reactive oxygen species due to the unpaired electrons in the outer electron shell. There are six different kinds of reactive oxygen species (ROS): Oxygen, superoxide, peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, and hydroxyl ion. Molecular oxygen is crucial for the survival of aerobic organisms. Aerobic energy metabolism is dependent on complete reduction of a molecule of oxygen to water which requires four electrons and several sequential intermediates. These intermediates are considered as ROS, and ROS are highly reactive compared to molecular O2. The most common ROS in cells are Superoxide, Hydrogen peroxide, and Hydroxyl radical. 1.1.1 Oxidant Sources

Mitochondria ROS include several reactive molecules and free radicals derived from one or more unpaired electron oxygen molecules. All aerobic cells produce ROS, such as superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical in various enzymes and organelles within the cell. Cells produce ROS as a byproduct of many metabolic reactions in the mitochondria, peroxisomes, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and particularly in the setting of ER stress (Halliwell & Gutteridge, 1984). Mitochondria may be a major site of ROS production in response to physiological reactions under aerobic conditions (Chance et al., 1979). During mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, Complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) and Complex III (Q-cytochrome c oxidoreductase) transfer a single electron to the oxygen molecule. Thus, superoxide anion (O2.-) is initially formed by the electron transfer chain in inner mitochondrial membrane (Turrens et al., 1985). Superoxide anion can be converted to H2O2 by an enzyme called super oxide dismutase (SOD) which is located

in the intermembrane space of mitochondria (McCord & Fridovich, 1969 and Weisiger & Fridovich, 1973). About 0.1% to 0.5% of mitochondrial O2 consumption leads to H2O2 production enzymatically or spontaneously (Bayne et al., 2005 and Boveris et al., 1972). NADPH oxidases Reactive oxygen species were initially considered as unwanted by-products of other biological reactions since they were known to cause cell membrane and DNA damage. However, Sbarra and Karnovsky (1995) first observed a sudden increase in oxygen consumption during phagocytosis which was dependent on glucose metabolism. The NADPH oxidase complex is the primary enzyme system which is responsible for respiratory bursts (Rossi & Zatti, 1964). Superoxide anion (O2-) production occurs during phagocytosis via the NOX2 complex, also known as gp91phox, as part of their essential role in host defense (Babior et al., 1973 and Teahan et al, 1987). All NADPH oxidases (NOX) enzymes are composed of six highly conserved transmembrane domains which contain two hemes, NADPH and FAD binding regions at the COOH terminus (Bedard & Krause, 2007). In phagocytes, NOX2 and p22phox are found in both intracellularly and in plasma membranes with four cytosolic proteins (p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and Rac). During phagocytosis, NOX2 assembles by recruiting cytosolic proteins, exchanging GDP to GTP on Rac, to become an active enzyme complex (Holmström & Finkel, 2014). Phosphorylation of the cytosolic p47phox allows interaction with p22phox and leads to the recruitment of other cytoplasmic subunits, p67phox and p40phox, to form the active NOX2 enzyme complex. The active form of NOX2 transports electron from cytosolic NADPH to extracellular or phagosomal oxygen to generate superoxide anions which is also known as the respiratory burst (Bedard & Krause, 2007).
2

Other Enzymes Mitochondria and NOX enzymes are well characterized intracellular sources of ROS. Studies have shown various enzymes such as xanthine oxidase, nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenases, cytochrome p450 enzymes, and lipoxygenases can also produce trace amount of ROS (Holmström & Finkel, 2014). Similarly, peroxisomes and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) may also produce ROS depending on cell type. 1.1.2 Antioxidant Defense Systems

Different intracellular concentrations of ROS may have various biological effects. ROS may serve as signaling molecules. For example, concentrations of 10-8M of H2O2 is involved in growth signaling while concentrations of 10-4M of H2O2 leads to apoptosis (Stone and Yang, 2006). ROS homeostasis is essential since imbalanced ROS may damage macromolecules including; DNA, protein, and lipids. This damage may cause cell damage or death. In order to counterbalance the production of ROS, cells have Antioxidant Defense Systems (ADS) to scavenge excessively produced ROS. ADS can be divided by enzymatic antioxidants and non-enzymatic antioxidants. Enzymatic Antioxidants Enzymatic antioxidants work by breaking down and removing free radicals. The major antioxidant enzymes are superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase that maintain the cellular reductive potential and each antioxidant has distinct functions. Two superoxide molecules are converted to H2O2 and O2 by SOD. Three different isoforms of SOD; CuZn-SOD, Mn-SOD, and EC-SOD have been identified (Zelko et al., 2002). CuZn-SOD is a copper and zinc-containing homodimer found in intracellular cytoplasmic spaces of mammalian cells. The tetramer form of

3

Mn-SOD is exclusively found in the mitochondrial spaces of aerobic cells while EC-SOD was first identified in the extracellular spaces of human plasma (Zelko et al., 2002). Catalase is a well-recognized antioxidant enzyme that is found in nearly all aerobic organisms. Catalase is mainly localized in peroxisomes but is also found in the cytosol of human neutrophils and alveolar macrophages to catalyze the composition of H2O2 to water and oxygen (Davies et al, 1979). Another enzyme that responsible for the reduction of H2O2 is glutathione peroxidase (GPx). GPx are a family of tetrameric enzymes that dependent on the micronutrient selenium (Se) at the active site and uses low-molecular-weight thiols, such as -glutamylcyseinylglycine (GSH), to reduce H2O2 via the following reactions (Imai & Nakagawa, 2003): Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx): 2GSH + H2O2  GSSG +2H2O Non-Enzymatic Antioxidants Non-enzymatic antioxidants work by interrupting free radical chain reactions. A few examples of the non-enzymatic antioxidants are vitamin C, vitamin E, and GSH. The water-soluble antioxidants including vitamin C (ascorbic acid) are present in cellular fluids such as the cytosol, or cytoplasmic matrix by scavenging oxygen free radicals (Birben et al., 2012). The lipid-soluble antioxidant vitamin E is found in cell membranes and protects against oxidant induced membrane injury. Vitamin C and vitamin E can be activated by GSH which is localized in all compartments. GSH is the major soluble antioxidant, and can function as an antioxidant in numerous ways (Nimse & Pal, 2015). GSH reduces hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. In addition, GSH is a cofactor for detoxifying enzymes such as GPx. The oxidized form of glutathione (GSSG) is reduced, and so recycled, by glutathione reductase (GRD) enzymes, with NADPH as a reductant:

They are distributed throughout mammalian organs and their morphology varies depending on their state of activity. Phagocytosis Cells have a variety of ways to internalize particle and solutes such as pinocytosis, receptor mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis. Phagocytosis, first observed in 1884 by Ilyich Metchnikoff, is the uptake large particles (>0.5 m) into cells by actin-dependent mechanisms (Aderem & Underhill, 1999). Phagocytosis occurs by sequential interactions between macrophages surface receptors and opsonic ligand on surfaces of particles. Oxidized Low-Density Lipoprotein produces Reactive Oxygen Species in Macrophages Oxidized Low-Density Lipoprotein (oxLDL) is generated from native LDL that plays a role as a cholesterol transporter and accumulates in atherosclerotic lesions in humans (Yia-Herttuala et al., 1989). The accumulation of oxLDL in atherosclerotic lesion causes atherosclerosis (Liu et al., 2006). Macrophages scavenger receptors such as CD36 bind and engulf accumulated oxLDL and become foam cells that induce inflammatory reactions within the arterial walls which, also contributes to atherosclerosis (Yang et al., 2007 and Itabe, 2009 and Han & Nicholson, 1998). A previous study showed that an 8 hour treatment with 20 g/ml of oxLDL increased ROS generation in RAW264.7 cells causing an increase in NOX2 mRNA expression and protein levels (Lee et al., 2014). Thus, production of intracellular ROS by a signaling cascade through NOX family NADPH
5

oxidases may act as a second messenger in the inflammatory response. Studies have shown that oxLDL stimulates phagocytosis in macrophages causing activation of inflammation signaling molecules (Bae et al., 2009 and Lee et al., 2014). Physiological Role of Hydrogen Peroxide All aerobic cells have various enzymes to eliminate H 2O2 since it is toxic to cells and damages macromolecules. Despite its toxicity, cells produce H2O2 for a variety of functions in cells. Only phagocytic cells use H2O2 as a defense mechanism since phagocytic cells may depend on H2O2 to help degrade engulfed particles (Baehner et al., 1975). Recent studies have shown that H2O2 is also produced in response to activation at the cell surface, which may function as an intracellular messenger in cells. Unlike other messenger molecules, H2O2 is a ubiquitous intracellular messenger that oxidizes critical residues of effector protein to activate various function in cells (Woo et al., 2010). In general, H2O2 responds to different signaling pathways depending on the cell type, the magnitude of the dose, and the duration of the cell exposures. When H2O2 concentration is 10 -8 to 10-7 M, cells proliferate (Giorgio et al., 2007). 10-7 to 10-5 M of H2O2 can cause either temporary or permanent growth arrest, while oxidative stress (10-4 M of H2O2) causes cell death by apoptotic or necrotic mechanisms. Oxidative stress is highly studied since it may cause diseases such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, pulmonary fibrosis, neurodegenerative disorders, arthritis, and aging (Finkel & Holbrook, 2000). Thus, it is important to quantify and track the small diffusible H2O2 molecules in live cells.

1.3 Hydrogen Peroxide Detection Method To clearly understand cell signaling events, it is important to accurately detect and quantify ROS like H2O2. Several techniques and analytical approaches such as fluorescence and chemiluminescence have been used to detect H 2O2. Fluorescent probes There are many methods that have been examined to measure H2O2 in real-time. An effective way to measure H2O2 is using Amplex Red (AR) in the presence of Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP). Non-fluorescent molecules of AR are converted to highly fluorescent resorufin by reacting with H2O2 at a stoichiometry of 1:1 when HRP catalyzes an H2O2 dependent oxidation (Figure 1.1). This assay is sensitive to 2 pmol of H2O2 (Mohanty et al., 1997). HRP has a high catalysis rate and yield but, it is also one of the least specific enzymes of the peroxidase family thus HRP could utilize many cellular compounds including thiols for its substrate.

Figure 1.1 Non-fluorescent Amplex red is oxidized by the horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide to highly fluorescent Resorufin (Dikalov, Griendling, & Harrison, 2007) Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) is also commonly used to detect intracellular H2O2 and oxidative stress. DCFH-DA is a cell permeable non-fluorescent probe that can be hydrolyzed by intracellular esterases (Kalyanaraman et al., 2010). Two electron oxidation
7

of DCFH forms the fluorescent product dichlorofluorescein (DCF) (Figure 1.2). DCF can be monitored by several fluorescence-based techniques such as confocal microscopy and flow cytometry which allows for the measurement of H2O2 concentration over time. However, the intracellular redox chemistry of DCFH is complex and the DCF assay has several limitations to measure intracellular H2O2. As Figure 1.2 shows, DCFH does not directly react with H2O2 to form DCF, and therefore cannot be used as direct measurement of H2O2. In addition, redox active metals such as Fe2+ with presence of H2O2 can oxidize DCFH to form DCF results in amplification of fluorescent signal intensity (Karlsson et al., 2010).

Figure 1.2 Cell permeable DCFH-DA is cleaved by intracellular esterase to DCFH and oxidized by hydrogen peroxide to the fluorescent molecule (Dikalov et al., 2007). Chemiluminescent probes Commonly used chemiluminescence probes are lucigenin, luminol, MCLA [2-Methyl-6(4-methoxyphenyl)-3,7-dihydroimidazo[1,2-a] pyrazin-3-one, hydrochloride] and coelentarzine. To measure superoxide, lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescene (LEC) may be used since it is reasonably specific for O2·- and its signal is linear. LEC are also easily detected by a scintillation counter or a luminometer (Dikalov et al., 2007 and Rost et al., 1998). Lucigenin-amplified chemiluminescence reactions are as follows (Faulkner & Fridovich, 1993):
8

Reaction. 1: O2·-+ LC2+LC·++O2 Reaction. 2: LC·++O2·-LCO2 Reaction. 3: LCO22N-methylacridone+h

The lucigenin radical can react with O2·- to form NMA and a photon (Figure 1.3). However, O2·- production can be overestimated by redox cycling (Rost et al., 1998). In addition, chemiluminescence based assays are easy and specific for superoxide but other ROS can only be measured by use of inhibitors.

Figure 1.3 O2·- reduces lucigenin (LC2+) to its cation radical (LC·+). Cation radical reacts with a second O2·- to form the energy-rich dioxetane molecule (LCO2) and results in emitting of a photon (Vladimirov & Proskurnina, 2009). The enhanced chemiluminescence luminol dependent (ECL) assay is another attractive analytical method to measure H2O2 since it is highly sensitive with a fast reaction time. The chemiluminescence of luminol can be catalyzed by different catalyst compounds such as copper (II) and hexacyanoferrate (III) in hydrogen peroxide assays (Steijger et al., 1996 and Yoshida et al., 1999). Several studies have found that ECL has a great potential to measure H2O2 by providing
9

more intense, prolonged, and stable light emission proportional to H2O2 concentration. In basic media in the presence of catalyzers and oxidants with the addition of an electron rich compound (enhancer), luminol emits light at 425nm (Bhandari et al., 2010; Ramos et al., 2001; Navas et al., 1996) (Figure 1.4).

Figure 1.4 Luminol oxidized by hydrogen peroxide with presence of HRP to the fluorescent molecule. The amount of light detected is proportional to the hydrogen peroxide concentration. Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) Electron spin resonance (ESR) or also known as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is formed by a microwave generator, a resonator, and electrical magnets (Figure 1.5). ESR is an analytical technique based on absorption of microwave radiation stimulated by an electromagnetic field in molecules such as free radicals and transition metal ions with unpaired electrons (Dikalove et al., 2007).

10

Figure 1.5 A typical ESR spectrometer is formed by a resonator cavity surrounded by a pair of electrical magnets and a microwave generator that emits radiation towards the cavity (Dikalove et al., 2007). The unpaired electrons are excited to a high-energy state under the magnetic field by the absorption of microwave radiation ((Dikalove et al., 2007 and Konhno, 2010 and Lee et al., 2012). The excited electron changes its direction of spin and relaxes to ground state by emitting energy. The transition between two different energy levels takes place by absorbing a quantum of radiation of frequency in the microwave region. Microwave absorption is measured as a function of the magnetic field by ESR spectrometer. Although ESR is extremely sensitive and specific it is extremely expensive and requires certain probes such as cyclic hydroxylamines (Lee, et al., 2012). In addition, an ESR spectrometer requires an extra antioxidant or inhibitor experiment to verify presence of H2O2 since some other reaction may yield the radical products or oxidant which result in amplification of the ESR signal. New Methods for H2O2 Detection Previous studies have shown that oxidation of AR by HRP produced fluorescent resourfin that can be detected by liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry
11

(LC-ESI-MS) (Florentinus-mefailoski, Safi, & Marshall, 2013). Resorufin was analyzed by HPLC-MS and SIM at 214m/z results in the log linear dilution curve as low as at 200 fmol on column. The combination of enzyme-linked H2O2 radical assay and LC-ESI-MS can yield sensitivity to the fmol range with reduction of quantification and detection limit. Rationale and Objective Reactive oxygen species detection in macrophages has always been challenging due to the lack of techniques that are sensitive for low-level detection at the cellular level. The objective of this work was to apply liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization and mass spectrometry in order to monitor H2O2 concentrations in cultured macrophages in response to inflammatory signals. Oxidized AR products can be detected by liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization and mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS) at 214 m/z [M+H]. Thus, the mass spectral detection method to an enzyme coupled cellular assay may provide greater sensitivity and simplicity to measure H2O2 in live cells.

Tris-HCl were purchased from BioShop. MaxiSorp 96well plates were obtained from Nunc (ThermoFisher Scientific). Cell culture flasks and 6well culture plates were obtained from Greiner Bio One. PVDF membrane was obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA). The solvents of optical grade were obtained from Caledon Laboratories (Georgetown ON, Canada). The LTQ ion trap was obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham MA, USA). The HPLC was from Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara CA, USA). 2.2 Method Substrate reactions HRP (1mg/ml) was made to 50% glycerol and stored at -20 °C. Amplex red (AR) 5 mg was dissolved in dry dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and aliquots were stored in the dark at -20 °C. Amplex red was mixed in the reaction buffer (Tris 20 mM, pH 8.8) with a final substrate concentration of 0.1 mM. A total of 10 ng/ml of the HRP was added to reactions for time course measurements. The substrate and enzyme were mixed just prior to the addition of the H 2O2 solution. For enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), luminol was dissolved in dry DMSO and stored at -20 °C until dissolved in Tris buffer (pH 8.8) and reacted in the presence of 4 -iodophenylboronic acid and 10 ng/ml of the HRP with addition of different concentration of H2O2 mixed just prior to the detection.

Cell Culture RAW 264.7 cells were grown to 50% confluence in 75 cm flasks with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were plated at 25% confluence in 6-well plates for 72 hours prior to assay; 1mL of ~50% confluent cell culture per well. Prior to the experiment to reduce the presence of extraneous growth medium proteins, the cells were washed with PBS for three times. Isotonic experimental medium (20 nM HEPES, 5 mM glucose, 140 nM NaCl, and 1mM of each CaCl2 and MgCl2) were added. Lipoprotein Isolation and Oxidation A total of 0.4451g KBr and 0.9 mL of normal human plasma were mixed into a Beckman 3 mL ultracentrifuge tube (McFarlane et al., 2005). A 0.196M solution of NaCl was gently run down the side onto the top of the plasma without disturbing the layers that occurred. Ultracentrifugation was performed at 4C, at 100,000 rpm for 1 hour with an acceleration and deceleration setting of six. After ultracentrifugation, LDL was transferred to a 2 ml O-ring tube using 21G needle and, placed into the 0.5mM EDTA containing PBS dialyzed at 4C for overnight (Shen et al., 2008). Oxidation was performed using isolated LDL placed in PBS containing 5 M CuSO4 at 37C for 18 hours. To terminate the reaction 0.3 mM EDTA and 40 M butylated hydroxytoluene was incubated and dialyzed at 4C for overnight. Modified LDL was dialyzed extensively at 4 C against PBS containing 0.5 mM EDTA. Prepared oxLDL (~ 0.0125 mg/l) was stored in the dark at 4C. Preparation of IgG coated beads 15 L of 10 mg/mL human IgG dissolved in PBS was combined with 1.5 L of 2 m particles made of melamine resin (Fluka, Sigma-Aldrich, Product of Germany), diluted in 500 uL of 1 x phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and incubated for 30 min prior to washing three times after
14

pelleting IgG coated beads at 148,000 rpm, and after removing the supernatant containing unbound IgG. IgG coated beads were re-suspended in 50uL of PBS. Preparation of oxLDL coated beads The same procedure was used to produce oxLDL coated beads as the IgG coated beads however the oxLDL coated beads were incubated in the dark due to light sensitivity. Enzyme reactions in 6 wells AR (0.1 mM) and 10 ng/ml of HRP were added into 6 well plates where cells were grown. There were different treatments: beads, beads coated with IgG, beads coated with oxLDL, oxLDL coated beads with 500 units/ml SOD and 1000 units/ml catalase, 1 M PMA, 1 M ionomycin, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and H2O2. Sodium orthovanadate, SOD (500 unit/ml) and Catalase (1000 unit/ml) were added 30 minutes prior to addition of 0.1mM AR and 10 ng/ml of HRP. Each treatment was incubated for 30 minutes and stored at 37ºC and 5% CO2 in the dark. After 30 mintues, reactions were quenched by placing onto ice. Colorimetric Detection The oxidation of non-fluorescent AR by HRP in the presence of H2O2 was monitored by UV/Vis spectroscopy. AR reacts with H2O2 in 1:1 stoichiometric ratio to produce resorufin that can be detected colorimetrically. The plate was read on the microplate fluorimeter (Multiskan spectrum, Model number 354, Thermo labsystems) at 570 nm after 30 minutes of incubation by transferring 200 uL of supernatants into 96 wells. Enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) detection In the case of ECL, the limit of sensitivity for H2O2 was measured by adding 10 ng/ml of HRP and ECL solution (1.25 mM of luminol and 2.5 mM of enhancer) into 96 well plate with different

concentrations of H2O2 and detected by Bio-Rad gel doc system as well as microplate reader (Synergy HTX, BioTek Instruments, Inc, Winooski, USA). The amount of generated light is proportional to H2O2 concentration. To test limit of sensitivity using ECL, dot blotting 10 ng/ l of HRP onto methanol-activated PVDF in the presence of 1.25 mM luminol and the enhancing agent 2.5 mM of 4-iodophenylboronic acid and with detection by BIO-RAD gel doc (Haan & Behrmann, 2007). Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Ionization Mass spectrometry A 1ml volume of 0.1mM AR reacted with H2O2 at a stoichiometry of 1:1 with 10 ng/ml of HRP to yield oxidation product, resorufin. To concentrate and desalt the resorufin from the media, 200 L of supernatant was collected by zip-tipping. To equilibrate the C18 ziptip (EMD Millipore) was pipette up the 65% acetonitrile (ACN) with 5% FA buffer for ten times and washed in 5% formic acid (FA) for ten times. To collect resorufin, the 200 L supernatant was pushed through the resin bed 20 times before washing in 5% FA. Resorufin was eluted in 65% ACN with 5% FA in 2 L. The resorufin was diluted 10-fold in 5% formic acid. The LC-ESI-MS analysis was performed by manual injection of 20 L of the sample via an Agilent 1100 high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) pump set at 70% acetonitrile and 30% water to a final of 0.1% acetic acid as the ionization buffer flowing at 10 L per minute at 5 kV over 15 cm x 300 um of normal phase column. Statistics Data shown are the means of blank ± 3Standard deviation (SD) for limit of detection or means ± SE of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate as indicated in the figure legends. Comparison between control and treatment was made using t test (P  0.05) or comparison
16

between groups by one-way ANOVA (P  0.05) followed by a Tukey test or two-way ANOVA (P  0.05) was used to compare difference of each treatment of H2O2 production by the statistical analysis system R. A value of P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

CHAPTER 3: RESULTS 3.1 Determination of Optimal conditions for Amplex Red Assay Before using a colorimetric method, the reaction conditions were optimized and demonstrated linearity with respect to time, HRP, and H2O2 standard curves in vitro (Figure 3.1, Figure 3.2, Figure 3.3). The lowest detection limit for HRP was 10 pg and safe detection limit was above 50 pg (Figure 3.2). Similarly, using the optimized reaction, H2O2 concentration was measured from 0.25 M to 1 mM and a linear relationship was found between 0.25 M to 100 M of H2O2 concentration and absorbance at 570 nm, with a correlation coefficient of 0.99. Using the AR and HRP reaction, 0.05 nmol of H2O2 can be measured (Figure 3.3). The limit of safe detection for quantification (LOQ) was computed using blank of Mean+3SD=0.061. The lowest safe detection limit was 0.5 nmol H2O2.

3.2 Detection of H2O2 production in RAW 264.7 After determining the optimal concentration of AR, HRP, and H2O2 for experimentation, it was applied the optimized conditions to measure H2O2 in RAW264.7 cells. A phagocytic cell can be stimulated by microscopic foreign particles such as aggregated oxLDL and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) opsonized bacteria or by soluble stimulants such as PMA or chemotactic peptides such as N-formly-met-leu-phe. Different treatments were used to elicit an oxidative response including: melamine beads, beads coated in IgG, beads coated in oxLDL, ionomycin, PMA, cytochalasin B & N-fromyl- met-leu-phe, and sodidum orthovanadate to investigate whether the cells could be stimulated to release measurable amounts of resorufin by fluorescence at 570 nm. When RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with PMA for 5min incubation, it showed significant increase of H2O2 production. Since catalase and SOD are the main mechanisms for conversion of super oxide to H2O2 and then H2O, SOD and catalase were added in 30min prior to addition of the treatment (oxLDL coated beads). When macrophages were treated with oxLDL coated beads and PMA, they produced the highest absorbance of resorufin compared to oxLDL alone, beads alone, and sodium orthovanadate (Figure 3.10). The confidence intervals using the Tukey method for oxLDL coated beads and oxLDL coated beads with SOD and catalase comparisons yield showed biologically significant difference (Figure A. 1). Figure 3.10 demonstrated that results are biologically significant using R. One Way-ANOVA test resulted in F(5,83)=10.91, p=4.35e-0.85. Multy-way ANOVA test resulted in F(5,83)=10.911, p=4.351e-08. However, blank of mean + 3SD was 0.0574 and all treatment was not above LOQ except treatment with PMA. Using the line of the best fit (y = 19.206x + 0.0187) generated from the H2O2 standard curve, the yield of H2O2 in each treatment was computed (Figure 3.11).

3.3 Determination of Optimal Conditions for ECL Experimentation Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) is simple and highly sensitive method to measure H2O2. To conduct an ECL experiment in order to investigate sensitivity compared to enzyme-catalyzed oxidation of AR assay, three different methods were compared to test the sensitivity of ECL measurement. When the ECL method was used, the lowest detection limit for H2O2 and HRP were 10 nmol of H2O2 per 200 L and 2 ng/ml HRP compared to Amplex red-HRP assay which allowed us to detect 0.2 nmol of H2O2 per 200 L. The ECL method measured by Bio-Rad gel doc or BioTek microplate was not very sensitive. In addition, immobilize HRP was detected by the ECL method using PVDF and measured by Bio-Rad gel doc showed a much higher ECL signal. Up to 10 pg of HRP could be detected, but using the ECL method only 0.1 mM H2O2 was detected (Figure 3.15). The ECL method is a simple and sensitive method to measure HRP in the presence of excess H2O2 but was not sensitive at low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide.

3.4 Detection of H2O2 production in RAW 264.7 using LC-ESI-MS To determine the sensitivity of resorufin, the liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization and mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) at 214 m/z [M+H] was used. The concentration of resorufin from 0 nM or from 100 nM to 10 M was injected through a 2 µL loop into a mobile phase of 70% acetonitrile and 30% water to a final concentration of 0.1% acetic acid as the ionization buffer flowing at 10 µL per minute at 5 kV over 15 cm and 300 µm ID normal phase (300Å) column. LC-ESI-MS allowed for the detection of 0.2 pmol amounts of resorufin ( Figure 3.16). Relative abundance computed to obtain the line of the best fit (y=6939.9x+602.91, R2=0.997) and the LOQ was 0.2 pmol (Blank of mean+3SD=2.53E+04) (Figure 3.17). In order to avoid an extra step of ziptipping for sample clean-up, EtOH extraction was tested and showed that resorufin recovery was less than 50% (Figure 3.18). Before injecting resorufin from cellular media into LC-ESI-MS, resorufin was collected using a ziptip. A 1ml volume of 0.1 mM AR reacted with H2O2 at a stoichiometry 1:1 with 10ng/ml of HRP to yield the oxidation product, resorufin. The yield of resorufin in an H2O2 dependent reaction by RAW cells in response to different ligand coated beads in the presence of Amplex Red (AR) and the enzyme Horse Radish Peroxidase (HRP). To concentrate and desalted the resorufin from the supernatant, 200 L of supernatant was ziptipped and 2 l of eluent were diluted 10 folds and in injected via a 20 µL loop for analysis by LCESI-MS (Figure 3.20). The relative abundance shown by bar graph and blank of mean+3SD was 479,240 and the treatments were not above the LOQ. One Way-ANOVA resulted in F(6,21)=1.969, p=0.116. Multy-way ANOVA resulted in F(6,21)=1.969, p=0.1163 using R (Figure 3.21).

CHAPTER 4: DISCUSSION The aim of this research was to determine whether H 2O2 in live cultured cells could be monitored by a combination of enzyme-linked H2O2 radical assay UV/Vis, ECL and LC-ESI-MS. An enzyme coupled reaction used the exogenous addition of the enzyme HRP and the substrate AR to detect trace amounts of H2O2 by macrophages during rest versus phagocytosis. In the presence of HRP, AR reacts with H2O2 in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio to produce the red-fluorescent oxidation product, resorufin. The large amount of ROS produced by human neutrophils in response to N-fMLP or PMA may be measured by the oxidation of AR. Hence, the oxidation of AR by HRP should produce a direct measure of H2O2. Previous studies have shown that barely detectable amounts of H2O2 are produced by macrophages by the oxidation of AR. Five replicates of the experiment were conducted where PMA, Sodium Orthovanadate, and oxLDL coated beads were presented to RAW 264.7 cells to compare the mean absorbance at 570nm. The comparison of AR, hydrogen peroxide/peroxidase UV/Vis assays ruled out future use of ECL that was not sensitive to low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. The yield, sensitivity, quantification and detection limit of the enzyme-linked H2O2 assay and LC-ESI-MS of were compared to AR and the hydrogen peroxide/peroxidase assay in vitro as well as in vivo. The UV/Vis versus LC-ESI-MS showed both qualitative and quantitative differences with respect to measured oxidation of AR in response to PMA. 4.1 Characterization of Sensitivity for Detection of H2O2 The enzyme-catalyzed oxidation of AR assay is a simple and sensitive method for measurement of the H2O2 production from RAW264.7 cells. This method allows detection of 5pmol H2O2 per 100 l in a 96-well fluorescence microplate in vitro assay (Zhou et al., 1997). Although enzymecatalyzed oxidation of AR assay is a sensitive method for measurement of H 2O2, the signals were

44

not strong and were typically below the safe limit of detection and quantification (LOQ). The lowest concentration of H2O2 that can be detected may give a reading not clearly resolved from the baseline. Our experiment showed lower than 0.5 nmol of H2O2 per 200 l was below the LOQ to safely quantify yield of H2O2 in live cells. In addition, the LOQ for H2O2 using ECL was 1nmol of H2O2 per 200 µl. As it was expected, the limit of sensitivity for the detection of H 2O2 can be achieved by as little as 0.2 pmol per 2 L using LC-ESI-MS. 4.2 Measurement of H2O2 Production Macrophages are scavenger cells capable of phagocytosis. The measurement of the H2O2 production during phagocytosis in RAW 264.7 cells was measured with the Amplex Red Hydrogen Peroxide/peroxidase assay. The powerful carcinogenic substance PMA can directly activate protein kinase C (PKC) to activate NAPDPH oxidase (Swindle et al., 2002). When we RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with 1M of PMA for 5 min, a high level of H2O2 (MeanSE: 819  5.26E-05 mol) was produced. Swindle, Hunt, & Coleman (2002) identified superoxide as the major source of ROS after 3 to 7 minutes incubation with PMA using pholasin-dependent chemiluminescence. The inflammatory ligand oxLDL may activate macrophages and increase H2O2 by macrophage-derived foam cells (Karunakaran et al., 2016 and Rajagopalan et al., 1996). The treatment of macrophages with oxLDL induced the production of H2O2 350 mol/L to 450 mol/L (Sukhanov et al., 2006). Similarly, our result showed that when macrophages were incubated with oxLDL, they produced up to 170 mol (MeanSE: 170  2.09E-05 mol) of H2O2 per 200 L. Solid aggregates of oxLDL can activate macrophages and trigger inflammatory phagocytic activation leading to the release of free radicals and create more oxLDL. Microbeads were coated with oxLDL to and used in a phagocytosis assay (Vance et al., 2016). Solid aggregates
45

of oxLDL can activate macrophage engulfment and produce H2O2 (Mean SE: 250  2.15E-05 mol) as measured by the production and accumulation of resorufin. The signal was specific as demonstrated by the addition of catalase and SOD. The SOD and catalase enzymes lowers superoxide concentration by catalyzing the superoxide into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen while catalase promotes the degradation of H2O2 to O2 and H2O. Addition of SOD and Catalase prior to addition of oxLDL coated beads, macrophages decreased production of H2O2 (MeanSE: 0.185 mol  8.33E-06). When macrophages were incubated with oxLDL for 2 hours, intracellular catalase activity increased while activity of SOD remain consistent (Sukhanov et al., 2006 and Hultén et al., 2007). Macrophages upregulate catalase activity to restore ROS balance in response to oxidative stress (Hultén et al., 2007). 4.3 Luminol Dependent Chemiluminescent ECL is sensitive and quantitatively detects H2O2 since luminol oxidized by HRP using H2O2 in 1:1 stoichiometric to produce aminophthalate with light emission detectable to the 0.2 nmol level. The ECL assay allowed detection of HRP up to 0.01 ng and the LOQ for H2O2 was 10 nmol of H2O2 per 200 µl. It is clear from our data that ECL is not as sensitive as by mass spectrometry combined enzyme-catalyzed oxidation of AR assay. Although some studies suggested another enhancer such as Diogenes to increase sensitivity, it did not mention the LOQ to be comparable to our method (Yamazaki et al., 2011). 4.4 Mass spectrometry Fluorescent resourfin can be detected by applying liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) at 214 m/z [M+H] to an in vitro reaction (Florentinus-mefailoski et al., 2013). Resorufin from the cellular media in 0.1% formic acid
46

produced an intense peak at 214 m/z by LC-ESI-MS using isocratic HPLC and SIM. The collection of resorufin from 20 L of cellular media analyzed by LC-ESI-MS at 214 m/z [M+H] was not above LOQ. The resorufin from a larger volume of cellular media may have to be concentrated to provide a signal that is well resolved from baseline. Tyrosine phosphorylation was involved in the activation of the macrophage respiratory burst (Bassal et al., 1997). Sodium orthovanadate is a phosphor-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitor that enhance the respiratory burst in neutrophils or macrophages (Green, Hamilton, & Phillips, 1992). Studies showed that tyrosine kinase activity increased by PMA which is associated with the respiratory burst (Bassal et al., 1997). Previously, the addition of vanadate prior to triggering the respiratory burst, enhanced the effect of the tyrosine kinases activity resulting in an increase in respiratory burst but had no effect in our experiments. There was an apparent increase in absorbance at 570 nm in response to treatment with PMA even after centrifugation (Figure 3.10). but no effect of PMA was observed by LC-ESI-MS. Many studies have showed that PMA induced accumulation of RNA and enzymes that are related to oxygen-dependent metabolism and apoptotic cells (Dolgushin et al., 2013). Thus, it was proposed that PMA induced cell secretion that cannot be removed by centrifugation at 14800 rpm and may interfere the absorbance of the resorufin while measuring intensity at 214 m/z using LC-ESI-MS was not effected by PMA induced cell secretion. Thus, further experiments are required to determine the source of the discrepancy between UV/Vis versus LC-ESI-MS.

CHAPTER 5:CONCLUSION If the ROS generated in cells can be measured and analyzed precisely, it can be employed to evaluate immune function in response to ligands and drugs. In this study, a novel enzyme linked cellular assay to detect H2O2 produced by cultured macrophages during the phagocytosis of oxLDL coated beads by the exogenous provision of Amplex Red and HRP monitored by LC-ESI-MS. In the presence of HRP and Amplex red, the H 2O2 produced by the cells reacted in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio to produce the red fluorescent oxidation product, resorufin that may be quantified by LC-ESI-MS. Resorufin can be detected by fluorescence using excitation of 570 nm and emission of 585 nm at 0.5 nmol to 1 nmol level that showed a safe detection limit similar to ECL. The small amount of H2O2 produced by cultured macrophages, while biologically significant, was below the limit of safe detection and quantification by UV/Vis methods. The quantification of resorufin by LC-ESI-MS at 214 m/z [M+H] allowed for detection as low as 0.2 pmol level. Although, quantified H2O2 production level by macrophages in response to the inflammatory ligands from 20 µL were not above the LOQ, there was a trend to greater H2O2 production with inflammatory stimulation. The mass spectral detection method to an enzyme couples cellular assay is a useful tool for sensitive detection of H2O2 in cells. Thus, it can be widely applied in biochemical research and in clinical trials for H 2O2 detection techniques. Future Work LC-ESI-MS is a very sensitive method to detect as low as 0.2 pmol of H2O2. However, zip-tipping 20 L of resorufin from cellular media with 20 L injection into LC-ESI-MS is not sufficient. It is believed that increasing the volume to 1ml of cellular media collected over C18 with 20 L injection loop will allow for the quantification or H2O2 above the LOQ.
