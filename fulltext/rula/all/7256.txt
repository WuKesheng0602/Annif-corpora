TRAFFIC SIGNAL COORDINATION FOR WELLINGTON STREET WEST, TORONTO, ONTARIO Sharareh Shadbakhsh Master of Engineering , 2017 Civil Engineering, Ryerson University Toronto, Canada

Abstract

The increasing volume of traffic in cities has a significant effect on road traffic congestion and the travel time it takes for road users to reach their destinations. Coordinating traffic signals, which is a system of light that cascade in sequence where a platoon of vehicles can travel through a continuous series of green light without stopping, can improve the driver's experience significantly. This report covers the development of a coordinated traffic signal system along Wellington Street West from Church Street to Blue Jays Way Street as part of a City of Toronto signal coordination project. The objective of this study is to improve coordination through modification of signal timing plans while maintaining reasonably minimal impacts to the side street levels of service and delays. The overall goal is to reduced travel times, delays, number of stops and fuel consumption, resulting in public benefit.

Introduction

Traffic signal progression or coordination aims to provide a wave of "green lights" on corridors. Under the direction of the City of Toronto, this study was completed to improve the coordination of traffic signals along Wellington Street West from Church Street to Blue Jays Way Street. The objective of this report is to analyze the existing conditions in terms of traffic flow and traffic operation. It further identifies deficiencies and provides solutions to improve the measure of effectiveness. This goal would be accomplished by conducting a comprehensive study of the existing conditions as well as developing alternative analysis along with recommendations on new signal timings for the study corridor. The study corridor includes 8 signalized intersections as illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1:Study Area

All the intersections in this study are operating under TransSuite control system. TransSuite traffic control system is a family of transportation management software products. It relies on a second-by-second communication system that also displays real-time graphical information. It depends on site equipment where it can maintain coordination up to one day in its memory in case of communication loss. TransSuite does not control the traffic movements by itself; however, it sends commands to the controller to follow the timing plans [1].

City of Toronto uses six mode of control to operate traffic signal that includes: fully-actuated (FA), fixed-time (FXT), semi-actuated (SA), semi-actuated pedestrian (SAP), semi-actuated vehicle (SAV), and pedestrian-actuated (PED). The mode of control (MOC) for intersections is all of fixed (FXT) type. Mode of control of an intersection refers to the type signal operation. The mode of control at City of Toronto is determined based on the off-peak vehicle and pedestrian volume. The fixed mode of operation refers to an automatic change of signal direction from the main street to side street and vice versa [2]. Detailed intersection information is shown in Table 1.

Data Collection Review and Site Observation
Data Collection Review
Turning Movement Counts

The Turning Movement Counts (TMCs) were provided by the Traffic Safety Unit (TSU) at the City of Toronto. Refer to Appendix A for the summarized TMCs and Peak Hour Factors (PHF). The traffic movement counts data for many of intersections were older than two years, so comprehensive volume balancing was conducted to account for imbalanced volumes. Details on volume balancing can be found in section 3.1. 2.1.2 Traffic Signal Timing Plans

Signal timing plans were collected from the in-house Pedestrian Crossing (PX) folders. The PX folders contain a comprehensive history of each of the signalized intersection. Every PX number corresponds to a unique intersection with information including signal timing plans, public request for review of the timing plan and other events that have contributed to the current state of the intersection and signal timing plans. These signal timing plans were used in the development of the base Synchro model. Signal timings for the study intersections are provided in Appendix B. 2.1.3 Intersection Drawings

The intersection drawings were collected from available PX folders in the ITS department cabinets, since no electronic version of these drawing were available. Google Earth and Mirasan tools were used to verify the critical distances, lane configuration, and storage lengths. Field measurements were done at the locations where inconsistency was observed. 2.1.4 Posted Speed Limit

The posted speed limit along Wellington Street West from Church Street to Blue Jays Ways Street is 50 km/h.

2.1.5

Adjacent Land Uses

Wellington Street passes through the Financial and Entertainment districts. These consist of commercial, institutional and open space land uses. 2.1.6 On-Street Parking

Generally, on-street parking is prohibited during rush hour for most of the intersections, however, taxi stands are provided between Bay Street and York Street during rush hour. 2.1.7 Pedestrian and Cyclist Activities

The presences of pedestrian and cyclist are notable in the following intersections which can be found in TMC tables in Appendix A:   2.1.8 Bay Street at Wellington York Street at Wellington Construction Area ­ Temporary Construction Timings

Temporary construction of condominium building was taking near the north side of the Yonge and Wellington intersection. The westbound right turn lane was fully occupied with construction and site materials, resulting in reduced number of lanes for westbound movements. This observations were taken into account for a more accurate model calibration.

2.2

Field Observations

The focus of the observation during AM, OFF and PM peaks was to identify locations with queue spillback, queue blockages, significant long queues, stop-and-go conditions, high pedestrian activity, pedestrian impedance, long delays generated by transit vehicles, and approaches and movements where vehicles required more than one cycle to pass through the intersection. Consideration for the implementation of advance left-turn phases will be made, based on observations, and later confirmed within the Synchro model. Field observations were completed by the author of this report in April 2015. Details of field observation can be found in Appendix C.

2.3

"Before" Travel Run Study

In order to create a baseline for the existing traffic condition, travel run and delay survey were conducted in the west directions of the Wellington Street. A minimum of 5 runs per direction, per period, per day, was required. This resulted in a total of 15 runs per direction, per period. The `before' runs were conducted on the following two weekdays:   Tuesday, April 21/2015 Wednesday, April 22/2015

By reviewing the available intersection turning movement count data the `before' runs and delay survey were conducted during the following time periods on each day:    2.3.1 AM Peak: 7:00 ­ 9:30 Off Peak: 10:30 ­ 14:30 PM Peak: 15:30 ­ 6:30 Travel Time and Delay Study Analysis

This section focuses on the study of corridor travel time and delay using Global Positioning System (GPS) and Test Vehicle Techniques. The travel time study provides information and data on the amount of time it takes to travel a segment of a road. In conducting the travel time study the "floating car method" was applied using GPS equipment and software illustrated in Figure 2. With the "floating car method", drivers attempt to travel with the flow of traffic by changing lanes to pass as many cars as they are passed by [3].

5

Figure 2: Equipment Setup for GPS Test Vehicle Technique

As five to six runs per direction per peak period per day was the requested minimum sample size for the busiest two hours, some runs with partial lane blockage were still included in the delay analysis. To ensure that the travel time variances caused by partial lane blockages were acceptable in the delay analysis, the confidence level of each survey study per direction per peak period (i.e., 15 runs) was reviewed. In this study, PC-Travel software was used for travel time and delay analysis with the source of GPS data collection [4]. Based on the confidence level calculations in PC-Travel software, the `before' surveys obtained a sufficient sample size (i.e., 15 runs) that realized 95% confidence (permitted error of approximately 2.0 km/h to 5.0 km/h). [3] Appendix D provides the reports generated by the PC-Travel software. These reports record the following four traffic performance (MOEs) from the `before' survey:  Travel time ­ time required to travel between upstream and downstream intersection measured from stop bars;    Average speed ­ average speed recorded between upstream and downstream intersection; Stops ­ average number of times that the vehicle speed dropped below 8 km/h; and Total delay ­ total time recorded when the vehicle speed dropped below the normal travel speed of 50 km/h. The average field measurements of the MOEs are summarized in

Base Synchro Model Development and Adjustments

To analyze the current traffic signal operations a base model was constructed in Synchro 7 and Simtraffic. Synchro is a macroscopic traffic analysis tool based on the methodology outlined in the Highway Capacity Manual (2000) [5]. It is used for signalized intersections and has the capability to optimize the signal timing and offsets. Simtraffic is a traffic simulation software which performs microsimulation of the expected traffic flows [6]. In this study, the base models were developed for peak periods of AM, OFF Peak and PM during the weekdays only and imported to Synchro software. The purpose was to examine existing operations using current traffic signal phasing and timings, intersection turning movement, traffic count data and other associated road network information. The following shows a summary of steps taken for creating the base Synchro model:

1. All signalized intersection nodes have been added and the intersection spacing has been confirmed using Google Maps. 2. Nodes have been numbered per the PX numbers. Lane configurations at the intersections and pedestrian crossing have been coded based on intersection drawings. 3. The signal timing plans have been coded using the existing TransSuite timing cards available in PX folders. 4. Vehicle volumes have been balanced as explained in Section 3.1 5. Volume parameters have been coded based on traffic counts including pedestrian volumes, cyclists, heavy vehicle percentage and peak hour factor. 6. To reflect the real traffic better, the City's Peak Hour Factor (PHF) reports were inserted for each movement for AM and PM period. However, for the OFF Peak period the PHF number was manually calculated according to the following formula from Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2010 [7]:  4  15

 =

Where Vh the hourly volume and V15min is the highest 15-minute count.

7. Permit Right Turn on Red (RTOR) based on the field regulations 8. The "Referenced to:" field in the Synchro model was adjusted to "Begin of Green:" for all MTSS Controllers, as well as TransSuite Controllers operating Econolite and PEEK 3000. The "Referenced to:" field in the Synchro model was adjusted to "TS2 ­ 1st Green" for all TransSuite Controllers operating EPAC and PEEK ATC-1000.

3.1

Volume Balancing

As part of the Base Synchro Model development, volume balancing between adjacent intersections is required by the City for this project. This step was done using the following methodology as provided by the City:

1. Identify locations that have a volume imbalance greater than 10% 2. Determine land uses and presence of access within the areas where imbalances are greater than 10% 3. Based on the land use, accesses and local knowledge, determine if the imbalance is justified 4. If the imbalance is not justified, then volumes will be balanced using the major/major intersection as a reference for balancing the smaller intersection within 10%, using the following assumptions: 5. If Major/Major volume is greater than adjacent Major/Minor intersection volume, then increase the Major/Minor through volume 6. If Major/Major volume is less than consecutive adjacent Major/Minor intersection volumes, then increase the Major/Major volume 7. If Major/Minor is imbalanced with consecutive adjacent Major/Minors, increase or decrease accordingly 8. In general, Major/Major volumes should not be lowered to accommodate volume balancing Figure 3 illustrates an example of volume balancing for the off-peak period from the intersection of Church/Wellington to Yonge/Wellington.

9

Figure 3: Volume Balancing Example

The imbalance volume of vehicles exiting Church/Wellington and entering Yonge/Wellington is larger than 10% and, since there is no major access point or justification, volume balancing is conducted by reducing the volume of westbound through movement vehicles by 200 (from 1137 to 937 vehicles) at Church/Wellington. This results in an imbalance of 8.3% as seen in Figure 3. It should be noted that volume balancing is only conducted for through movements. Please refer to Appendix E for all other intersections.

Calibration Methodology and Validation of the Synchro Model

For the development of the calibrated model, guidelines from City of Toronto [8] and Highway Capacity Manual [7] were used and followed; however, any exception to the procedure and the guidelines are specified in the next section.

4.1

Calibration

The base existing Synchro model needs to be calibrated to reflect the observed site conditions. Therefore, intersections with over capacity conditions (V/C <1) and poor LOS will be identified for the calibration. The assumption parameters for the uncalibrated model for all three periods is presented in following tables. Parameters that had influence on V/C ratio include the lane utilization factor, lost time adjustment and movement counts. The next section explains additional adjustments applied to the model.

Intersections with On-Street Parking

During the site visit, on-street parking on the north and south of the corridor was recorded. It should be noted that on-street parking can adversely affect the flow of the traffic in the following ways:    Capacity loss of the intersection Reduction of lane utilization factor Increase of delay that can be continued to the other links.

To consider the effect of the above problems in the Synchro model, a checkmark to the box for that approach was applied in the "Adjacent Parking Lane" category from the "Volume Settings". Also, the numbers of parking maneuvers were inserted by estimating the number of cars going in and out of parking stall per hour based on site visits. Figure 4 was utilized as an aid for Synchro parking maneuver coding.

Validation of the Calibrated Model

The travel time and delay data from the Travel Run Study were used to validate the calibrated Synchro models. It should be noted that the purpose of calibration is to reflect a known capacity condition, while the purpose of the validation is to verify that models would have similar travel times and delays along the corridor. The corridor travel time has two components for each segment: travel time (a function of the intersection spacing and the travel speed), and signal delay (the delay experienced due to a red light or queuing). From Synchro, the arterial level of service report can provide outputs for each segment along the corridor, separated into these two components: segment travel time, and signal delay. These will be compared with the observed data from surveys to determine the validity of the calibrated model. The calibrated Synchro output is compared with Travel Run Study result and summarized in Table 6.

Development of Alternative Timing Plans
Methodologies for Signal Optimization

Signal timing optimization is a process in which delay, the number of stops and travel time will be reduced to improve the traffic flow performances. The following steps were taken for optimization in this study: Define New Control Areas: The study area was divided into fewer control areas by determining the desirability of coordinating the intersections based on existing traffic operations for each peak period, current cycle length, minimum cycle length, through volumes on Wellington Street, road classification, intersection space distance, intersection control type and coordinatability provide by Synchro. The control areas for Yonge and University Streets were locked since they are part of the north-south coordination. The proposed control areas are shown in Table 7.

5.1.1

Optimization of Splits

For the split optimization, each control area was optimized separately according to its new proposed cycle length. In this optimization process, the objective function is to minimize the splits. Splits are optimized by percentile, with Synchro attempting to provide enough green time
18

to serve 90% of the flow from a lane group. All phases are assigned to a split greater or equal to their Minimum Split. If the minimum split is greater than the cycle length, then the optimization repeats the process and attempts 70th percentile and then 50th percentile. Parameters required for this optimization are volume, lanes, left turn type, fixed timing and cycle length. The constrains function is the cycle length, since Toronto District believes that not more than 80 second cycle length should be considered for downtown area. Within a control area, different split phasing may have been assigned for each of the intersections during the AM Peak, daytime OFF Peak and PM Peak. The following manual adjustments on splits were applied on the optimized model:   Ensured that the new timing of each advanced left turn phase would not be greater than 20 seconds; and Ensured that the new timing of each critical movement would not have an enormous change, especially for major-major intersections. 5.1.2 Optimization of Offsets

With the new cycle lengths and splits, each control area was optimized as a separate system in offset optimization, and per City's guidelines [8]. The objective in offset optimization is to minimize delay for each zone so it works well with its adjacent signals. Parameters required for offset optimization are distance between intersections, speed limit, volume, lanes, fixed timing and cycle length. City of Toronto limits the offset to be referenced to "beginning of green" and NEMA phases "2+6".

5.2

Review Left / Right Turn Movements

After the optimization of cycle lengths, splits, and offsets, the new MOEs were reviewed in Synchro. Among the three optimized models, the following left turn phases were proposed to be changed from permissive to protected / permissive operation in Table 8.

Evaluation of Proposed Signal Timings
Intersection and Movement Traffic Operations

The main measures of effectiveness ("MOE") are the travel time comparison between the calibrated existing conditions and the alternative conditions for AM, OFF and PM peak periods. Other MOE such as delay, the number of stops, capacity utilization (V/C ratio), average speed, fuel consumption, and emissions are also considered for the evaluation of the proposed alternatives. 6.1.1 Evaluation of AM Peak Period

Synchro optimized travel times are summarized in Table 9.

Overall, the proposed coordination plan reduces westbound travel times along the entire corridor by 68.0 (-26.4%) second. One corridor control area--between Yonge Street and York Street-- experienced a significant decrease in travel time. It should be noted that these intersections are closely spaced, and the decrease in travel time and coordinatability is very important. Also, another significant decrease in travel time could be observed on the stretch between Simcoe Street to Blue Jays Way Street, where the travel time in this control area has been improved by approximately 35 seconds.

The most notable decreased travel time is between Simcoe Street and Blue Jays Way Street. A similar improvement is observed for another segment of the corridor between Yonge Street to York Street, where the cycle length in this control area has been increased by 10 second. 6.1.3 Evaluation of OFF Peak Period Alternatives

Overall the proposed coordination plan reduces northbound and southbound travel times across the entire corridor by 9.4 (-3.8%). Some corridor segments experienced increases in travel time, the most notable of which is the westbound travel time between Simcoe Street and John Street. Otherwise, travel times for most control areas have been improved.

Time-Space Diagram

After implementation of the new timing plans, the offset developed from Synchro model should be verified with City's TransSuite TSD software. This software allows the user to create timespace diagrams for user-defined group signals. To generate a TSD using this software the signal spacing and posted speed limited should be inserted as an input. After creating the TSD it allows the user to monitor the start and end of the main street green times and green bands that would have been provided for all coordinated signals in a control area. Screenshots of the TSD are provided in Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7.

MOE and Operation Summary

All intersections and movements are evaluated using Synchro. The detailed MOEs per movement are recorded in Appendix F for the daytime OFF Peak, AM Peak, and PM Peak, respectively and the overall intersection MOE is summarized below.

Level of Service (LOS) Table 12 summarizes the changes to the intersection LOS after optimization (with those intersections that improved LOS highlighted in green). Overall, the signalized intersections maintain the LOS for all peak periods, except for Simcoe Street where the overall LOS after optimization has declined to C. For Simcoe Street, it should be noted that before signal optimization the signal plan was with respect to the northbound through movements only and no left turn signal existed. However, after installation of a new northbound left turn phase and removing the northbound through movement on Simcoe Street, the southbound movements, experienced a longer delay. It should be noted that the goal of coordination is to favour westbound movements over all other movements. Table 12 summarizes the overall intersection LOS.

Economic and Environmental Benefits

The economic and environmental impacts of the project are discussed in this section. The environmental and economic impacts of the signal timing improvements have also been measured to produce a summary of tangible improvements gained from this study. To analyze the economic impacts for the corridor, a cost-benefit analysis was undertaken [11]. The project costs and benefits were based on the following information:   Model Output Delay

Fuel Consumption Project Cost

The project environmental impacts were based on the following model outputs:   Carbon Monoxide produced Nitrogen Oxides produced

Economic Benefits

To determine whether traffic signal coordination was successful in terms of cost-effectiveness, a benefit and cost was analysis was performed. The benefits of the project were measured in terms of savings of the consumption of gas, the value of stops, and the economic value of delay. The assumptions and references for the benefit-cost ratio are summarized below:    The daily benefit should be based on 2hrs of AM/PM and 4hrs of OFF peak The annual benefits should be based on 250 weeks per year [4]. The savings in $ for travel time should be based on travel time value at US $15.86 per hour [4].  The savings in $ for number of stops should be based on the value of US at $0.014 per stop [4].  The savings in $ for fuel consumption should be based on Toronto's average fuel cost throughout the year at CAN per liter for 2015 [12].  The estimated City's cost to conduct signal coordination $2450 since the was conducted internally and includes costs such as Project information collection, Site investigations, traffic data counts, Synchro model reviews and uploading the new timing plans into the controller  The savings in $ for Carbon Monoxide should be based on the value of US at $7.011 per Kilogram [4].  The savings in $ for Nitrogen Oxide should be based on the value of US at $14.192 per Kilogram [4].

The currency conversion rate should be based on $1.27 from CAN$ to US$ Number of signals within the signal coordination study

Benefits for this study are estimated for a period of one year and converted to present value [10] for a life cycle of 3 years [11] and discount rate of 4% [13]. The benefit and cost ratio is perfumed using the following equation: R = Benefit-Cost Ratio, B = Total Value of the Benefits, C = Total Value of the Costs  =
 

The benefit, cost, and benefit-cost ratio are summarized in Table 15.

Conclusions and Recommendations

This study was completed to improve the coordination of traffic signals along Wellington Street West from Church Street to Blue Jays Way Street. The analysis methodologies, findings, and recommendations from the study are documented in this report. In summary, the project included 8 signalized intersections. The study included a review of the signal timings and coordination for AM, OFF and PM peak periods. The purpose of this project was to optimize signals through modification of signal timing plans while maintaining reasonably minimal impacts to the side street levels of service and delays. Inherently, the improvement of coordination yields reduced travel times, delays, a number of stops, and fuel consumption ­ producing a better driving experience for all motorists. The required field data for the analyses were collected at the beginning of the study, including turning movement counts (TMC), existing and historical timing plan, intersection drawings, and peak hour factor. The field visit was conducted to confirm the intersection and lane configuration or to observe any signal deficiencies. Travel run and delay study was conducted using GPS equipment and later transferred into the computer using PC-Travel software. The purpose of before period travel run and delay study was to assist with the calibration of the Synchro model before optimization. The model calibration process was educational and enforced the fundamental concepts and principle of traffic engineering. Therefore, the baseline Synchro models were developed and then calibrated for the AM, PM, and OFF peak periods for use in future analysis. The models were calibrated to the observed travel times throughout the corridor, and calibration was achieved by adjusting the Synchro parameters based on field observations. For each of the three time periods, calibration was achieved such that the modeled travel times were within 6% to 20% of the observed travel times over the entire corridor. The associated microsimulation software, Simtraffic and TransSuite also demonstrated the effectiveness when developing and visualizing offset and split solutions and the corresponding progression through `green band'.

31

The following factors had a negative impact on signal coordination and the smooth flow of traffic:      On Street Construction, Illegal On-Street Parking, Reduces lanes -available to through traffic from three to two lanes in some areas. Parking Regulations Volume exceeding the capacity

This project proved that with a good understanding of signal timing concept, the user could leverage the strength of signal timing model and engineering judgment. Finally, the benefits derived from this project proved that signal timing should not be compromised in the field and an effort like this to perform city-wide signal timing optimization is well worth the money. The benefits outweighed the cost of the entire project.

Recommendation
Trafficware's Synchro model is a well used and accepted traffic optimization and moddeling in North America, which has also the ability of calculation emission as seen in this report. Although Synchro is a traffic model but it only provides relatively crude traffic emission estimates. In recognition of the need for more detailed emissions analyses for project evaluation and other micro-scale applications, the EPA is currently in the testing stage of the second implementation of a comprehensive mobile emissions model, MOVES-HVI (Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator). The EPA reports that MOVES will incorporate second-by-second speed traces and vehicle specific power (which accounts for acceleration, speed, grade and road load) to allow project level dis-aggregate analysis of emissions. Both Synchro (the traffic model) and MOVES (the emissions model) are designed and function better with real assessments than detailed line assessments [14]. Assessing the emissions benefits of traffic signal coordination would be much better served by using MOVES C and MicroFac or similar model. With a MicroFac model one can address the specifics of the system, the fleet mix and the specifics of the arterial corridors being considered, to obtain reliable estimates of the probable fuel savings and emission reductions and be best assured that they are valid and reasonable [15].
32

While the Synchro model gives an indication of the energy and environmental benefits, MOVES would allow for a more detailed assessment, and the MicroFac model would allow for an even higher confidence in result and conclusion validity.
