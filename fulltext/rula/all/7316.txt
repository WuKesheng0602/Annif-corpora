Abstract: Titanium dioxide (TiO2 ) photocatalysis is one of the most commonly studied advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for the mineralization of deleterious and recalcitrant compounds present in wastewater as it is stable, inexpensive, and effective. Out of all, doping with metal and non-metals, and the heterojunction with another semiconductor were proven to be efficient methods in enhancing the degradation of organic pollutants under ultraviolet (UV) and visible light. However, complex degradation processes in the treatment of an actual wastewater are difficult to model and optimize. In the present study, the application of a modified photocatalyst, Ag/TiO2 /Fe2 O3 , for the degradation of an actual confectionery wastewater was investigated. Factorial studies and statistical design of experiments using the Box-Behnken method along with response surface methodology (RSM) were employed to identify the individual and cross-factor effects of independent parameters, including light wavelength (nm), photocatalyst concentration (g/L), initial pH, and initial total organic carbon (TOC) concentration (g/L). The maximum TOC removal at optimum conditions of light wavelength (254 nm), pH (4.68), photocatalyst dosage (480 mg/L), and initial TOC concentration (11,126.5 mg/L) was determined through the numerical optimization method (9.78%) and validated with experimental data (9.42%). Finally, the first-order rate constant with respect to TOC was found to be 0.0005 min-1 with a residual value of 0.998.

1. Introduction Confectionery wastewater effluents contain high amounts of sugar (sucrose), sugar alcohol, artificial sweeteners (aspartame, acesulfame, and sucralose), food additives, colorants (TiO2 ), natural flavors, and artificial flavors that account for their high strength in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD) [1,2]. These organic compounds can cause sudden shocks and rapid dissolved oxygen depletion in the biological treatment systems when discharged to surrounding municipal wastewater treatment facilities, further causing deviation in characteristics of treated effluents [1­3]. Among all, artificial sweeteners, such as aspartame, acesulfame, and sucralose, are extremely stable throughout the conventional wastewater treatment processes; however, toxicity will increase after photodegradation [4­6]. As the inadequately treated wastewater containing deleterious substances is being discharged to large water bodies, they will continue to persist with half-lives up to several years [6,7].

Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are promising and environmentally friendly wastewater treatment technologies capable of mineralizing deleterious substances in wastewater systems [4,8­10]. Among all, photocatalysis, especially with titanium dioxide (TiO2 ), is commonly studied owing to its high chemical stability, promising efficiency, low cost, and non-toxicity [10­12]. The study conducted by Sang et al. showed promising efficiency of TiO2 in degrading the artificial sweeteners found in confectionery wastewater and in mineralizing the intermediate products generated during the degradation process [4]. Photomineralization is a process in which the photogenerated hydroxyl radical participates in the redox reactions with the organic materials in aqueous solutions which produce intermediate products (aldehydes and carboxylic acids) and, finally, achieve complete oxidation of carbon atoms [1,4,9,10,13]. However, the application of TiO2 is limited by the ultraviolet (UV) activation and the fast recombination rate of the generated electron-hole pairs [10,12,14]. Hence, modifications of TiO2 photocatalysts through metal doping, non-metal doping, and its combination with another semiconductor photocatalyst are common methods to extend the absorption wavelength of TiO2 towards visible light spectrum, to restrict the recombination of electron-hole pairs, and to increase the specific surface area of the photocatalyst [9­17]. Metal doping of TiO2 can be accomplished through interstitial doping and substitutional doping. Interstitial doping involves metal dopants located on the surface of TiO2 , and substitutional doping involves the substitution of Ti4+ atoms by metal dopants [9,18,19]. Metal doping also introduces a mid-gap energy level in the band gap of TiO2 [20,21]. Out of all metal dopants, noble metals have higher resistance to corrosion, making them ideal to be used in water treatment processes. Metal dopants include Au, Ag, Co, Fe, Ni, Pt, and Zn [9,10]. Non-metal doping is established through similar theories, except that in substitutional doping O2- atoms are substituted by a non-metal dopant, and non-metal doping of TiO2 also has a promising effect in expanding the photocatalytic activity to the visible light region of the spectrum [10,22]. Common non-metal dopants include B, C, F, I, N, and S [13]. These metal and non-metal dopants are effective in introducing a mid-gap energy state in the TiO2 energy levels and enhance the specific surface area of the photocatalyst [13,23]. Moreover, combining two semiconductor photocatalysts, such as Zn/TiO2 , CdS/TiO2 /Pt, TiO2 /Y-zeolite, Ag2 O/TiO2 , Ag-Bi2 MoO4 , zeolite/WO3 -Pt, and CdS-SnO2 , has also been studied to enhance the photoactivity of photocatalysts [24,25]. Each modification method has its own strengths and shortcomings. Other physical parameters, such as specific surface area, crystalline phase, crystalline size, and pore distribution, that can be modified through these modification methods are crucial in improving the photocatalytic activity of a photocatalyst [10,13,17,26]. Among all, metal-doped and semi-conductor-combined photocatalyst, Ag/TiO2 /Fe2 O3 , presents an excellent improvement in the photoactivity under ultraviolet type-A (UV-A) in the treatment of textile dyes [26]. In the present study, a TiO2 photocatalyst was synthesized, combined with another semiconductor (Fe2 O3 ), and finally doped with a noble metal (Ag) using the UV-assisted thermal method established by Nasirian [26]. The optimization of the degradation of organic pollutants in an actual confectionery wastewater was performed using single-variable studies [4,27­31]. However, it is difficult to predict the optimum reaction conditions from previous results owing to the possible interactions between different independent variables involved in the photocatalytic reactions [10,17,22,30]. Statistical programs come in handy to help establish a design of experiment (DOE) using response surface methodology (RSM) to develop a mathematical function relating the response with various predictors, and to obtain optimum conditions that maximizes the desired results under high desirability [8,32]. Furthermore, the central composited design (CCD) and Box-Behnken design (BBD) are both effective RSM designs to generate a second-order response surface model in the optimization of the photocatalytic treatment process [8,10,17,22,32]. The BBD is preferred when parameters are limited to three levels [8,10,22]. In this study, the as-synthesized modified photocatalyst, Ag/TiO2 /Fe2 O3 , was employed to treat an actual confectionery wastewater (CWW), and the photomineralization process was optimized by numerical and graphical optimization methods of Box-Behnken Design (BBD) with response surface

Figure 2c illustrates the X-ray diffractogram of the Ag/TiO2 /Fe2 O3 (0.005 Ag:TiO2 w:w and 0.01 Fe:TiO2 w:w); the crystalline phases were confirmed with the standard diffractograms in the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS-21-1272) databank. Primary anatase and rutile TiO2 phases were observed with 2 peaks at 25.3 and 27.4 , respectively. In contrast to the work performed by Nasirian [26] where only anatase phase was observed in Ag/TiO2 /Fe2 O3 , rutile phase was also observed in all prepared TiO2 after calcination at 300  C. Other peaks of anatase TiO2 were located at 38.2 , 48.0 , and 54.3 . Other peaks of rutile TiO2 were located at 36.0 , 41.2 , 44.1 , and 56.6 . The generation of rutile phase under transition temperature was caused by the high titanium precursor concentration positively affecting the rutile content [33,34]. Moreover, a small 2 peak representing Fe2 O3 at 39.28 indicated a low concentration of Fe2 O3 phase presented in the Ag/TiO2 /Fe2 O3 photocatalyst. The specific surface area of the conventional TiO2 , as-prepared TiO2 , TiO2 /Fe2 O3 , Ag/TiO2 , and Ag/TiO2 /Fe2 O3 is illustrated in Figure 1 with the greatest being 178.48 m2 /g for Ag/TiO2 /Fe2 O3 and lowest being 2.32 m2 /g for rutile TiO2 . Specific surface area of other photocatalyst were 42.27 m2 /g for anatase TiO2 , 39.80 m2 /g for P25 TiO2 , 28.36 m2 /g for as-prepared TiO2 , 98.69 m2 /g for TiO2 /Fe2 O3 , and 63.20 m2 /g for Ag/TiO2 . The incorporation of Fe2 O3 into TiO2 crystalline structure forms TiO2 -Fe2 O3 heterojunction, increasing the specific surface area of the photocatalyst. Moreover, the surface doping of Ag onto TiO2 modified the surface structure of the photocatalyst, decreasing the anatase grain size and increasing the specific surface area of the photocatalyst at relatively low concentrations of Ag/TiO2 [35]. However, excess silver would cover up the surface of the photocatalyst leading to the reduction in the concentration of photogenerated charge carrier and hinder the contact between TiO2 and organic pollutants [9,26,35]. As photocatalytic reactions take place on the surface of the photocatalyst, the photocatalysts tend to have higher activity when higher specific surface area presents owing to the higher number of active sites available for reactions. At the same time, visible light activity is limited in the bare TiO2 , while the modification of TiO2 with a metal and a semi-conductor element greatly increases its activity in the visible region along with its specific surface area. 2.3. Effects of Individual Factors Several factors affect the photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of aqueous organics during the photocatalytic process. Among those, pH, photocatalyst dosage, initial TOC concentration, and irradiation wavelength are the greatest contributors to the process. Figure 3a shows that the Ag/TiO2 /Fe2 O3 photocatalyst has higher activity under UV-C irradiation as compared to that of visible light illumination. This effect is generally contributed by the higher photon energy provided by UV-C as compared to that of UV-A and visible light. Figure 3b depicts the optimum pH of the photocatalytic reactions at 4.41, which further indicated that pH adjustment was not required before photocatalytic reactions. Results in Figure 3c illustrate the optimum photocatalyst dosage of 500 mg/L. The photocatalyst dosing above such concentration would increase the turbidity of the slurry causing photocatalytic efficiency to reduce due to lower light transmission. In addition, a reduction in treatment efficiency was experienced when the photocatalyst dosage was lower than such concentration, which potentially led to lower amount of hydroxyl radical formation. Figure 3d shows the inverse proportionality between TOC removal rates and initial TOC concentrations under constant photocatalyst dosage, which is mainly due to the abundancy of organic molecules as compared to that of the short-lived hydroxyl radicals formed during photocatalysis.

The statistical significance of the developed model and predictors was evaluated using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of the TOC removal, as shown in Table 2. The significance of each factor coefficient was determined using probability values (p-values) from Fisher's (F) exact test, where p < 0.05 indicated a significant model or predictor while p > 0.05 indicated non-significance. In this study, the predictor terms X2 X3 , X3 X4 , and X1 2 were not significant in the response, which indicated that changes in these variables would not significantly affect the overall TOC removal based on this model. The determination coefficient (R2 ) of 0.9918 and the adjusted R2 of 0.9837 ensured a high significance of the developed model, as R2 and adjusted R2 close to 1.0 were desired [8,10,17]. The insignificant lack of fit (p > 0.05), suggested that the developed statistical model fitted well with the observed data [8,10,17].

Interaction between Model Parameters, 2D Contour Plots, and 3D Response Surface As shown in Table 2, among all model parameters, the interaction between the pH and the photocatalyst dosage (X2 X3 ), the photocatalyst dosage, and the initial TOC concentration (X3 X4 ) did not have significant effects on the TOC removal. In contrast, the interaction between light wavelength and all other three parameters (X1 X2 , X1 X3 , and X1 X4 ) and the interaction between the pH and the initial TOC concentration (X2 X4 ) presented significant effects. Thus, the choice of the light wavelength,

The three-dimensional (3D) surfaces and two-dimensional (2D) contour plots in Figure 5 showed the cross-factor interaction effects between independent predictors for the removal of TOC in photocatalytic treatment of CWW. The response functions of the variation and interaction between two predictor parameters were presented while keeping other parameters fixed at center levels [8,10,17]. Figure 5a­c shows the inverse relationship between the TOC removal and the light wavelength. The interaction between light wavelength and other factors were shown to intensify when the light wavelength was minimized, recommending for the application of UV-C photocatalytic treatment.

2.6. Optimization of Process Parameters The RSM was used to maximize the TOC removal (Y) under optimized experimental conditions of the four predictor parameters, including the light wavelength (X1 ), the pH (X2 ), the photocatalyst dosage (X3 ), and the initial TOC concentration (X4 ). The optimization of these parameters was accomplished using numerical optimization method of BBD built into the statistical software, Design Expert 10.0.3.1, using Equation (1) as the objective function for TOC removal while independent variables were used as constraints in the defined critical ranges. The multiple-response function shown in Equation (1) was used to obtain the interaction plots in Figure 6 while maximizing the TOC removal (Y ) and desirability value (D). The desirability value was determined by the statistical software based on Equation (6). Hence, the desirability value of 1.00 was achieved while acquiring a TOC removal of 9.78% under optimum conditions of the light wavelength (254 nm; UV-C), the pH (4.68), the photocatalyst dosage (480 mg/L), and the initial TOC concentration (11,126.5 mg/L) for the photocatalytic treatment of CWW using Ag/TiO2 /Fe2 O3 . Finally, the obtained optimum experimental conditions were validated by an extra experiment, which presented 9.42% TOC removal. The observed, experimental TOC removal under optimum conditions was within 95% CI and 5% relative standard deviation (RSD) of the predicted value, confirming the accuracy and reliability of the developed model. The first-order rate constant of the photocatalytic treatment based on the TOC for the CWW under optimum conditions of the light wavelength of 254 nm, the pH of 4.68, the photocatalyst dosage of 480.0 mg/L, and the initial TOC concentration of 11,126.5 mg/L was determined from Figure 7. The relationship between natural-log of the ratio between TOC concentrations and the time of the photocatalytic treatment process was modeled by a linear function based on Equation (4). As listed in Table 3, the first-order rate constant and the coefficient of determination (R2 ) (0.0005 min-1 and 0.998 for Ag/TiO2 /Fe2 O3 ; and 0.0004 min-1 and 0.995 for commercial P25 TiO2 photocatalyst, respectively) presented an improvement in photocatalytic efficiency in the modified photocatalyst as compared to that of commercial photocatalyst under optimized experimental conditions. In addition, an excellent linearity of photocatalytic treatment process representing high fitness of the rate model was obtained.

Statistical Model A four-factor BBD with RSM was used to maximize the TOC removal in photocatalytic mineralization of organic compounds in an actual confectionery wastewater. Light wavelength (X1 ), pH (X2 ), photocatalyst dosage (X3 ), and initial TOC concentration (TOC0 ) (X4 ) were considered as independent predictor parameters while the TOC removal (Y) was considered as the process response in the Design of Experiment (DOE). Design Expert 10.0.3.1 statistical software (Stat-Ease, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was utilized to optimize the reaction conditions through numerical and graphical methods. The quadratic model (Equation (5)) estimated the parametric coefficients of the statistical model by correlating both predictor parameters and responses using the least-squares regression [8,10,17]: Yi =  o +   i Xi +   ii Xi2 +

In this equation, o , i , ii , and ij are the constant, linear, quadratic, and cross-factor interaction coefficients, respectively; Xi and Xj are the coded predictor parameters listed in Table 4; Yi is the response under evaluation; k is the number of predictors of the model; and c is the residual error [8,10]. The significance of the model equation, individual parameters, and the interactions between factors were evaluated through ANOVA with the CI of 95% ( = 0.05). The p-value larger than 0.05 was considered insignificant, whilst the p-value smaller than 0.05 was considered significant. From the experimental data along with the quadratic models, 2D contour plots and 3D surface responses were constructed. Optimized operating conditions along of the quadratic model with its response at maximum TOC removal was developed through numerical and graphical optimization methods and they were validated with additional experimental runs.

Note: The maximum initial TOC concentration was obtained from the collected raw wastewater samples. Other initial TOC concentrations were prepared via dilution of wastewater sample with distilled water. The three levels of light wavelength (X1 ) refer to different types of light sources with similar photometric intensities that were utilized in this experimental design.

The desirability multiple-response approach was utilized to obtain a concurrent objective function in Equation (5) through a combination of desired ranges for each response as shown in Equation (6) [8,10]: D = (Y1 × Y2 × . . . × dn )

In this equation, D, Y, and n are the desirability term, response (percent TOC removal), and the total number of process responses, respectively. During simultaneous optimization of the photocatalytic reactions, the response function is required to stay within the desired range; otherwise, the desirability becomes zero. 4. Conclusions In general, the statistical model developed through RSM combined with a four-factor BBD was found to be reliable for modeling the photocatalytic treatment of CWW using Ag/TiO2 /Fe2 O3 . The accuracy of the developed statistical model was evaluated using ANOVA, demonstrating that the light wavelength, the pH, the photocatalyst dosage, and the initial TOC concentration were significant, independent predictors of the TOC removal. The cross-factor effects between these parameters were also evaluated. The numerical optimization achieved a maximum TOC removal of 9.78% at the light wavelength of 254 nm, the pH of 4.68, the photocatalyst dosage of 480 mg/L, and the initial TOC concentration of 11,126.5 mg/L; while the desirability was maintained at 1.0 within the 95% CI. The experimental validation of numerically optimized condition presented 9.42% TOC removal within 5% relative standard deviation of the predicted value. The optimized condition indicated that no adjustment of pH for the treatment of the actual CWW was required. Therefore, the proposed statistical model successfully described the photo-mineralization of complex pollutant matrix present in the actual CWW under UV-C, and the first-order rate constant could be utilized as a future reference on photoreactor design, process optimization, and scale-up studies. Meanwhile, there is a need in designing a continuous model and simulation of the model along with statistical modeling. However, slurry photocatalysis in a continuous form is difficult to apply at the industrial scale, so there is a need to investigate the immobilization of the modified photocatalyst with reusability studies. Finally, the effect of photocatalytic treatment on improving the biodegradability of an actual CWW could be further studied to help in the design of a photocatalytic treatment system for the pre-treatment of CWW prior to biological treatment.
