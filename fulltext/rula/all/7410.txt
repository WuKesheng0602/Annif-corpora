Abstract: In this study, a TiO2 catalyst, modified with tungsten oxide (WO3 ), was synthesized to reduce its bandgap energy (Eg ) and to improve its photocatalytic performance. For the catalyst evaluation, the effect of the calcination temperature on the solar photocatalytic degradation was analyzed. The experimental runs were carried out in a CPC (compound parabolic collector) pilot-scale solar reactor, following a multilevel factorial experimental design, which allowed analysis of the effect of the calcination temperature, the initial concentration of amoxicillin, and the catalyst load on the amoxicillin removal. The most favorable calcination temperature for the catalyst performance, concerning the removal of amoxicillin, was 700  C; because it was the only sample that showed the rutile phase in its crystalline structure. Regarding the loss of the antibiotic activity, the inhibition tests showed that the treated solution of amoxicillin exhibited lower antibacterial activity. The highest amoxicillin removal achieved in these experiments was 64.4% with 100 ppm of amoxicillin concentration, 700  C of calcination temperature, and 0.1 g L-1 of catalyst load. Nonetheless, the modified TiO2 /WO3 underperformed compared to the commercial TiO2 P25, due to its low specific surface and the particles sintering during the sol-gel synthesis.

1. Introduction Heterogeneous photocatalysis, based on TiO2 , has been widely used for environmental applications such as removal of contaminants and water disinfection due to its oxidative reactions [1­3]. However, TiO2 shows a significant limitation when solar radiation is used for promoting the formation of oxidant species including hydroxyl radicals (·OH) because TiO2 uses only a small fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum corresponding to the UV (Ultraviolet) radiation (wavelengths shorter than 400 nm) [4,5]. To improve the usage of the solar spectrum, several alternatives have been proposed, including catalyst doping, dye-sensitization, and modification with other oxides [6,7]. Ramos-Delgado et al. [8,9] observed the highest photocatalytic activity of TiO2 /WO3 materials while using 1% w/w of WO3 . Thus, the selection of WO3 as modifying oxide is encouraged by the

reduction of the bandgap energy (Eg = 2.8 eV), which has also been reported for TiO2 in a previous work [10]. The reduction of the Eg improves the radiation usage by the photocatalyst since WO3 can act as an electron-accepting species and reduces the recombination rate of the electron-hole pairs. Regarding the photocatalytic mechanism, the semiconductor TiO2 is responsible for the electron exchange in the redox reactions and WO3 can act as a defect of the crystalline structure, inserting an energetic localized state [8,9]. For assessing the photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 /WO3 material, the oxidation of a commercial antibiotic (amoxicillin) was studied in the presence of solar radiation. Amoxicillin is one of the most consumed antibiotics worldwide and concentrations in the range of 3­87 µg L-1 have been reported for hospital effluents [11]. In general, antibiotics have been classified as emergent pollutants due to the potential risks involved with their presence in water bodies and the recent interest in looking for treatment alternatives for their removal. The highest environmental risk of these drugs is the development of waterborne pathogens resistant to the antibiotic activity. Therefore, their natural resistance to biological wastewater treatments has directed the research to novel and more effective technologies for removing these pollutants [12]. Amoxicillin is recognized to be highly refractory and persistent in aquatic ecosystems. Due to the non-selective nature of ·OH, several emergent contaminants, including amoxicillin, can be entirely oxidized by advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) as previously reported [13­15]. Photo-Fenton has been reported as an alternative for amoxicillin removal, achieving 52% of total organic carbon (TOC) reduction [16]. Regarding heterogeneous photocatalysis, few applications with TiO2 /WO3 as a catalyst have been reported. Ramos-Delgado et al. [8] synthesized TiO2 modified with WO3 for degrading Malathion, an organophosphorus pesticide. The TOC removal in this work was 78%, comparable with the 47% removal obtained with bare TiO2 . It is important to note that for TiO2 /WO3 , there are no reports of antibiotics removal. However, there are previous studies of TiO2 doped with Fe and C where 78% of amoxicillin removal was achieved [12,17], evidencing the satisfactory performance of the photocatalysis for eliminating amoxicillin. This work assessed the photocatalytic activity, not only based on the amoxicillin degradation or the TOC removal but also estimating the loss of the antibacterial activity. It has been found that despite achieving a complete degradation of amoxicillin, even with high TOC removals, the presence of the remaining intermediates can show some antibacterial activity [18]. Regarding bacterial inactivation, this can be more harmful than the presence of the parent antibiotic since waterborne bacteria may develop a more effective resistance to antibiotic activity. Nevertheless, there is no information about the survival or regrowth rates for specific bacteria in such conditions. Regarding the use of solar radiation as photon source, this is precisely one of the advantages of the reduction of the Eg for the TiO2 /WO3 -based photocatalysis [9,19,20]. It is expected to observe a better performance of the modified TiO2 in comparison with bare TiO2 due to a broader absorption of the radiation spectrum of the modified photocatalyst, as mentioned earlier. The experiments of this research were carried out in a pilot-scale CPC photoreactor [21] under the tropical weather conditions of Cali, Colombia, to evaluate the activity of the modified TiO2 with solar radiation for removing commercial amoxicillin. Moreover, the kinetics was studied by fitting the parameters of a modified Langmuir-Hinshelwood expression with experimental data gathered from the solar photocatalytic tests. The accumulated UV energy was chosen as the independent variable instead of time in this kinetic analysis, because of the variation of the solar irradiation during the experimental runs. This approach allows a consideration of a more accurate manner of a potential scale-up of the photoreactor since the photocatalytic reaction rate depends on the photon absorption as it has been reported in previous studies [22,23].

The difference between the bandgap energies obtained at higher calcination temperatures can be attributed to the characteristic retention of the OH groups by the solids prepared by the sol-gel method [8]. Because of the Eg reduction, compared to bare TiO2 , TiO2 /WO3 can absorb radiation under 465 nm of wavelength, which means that the material can use part of the visible spectrum of light, as reported in previous works [9,19,20,23,31,32]. Figure 3 shows the XRD patterns obtained with the three different calcination temperatures. There is only one crystalline phase at 500 and 600  C corresponding to the anatase (tetragonal) structure [8]; whereas, at 700  C two phases appear, corresponding to a mixture of anatase (JCPDS 98-009-6394) and rutile (JCPDS 98-004-1028) structures [33]. This result is consistent with those shown in Figure 1, where the DRS obtained at 700  C showed a lower reflectance than the one obtained at 600  C. This outcome is congruent with the reported literature [8­10] since the rutile phase has a lower Eg than the anatase phase, as mentioned previously. Regarding WO3 , its presence could not be detected by XRD because of its low content in the photocatalyst [10]. The values of the crystal diameter (perpendicular and parallel) and the proportions of the phases were obtained by processing the data with the X'Pert (Malvern Panalytical, Malvern, United Kingdom), GSAS (Edgewall Software, Pittsburgh, PN, USA), and EXPGUI (Edgewall Software, Pittsburgh, PN, USA) software packages, as seen in Table 2.

It is important to note that the sample calcined at 700  C exhibited an anatase/rutile ratio: 74/26; nonetheless, the average crystal diameters are much larger than the obtained ones at 500 and 600  C. The large crystal sizes are the product of the clustering of the WO3 on the TiO2 surface as reported in similar studies [8,9]. Although the presence of these clusters can be beneficial for the photocatalytic activity since they can avoid the hole-electron recombination, a larger crystal may affect the performance of the material in photocatalytic reactions negatively, because of the significant decrease of the surface area. The results in Table 3 are the logical consequence of the behavior observed in Table 2. As the crystal size increases, the surface area decreases as expected. The significant reduction of the surface area for the sample calcined at 700  C may be related to the formation of WO3 clusters mentioned previously.

Regarding the pore diameter, the results for the catalysts calcined at the different temperatures show similar diameters for the samples obtained at 500 and 600  C (~77 nm); however, a much larger diameter (122.40 nm) was exhibited for the 700  C sample. This last result represents a potential positive effect for the photocatalytic reaction because the mass transport through the catalyst pore will be easier than in smaller pores. The decrease of the surface area, with the subsequent increase of the pore size, can be explained due to the material sintering during the calcination at higher temperatures.

2.2.1. Effect of the Calcination Temperature 2.2.1. Effect of the Calcination Temperature The most relevant fact that can favor the degradation of amoxicillin is that with a calcination The most relevant fact that can favor the degradation of amoxicillin is that with a calcination temperature above 650 °C the rutile phase appears, and the photocatalytic activity of the synthesized temperature above 650  C the rutile phase appears, and the photocatalytic activity of the synthesized material increases. This fact was evidenced on the XRD of Figure 3, which shows a small peak next material increases.

As discussed before, the ratio of anatase/rutile of the sample calcined at 700 °C was found to be 74/26, which is very similar to that reported for the commercial TiO2 Aeroxide P25 (Evonik, Essen, Germany) [28]. Although the surface area of this sample was the lowest of the three materials tested (due to the TiO2 sintering at higher temperatures), the larger pore diameter seems to compensate this significant drawback of the catalyst.

As discussed before, the ratio of anatase/rutile of the sample calcined at 700  C was found to be 74/26, which is very similar to that reported for the commercial TiO2 Aeroxide P25 (Evonik, Essen, Germany) [28]. Although the surface area of this sample was the lowest of the three materials tested (due to the TiO2 sintering at higher temperatures), the larger pore diameter seems to compensate this significant drawback of the catalyst. The sample calcined at 600  C showed quite good performance as well, which suggests that there must be an optimum of calcination temperature between 600 and 700  C. Further experiments should be carried out to synthesize a material not only with adequate surface area and particle size but also with a good photoactivity due to the rutile phase presence. Regarding the Eg , the sample calcined at 700  C showed the lowest value and its photocatalytic performance was the best of the three samples tested. This result is congruent with the main objective of the TiO2 modification, which is to reduce the bandgap energy and to improve the photocatalytic activity. 2.2.2. Effect of the Initial Amoxicillin Concentration The higher initial concentrations of the substrate in any photocatalytic reaction negatively affect the catalyst performance, as has been reported in several works [16,22,28]. In this study, the same behavior was observed as well. The higher concentrations of amoxicillin are detrimental to the photocatalytic degradation because of the reduction of the available active sites of the catalyst after the adsorption of the amoxicillin and other compounds to the TiO2 /WO3 surface. In the case of higher concentrations, the adsorbed molecules can inhibit the ·OH radicals' generation and the degradation rate decreases as a logical consequence. 2.2.3. Effect of the Catalyst Load The catalyst load can have a positive effect on the photocatalytic degradation; that means that the performance will increase with an increase of the catalyst load as can be observed from the results shown in Table 4. Nonetheless, the presence of a maximum has been reported in previous studies [22,38­40], which is around 0.35 g L-1 for a CPC reactor of the same characteristics used for this research but with TiO2 P25 as the catalyst. The existence of this maximum is because of the "clouding" effect in the reactor when higher catalyst loads are used in photocatalytic reactions. This phenomenon occurs when an excessive number of particles suspended in the reactor does not allow the photon to pass through the bulk liquid, and therefore, it avoids the generation of the electron-hole pairs necessary for the ·OH formation. The highest catalyst load used in these experiments (0.10 g L-1 ) is still lower than the maximum mentioned above; consequently, it is expected that better degradations are achieved with this value. From Table 4, it can be observed that only the samples calcined at 700  C show this behavior. As mentioned above, the sample of 700  C exhibited the largest crystal size and accordingly, the largest cluster size. With these characteristics, they exhibit less scattering and photon absorption due to their larger size and thus, higher catalyst loads are required to generate the same amount of ·OH radicals than the solids with smaller sizes (samples calcined at 500 and 600  C) [38­40]. Although the effect of the pH was not considered in this study since the experiments were carried out at the natural pH of the solution (6.8­7.0), it is reported that the particle size is affected by the pH [5]. When the solution pH is close to the zero-charge point (pHzpc ) of the solid, this tends to form large clusters with the consequences mentioned above. For the commercial TiO2 , the reported pHzpc is around 6.5 [41]; therefore, it is probable that the value for the synthesized material in this study is similar and large clusters are formed.

Results shown in Table 5 can be related to the difference between the specific surface area of the catalysts. Where the TiO2/WO3 showed a higher value of the adsorption constant than the P25, the latter exhibited a higher apparent kinetic constant. The global reaction rate is limited by the kinetic for the case of the TiO2/WO3 catalyst because of the surface can be covered easily by the substrates (that means a zero-order rate law). Whereas, for the P25, the behavior of the degradation kinetics fits a pseudo-first order law trend, where the adsorption can limit the rate or the kinetics indistinctly [41].

It has been reported that the photocatalytic degradation of several pharmaceuticals can lead to byproducts [11,13,16,17]. Concerning antibiotics, the disappearance of the parent compound more toxic toxic byproducts [11,13,16,17]. Concerning antibiotics, the disappearance of the parent does not guarantee that the byproducts do not present antibacterial activity, despite the non-selective compound does not guarantee that the byproducts do not present antibacterial activity, despite the nature of the photocatalytic oxidation. non-selective nature of the photocatalytic oxidation. In Figure 7, the inhibition halo for the sample after photocatalytic treatment (3) is smaller than that observed for the sample before the treatment (1). From this observation, it can be proposed that photocatalytic degradation degradation yielded yielded a lower number of antibiotic byproducts. This This outcome outcome is the photocatalytic congruent with previous works that used TiO2 -assisted photocatalysis for removing amoxicillin and antibiotics [11­13,16,17]. This This result result can can be be used used in in future future works works that that study study the coupling of other antibiotics heterogeneous solar photocatalysis to a biological system to polish the wastewater treatment. treatment.

3.4. Kinetic Analysis The Langmuir-Hinshelwood expression was modified to consider the change of the amoxicillin concentrations with respect to the accumulated UVA radiation, as follows: kapp KAds C dC = dQUV 1 + KAds C (3)

where C is the amoxicillin concentration in ppm, KAds is the adsorption constant in ppm-1 , QUV is the accumulated UVA radiation in J m-2 and kapp is the apparent kinetic constant in ppm·m2 J-1 . For estimating the model parameters, Equation (3) is transformed into its linear form for fitting its parameters from the experimental data by using linear regression: dQUV 1 1 1 = · + dC kapp KAds C kapp (4)

The reciprocal of the term dC/dQUV , which is analog to dC/dt, was plotted versus the reciprocal of the concentration (1/C). By using the minimum squares analysis, the model parameters, KAds and kapp , were estimated from the slope and the y-intercept of the curve fitted to the experimental results. 3.5. Determination of Inhibition Halo An antibiogram was performed for determining the potential loss of antibiotic power of the amoxicillin [43]. The reactants used for this test were: eosin Methylene Blue agar (Lot. VM290047 124, Merck, Cali, Colombia), nutrient agar (Lot. 16761, Bogota, Colombia), BactoTM Peptone (Lot. 3063372, Becton Dickinson, Bogota, Colombia) and E. Coli. (WG5) as the model bacterium. The tests were carried out in Petri's boxes of 9 cm and an incubator (WTB Binder, Tuttlingen, Germany) with a McFarland 0.5 standard for determining the concentration of colonies forming units (CFU) of present bacteria. 4. Conclusions The calcination temperature had a significant effect on the photocatalytic performance for removing amoxicillin. The material synthesized at 700  C was the only one that exhibited the presence of the rutile crystalline phase in its structure. Nonetheless, it underperformed compared with the commercial standard, Aeroxide P25, which could remove all the amoxicillin with less UVA accumulated radiation than the required one by the TiO2 /WO3 catalyst. Regarding the loss of antibacterial activity, the inhibition test showed that TiO2 /WO3 -assisted photocatalytic degradation yields oxidation byproducts with less antibiotic activity than the original amoxicillin.
