ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We thank Jon Johnson and Serena Johnson from First Story Toronto for their guidance, suggestions, and information about areas around Ryerson. Their First Story Toronto app was extremely helpful in further developing our resource list. We also thank Hayden King, advisor to the Dean on Indigenous Education in the Faculty of Arts and Executive Director of the Yellowhead Institute, for his support and guidance through the development of this resource guide, and Reena Tandon, Faculty of Arts, for her suggestions and ideas. A special thank you to Harald Bauder, Director of the Graduate Program in Immigration and Settlement Studies, for being our advisor and guiding us through the development process of this fieldtrip guide. Sharyne Williams helped formatting this document. Funding was provided by the Graduate Program in Immigration and Settlement Studies and the Faculty of Arts at Ryerson University.

HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE
This resource guide contributes to a knowledge base of events, facts, interpretations, and relationships relating to Indigenous peoples with a particular focus on the land that is currently occupied by Ryerson University. This knowledge base is available for free to anyone who wishes to learn about or educate others about this topic. We realize that nobody "owns" this knowledge but that knowledge is always embodied and situated in personal experiences. Please use and share this knowledge responsibly and with respect. The guide is intended to facilitate walking fieldtrips involving particular sites (i.e. "stations") located on or close to Ryerson campus. For each station, we identified several resources and included links to original sources. We structured this guide by listing the sources followed by a brief description of the information from the source in bullet form. This brief description does not replace reading the original source but is rather intended to help the reader navigate the guide. We envision several ways in which this guide can be used: it can be used as a selfguided tour; it can be used by the community organizations and Ryerson instructors to develop fieldtrips to be delivered to their classes or other audiences; or it can be used by students and the wider community to learn about Indigenous peoples and their relationship to Ryerson University.

"Toronto is in the 'Dish W ith One Spoon Territory'. The Dish With One Spoon is a treaty between the Anishinaabe, Mississaugas and Haudenosaunee that bound them to share the territory and protect the land. Subsequent Indigenous Nations and peoples, Europeans and all newcomers have been invited into this treaty in the spirit of peace, friendship and respect." This website explains Ryerson's land acknowledgement and when and why it was made Has a link to the PDF file of the Ryerson Land Acknowledgement Statement which has a bit more detail

The words dish with one spoon and other similar terms have been used since time immemorial by Aboriginal people in the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence valley region and some nations believe that this is the first constitution between nations before colonization The `Dish With One Spoon' treaty were agreements concerning the shared hunting grounds The treaty was enshrined in the Royal Proclamation of 1764 and announced many times afterward The dish symbolizes a common hunting ground, while the spoon denotes that people are free to hunt within it and to eat the game and fish together Agreements between Indigenous nations to share hunting grounds predate written records, but their antiquity is memorialized in rich oral traditions that were erased during the "Indian Residential School' era

Wampum belts were used to identify the significance of these agreements between Nations to share the territory for hunting or agriculture passed on by knowledge keepers from generation to generation Occasionally, these agreements were formalized in treaties, and after the arrival of Europeans in North America the words were translated and recorded by French, Dutch and English

These are recommended land acknowledgements that have been developed by local university-based Indigenous councils or advisory groups The goal is to encourage all academic staff association representatives and members to acknowledge the First Peoples on whose traditional territories we live and work Acknowledging territory shows recognition of and respect for Aboriginal Peoples. It is recognition of their presence both in the past and the present Recognition and respect are essential elements of establishing healthy, reciprocal relations These relationships are key to reconciliation, a process to which CAUT is committed

General knowledge about land acknowledge across Canada

The Medicine Wheel
We take no ownership over this information and knowledge that was respectfully gained in a good way through knowledge sharing and learning by attending cultural camps and teachings in the Indigenous community. Indigenous people have been practicing their own belief systems, that connected them to all aspects of each person's daily activities, for thousands of years. These belief systems honoured and respected the connection to the land, the universe, and one another--experiences that were individual and transformative. Traditional knowledge and sustenance gained by observing the natural world of plant and animal life. This knowledge, as it continues to develop, advance, and adapt over time, is passed down from generation to generation through traditional oral teachings The Medicine Wheel also known as the Sacred Circle or Hoop, has been used by generations of various First Nations peoples for health and healing. First Nations consider the Medicine Wheel as the holistic approach of an individual's overall health 5

and well-being. It embodies the Four Directions or Quadrants that represent the spirit, physical, mental, and emotional aspect of one's health. When one of these aspects lack or is out of balance, there are significant consequences in a person's overall socia l and physical well-being. The four directions or quadrants are:  The North represents the Spirit; it is a practice and a way of life and is represented by the traditional medicine sweetgrass; when braided it represents the mind, body, and spirit.  The East represents the Physical side of things, and the traditional medicine is tobacco; used for offerings, tobacco ties and for ceremonial pipes, ceremonies  The South represents Mentality. By being mindful and respectful of all aspects of your daily activities represented by the traditional medicine of cedar; used as a medicine for tea as it is high in Vitamin C  The West represents Emotion and the sense of safety, belonging, and human comfort. The traditional medicine used and placed in the medicine wheel is sage which calms the heart to purify the mind; it is used for smudging and ceremonies. All these medicines can be used for smudging and ceremonies depending on the ceremony.  If you want to do a symbolic or significant ceremony, tobacco or a gift is usually passed to a local Indigenous elder to come and facilitate the ceremony. But if you just want to start something in a good way such as meetings, teachings, sharing circles, etc. Indigenous people would smudge first then begin their agendas.  Smudging can be related to other cultures or traditions. For example, other cultures like Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, etc. burn incense for their own purposes.  Sage is the medicine that is mainly used for smudging. It has a universal purpose so to speak. Other medicines such as cedar, tobacco, sweetgrass can be used along with sage for significant ceremonies such as sweat lodges, fasting ceremonies, sundances, etc.

Treaties are autonomous alliances made between the Canadian state and Indigenous peoples to share the land and the resources that come with the land

Indigenous inherent right to self-government consists of cultural, social, and economic development control The right to self-government is protected and entrenched into section 35 of the constitution, treaties, court decisions, and royal prerogatives Despite alliances and inherent rights entrenched into the constitution to share the land and its resources, the federal government continues to fail to address social and economical Indigenous issues This can be due to the lack of Indigenous representation and perspective at all levels of government

Treaties are constitutionally recognized current and historical agreements made between the Canadian state and Indigenous peoples' that acknowledge and affirm inherent titles and rights to self-determination regarding lands, resources, and culture. Indigenous inherent title is a unique collective right of practices and control over their ancestral territories. The right to self-determination is the right to practice, unmolested as an existing and autonomous sovereign nation or a third order of government within the Canadian Constitution.

Wampum Belts
           Wampum refers to white and purple beads from the Algonquian word "Wampumpeague" meaning a "string of white shell beads" and used as currency during the fur trade in Dutch and English colonies until the 1660's Wampums are visual memory keepers recording history and communicating ideas Beaded patterns represent a person, nation, event, invitation, shared values, and understandings/agreements between two or more parties. Traditional wampum belts were used as covenants and petitions for understanding Words spoken during an agreement are made into wampums to be used for ceremony, teaching, and reminders of law and values The Haudenosaunee used wampum belts of varying in size for diplomatic meetings (treaties) with Europeans and other First Nations From the early 17 century until the early 19 century, Wampum belts were used to record and legitimize formal or international agreements (treaties) between nations Some Wampum belts have been kept and preserved for the significant value they possess, such as oral agreements (treaties) made between nations concerning shared land and territory To prevent the value of oral agreements (treaties) translated through Wampum belts, agreements were occasionally announced publicly to community members Wampum belts were used to identify the significance of treaties between nations to share the territory for hunting or agriculture.

The history of Canada is a history of colonization, a history that invades, deprives, and gains control of a nation that benefits the oppressor at the expense of the oppressed due to loss of lands and resources through treaty making. The oppressor turned to racism to justify the oppression by designing policies, commissions, and acts (Emma Laroque). "Imperialism and colonialism has brought complete disorder to colonized peoples, disconnecting them from their histories, their landscapes, their languages, and their social relations and their own ways of thinking, feeling, and interacting with the world" (Linda Tuhiwai Smith, 2013, p.3) Pope Alexander VI.

The Doctrine of Discovery is a framework to claim territory to non-Christian land issued in 1493 and used by European monarchs to legitimize colonization The Doctrine considered Indigenous peoples as non-human; therefore the land was empty and considered terra nullius United Nations regarded the Doctrine of Discovery as `shameful' and they stated that it was the root of all the Indigenous discrimination and marginalization occurring today The Doctrine of Discovery is still relevant in today's legal arenas in Canada The Doctrine continues to influence Indigenous peoples lives in Canada today

The population of the Americas was solid, secure, and strong before and during contact. Turtle Island was a world thousands of years old where hundreds of cultures had thrived with their own governments and laws Turtle Island had thriving communities; sharing and contributing provided everyone a valuable place in society Diseases were brought to Canada, to which Indigenous peoples had no immunity. The declining Indigenous population made it easy for settlers to move in and create further rchaos in Indigenous communities Dispossession and racist laws have produced a long list of social problems for Indigenous peoples For generations Indigenous people have been in a life and death struggle to exist and will not except annihilation Most Canadians think Canada established formal title 151 years ago in the British North America Act (BNA). Yet, to this day negotiations between First Nations and the Crown continue to have First Nations surrender their titles and lands The British used/applied the Doctrine of Discovery to assert authority and jurisdiction over territories to prevent other colonizers from laying claim to the land Colonialism has three components: Dispossession; by depriving Indigenous peoples' of their traditional territory and segregating them to reserves. Dependence; some areas of land were particularly fertile and the Indigenous peoples were successful agricultural people and were able to grow abundant 11

crops and tried to sell them. Local white farmers complained about the competition and laws were passed (Pass System) forbidding Indigenous people to sell their produce or even leaving their reserves without an authorized pass signed from an Indian Agent. Poverty is not a by-product of domination but an essential element of it. Oppression; controlling all aspects of Indigenous peoples lives and limiting their ability to provide for themselves. Commissions, policies, acts were all designed to eliminate or assimilate Indigenous peoples by death or enfranchisement

The article examines the events leading up to the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and the Treaty of Niagara of 1764 (Covenant Chain of Friendship), which are fundamental documents in First Nation and Legal History that have never lost their significance and value between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples Indigenous peoples used the Two Row Wampum belt to translate the significance of The Royal Proclamation which was acknowledged and honoured by Crown officials The Two Row Wampum Belt founded in peace, friendship, and forever is enshrined into the Royal Proclamation and the Treaty of Niagara presented by Indigenous peoples during Nation-to-Nation meetings found in 1847 colonial reports First Nations have kept copies of the Royal Proclamation that validates rights to self-determination, protects interests, land use, and the unique relationship Indigenous peoples have with the British Crown (Canada) The Royal Proclamation 1763 became the Treaty of Niagara of 1764 when the meeting was summoned to renew the nation-to-nation relationship Approximately 2,000 Indigenous leaders present at this meeting, symbolically established the unique relationship between Indigenous peoples and the British Crown (Canada) developed through war and treaties for control of land, resources, and jurisdiction The document protects and authenticates ownership of land by Indigenous peoples that have never been conquered and were autonomous to their own sovereignty, acknowledged and respected by French and British officials

The Royal Proclamation is part of a treaty between First Nations and the Crown that guarantees First Nations right to self-government King George III in 1763 to officially claim British territory in North America after Britain won the Seven Years War Ownership of North America is given to King George The Royal Proclamation, ownership over North America is issued to King George but it explicitly states that Aboriginal title has existed and continues to exist, and that all land would be considered Aboriginal land until ceded by treaty Only the Crown can buy land from First Nations 13

Before Canada became a country, a key part of the defensive network of British North America was Britain's military alliances with First Nations During the War of 1812 First Nations warriors and Metis fighters helped defend British territories from American forces Thousands of First Nation and Metis warriors fought beside British troops Both the British and First Nations and Metis resisted against American expansion

Great Britain's unique relationship and support with First Nation's claim to territory in the American Midwest along with overlapping territorial were contributing factors when the United States officially declared war on Great Britain June 18th, 1812 British military strength in North America was not ideal when the United States declared war on Great Britain due to being engaged in warfare with Napoleon in Europe Britain's alliances with numerous First Nations including Metis were key elements for successfully defending invasions by the United states, which was acknowledged, honoured, and respected by Great Britain First Nations military leaders such as Tecumseh, Jon Brant, Chief Oshawana, Teyoninhokarawen (The Snipe), and Wabasha recruited Indigenous warriors to fight alongside Major-General Brock and Great Britain's war campaign and defence against the United States The end of the war marked a shift in Indian Policy: British stopped cultivating military alliances with First nations and the Indian Department renewed the process of obtaining Indian land in order to grow settlement Even though First Nations helped the British to keep and defend Canadian soil, assimilation policies were developed after the war that had devastating effects on the First Nation people First Nation were forced onto reserves so that settlers could take over the land and policies were made to "kill the Indian in the child" by removing the sons and daughters of native people to residential schools

Established by Sir Charles Bagot, Governor General of British North America The commission forced Native people on to reserves where they were given agricultural tools and livestock to perform European farming methods Form of assimilation and removal of land This commission proposed federally run Indian residential schools as a good tool for separating children from their parents and forcing Aboriginal peoples away from their traditional life Enforced Native people to choose citizenship or Indian status; this created disenfranchising most Indian and Metis people in Canada by forcing British citizenship upon them and completely erasing tribal identity and nationality 1846 ­ Indian Affairs Superintendent P.G. Anderson stated: "it is because you do not feel, or know the value of education; you would not give up your idle roving habits, to enable your children to receive instruction. Therefore you remain poor, ignorant and miserable. It is found you cannot govern yourself. And if left to be guided by your own judgment, you will never be better off than you are at the present; and your children will ever remain in ignorance. It has therefore been determined, that your children shall be sent to Schools, where they will forget their Indian habits and be instructed in all the necessary arts of civilized life, and become one with your white brethren."

Passed by the 5th Parliament of the Province of Canada in 1857 Part of the states effort to use government policy to assimilate Indigenous peoples to the economic and social customs of European settler society Indigenous people could not obtain land or receive a land grant from the federal government unless they were an "educated Indian" or of "good moral character" Indigenous people were expected to relinquish their treaty rights voluntarily, to be replaced by land parceled out for homesteading and voting privileges

The 1857 Act set a precedent for further paternalistic laws, like the Gradual Enfranchisement Act of 1869, which also sought to regulate Indigenous self determination These Acts were placed under the Indian Act in 1876 which sidestepped the rights of Indigenous peoples under the Royal Proclamation of 1763 This and other Acts were blatantly racist and lacked regard for the sovereignty of indigenous people These Acts were in place to diminish Indigenous power in order to fulfill the expansionist desire of the growing Canadian state The larger effort to strip Indigenous peoples of their rights under the repressive policies represented cultural genocide

It was rejected because Indigenous peoples did not want to join mainstream society and assimilate In 1985, Bill C-31 altered Section 12, which denied women Indian status if they married a non-Indian man. When the Indian Act was amended, Bill C-31 allowed those who lost their status to regain it 2009 Indian Act was amended so that those who lost their status and regained it have the ability to pass on their status for more than one generation Currently, there is Indian Status 6.1 and 6.2.

When Europeans first arrived to this continent a trading relationship quickly developed with Indigenous peoples. This relationship was managed by making agreements (Treaties) Treaties are managed up to this day in regards to land claims through the "modern treaties" making process between the Crown and Indigenous peoples The Treaty making process and relationship has been around before Canada and the United States were established as countries. The Treaties address peace, friendship, and coexistence; military alliance; trade; and economic development Modern Treaties are more detailed, comprehensive, complex, and challenging to negotiate After the Second World War, the Indian Act was amended in 1951. This removed the prohibition of Indigenous peoples to obtain legal council and to pursue legal action regarding land claims In 1969, Prime Minister Trudeau released the rejected "White Paper" that would extinguish `special rights' for Indigenous peoples. The White paper suggested existing treaties were limited and minimal which denied Indigenous peoples heritage, status, identity, and treaty relationship to the Crown Indigenous peoples widely rejected and opposed the White Paper notably by Harold Cardinal's `The Unjust Society'. This led to the Calder split decision of the Supreme Court of Canada that acknowledged the existence in Canadian Law of Indigenous title regardless of any grant or act of recognition by the Crown August 1973, Minister Chrétien announced that the Government of Canada would negotiate land claims with Aboriginal peoples who had not concluded historic treaties with the Crown and whose Aboriginal title to land had not been superseded by law

With the Indian Act of 1869, the government set out its own vision of future Canada-First Nations relations: an aggressive colonizing project of assimilation not only of First nations in those territories but of all First Nations throughout the nation Amendments to the 1869 Act and in new Acts, spelled out, in increasing detail, a colonial structure that passed control of First Nations people and communities into the hands of the Indian Affairs Department 17



 

   

 

 

 







The foundation of British policy was the historic Proclamation of 1763. The principles it laid down with respect to land and its inherent respect for the "national" character of First Nations formed the core of British-Indian relations and re-emerged in the late 1970s as the baseline of Canadian-First Nations relations In the Proclamation's place, the relationship between Canada and First nations was shaped by other influences and "cultural" forces rather than legal principles As Canada's first Prime Minister, J. A. Macdonald, informed Parliament that it was the nation's duty to "do away with the tribal system and assimilate the Indian peoples in all respects to the inhabitants of the Dominion " Assimilation became the enduring justification for federal colonialism First Nation were self-governing within their recognized jurisdictions including all internal affairs until the Indian Act of 1869 After Confederation the responsibility for conducting relations with First Nations was shifted from the Imperial to the Federal Government The Act provided that any Indian judged to be educated, free from debt, and of good moral character could apply to receive land within the colony and the rights accompanying it. Now focused on assimilation Each successive Indian Act in the period under review carried enfranchisement provisions During Macdonald's government the phase "Nations...of Indians" was no longer appropriate as, in his estimation, Indians were like children; they were like "persons underage, incapable of the management of their own affairs" and, therefore, the government had to assume the "onerous duty of ... guardianship" The title of the 1869 of Act, "Act for the Gradual Enfranchisement of Indians, the Better Management of Indian Affairs," indicates its dedication to assimilation The Indian Act strictly limited band council authority and the powers of the council to make laws for communities were limited to such a degree that they were no longer meaningful ways self-governing For the sake of the government's assimilative mission, the independence of community leaders was to be ended In the second Act, the Consolidated Indian Act of 1876, the constitutional formula of 1869 was repeated with the implication that First Nations would lose control of almost every aspect of their communities Two paths were laid out and maintained unquestioningly until after the Second World War: one for non-Aboriginal Canadians of full participation in the affairs of their community, province and nation; and one for First Nations people stripped of the power of self determination, separated from provincial and national life and existing in communities whose colonization was profound and immutable Under the Indian Acts of the pre-Second World War period, First Nations people could join the national community only as enfranchised, assimilated individuals. In a sense they were meant to be immigrants in their own land moving not across an ocean but across constitutional jurisdictions from a federally controlled reserve to a province The creation of Indian status denied First Nations' people the power to determine, for themselves, who belonged to their communities 18







The "Indian status" created in the Indian Act grew out of Victorian cultural assumptions: that property ownership was the foundation of civilized society and that both ownership and decent of property were attached, primarily, to men The Acts before and after the war maintained the dominance of federal authority and, after 1951, sanctioned "legislative inference" by provinces, many of which felt they had no constitutional obligations to First Nation Canadians, had little time or concern for them, and few funds Trudeau/Chretien White Paper proposed total and immediate integration; federal authority, the treaties, and the Indian Act were to be rolled up and First Nations communities and individuals would be passed into the care of the provinces. The White Paper was strongly rejected

After the Treaty of Paris, which concluded the Seven Years War with France, British King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 (p. 121), stating that any lands within the territorial confines of the new governments that had not been ceded by the Indians "are reserved to them, or any of them as their Hunting Grounds." (p. 121) To prevent fraud, the proclamation provided a way in which lands could be acquired for settlement Indian Act has existed as a tool of a large government bureaucracy "to deal" with Indigenous people The administration of Natives was in the hands of the military, reflecting the role and importance of Native people in inter European wars. After the American War of Independence and the War of 1812, European settlers believed that Natives posed a potential threat to them Agrarianization and christianization were seen as the best means of "civilizing" Indians Not until 1860 did Britain assign full control of Indian matters to the colonies In 1867, the British North America Act explicitly made "Indians and lands reserved for Indians" a federal responsibility In 1880, a separate Indian Affairs Department was setup under John A. Macdonald, who was both Minister of the Interior and prime minister at the time Indian Act banned traditional ceremonies and dances up until 1951 Indian agents, who were white and male and required no formal qualifications, enforced laws that banned, for example, dressing traditionally off reserve without their permission Indian Agents were given a great deal of discretionary power to control various aspects of people's lives by denying them access to sell the corps they had grown to issuing food vouchers Indian Act discriminated against women as section 12 (1)(b) denied registration to "a woman who married a person who is not an Indian ... her children would

likewise not have status, unlike the children of White women who married Status Indian men" (p. 125) The United Nations condemned Canada in 1981 after Sandra Lovelace of the Tobique Reserve in New Brunswick complained that she was denied the right to live on her reserve after her failed marriage to a non-Native. Finally, the discriminatory clause was removed with the passage of Bill C-31 in 1985 Enfranchisement was the loss of Indian status upon acquisition of the right to vote and full citizenship. This whole process goes back to 1857, when the United Canada passed a law titled "An Act of the Gradual Civilization of the Indian Tribes in the Canadas" as a means of granting full citizenship to Native people If a Native could speak, read, and write in English, was in good moral character, free of debt, and advanced in elementary branches of education they were to be reported to the governor who could then declare "that such Indian is enfranchised under this Act ... and thereof" (p. 127) If a Native met the criteria, he was put on probation for a year, granted 20 hectares of land, and given full citizenship after one year Canada gave up enfranchisement in 1985 with the passage of Bill C-31 The Indian Act was amended so that people who had given up status could regain it

The Pass System was a policy that segregated First Nations to the reserve This policy prevented Indigenous people from leaving the reserve without having an authorized Pass that was signed by an Indian Agent In order to get an authorized Pass from the Agent, there had to be a legitimate reason in order for a pass to be issued. The Pass was given a specific time frame. Otherwise, a person could be jailed Passes were only given out for hunting, never to attend cultural ceremonies or to attend children in Residential Schools. The Pass System would strengthen the Indian Act imposed on First Nations This solidified the Indian Act from First Nations to even think of getting legal advice in regards to their lands and resources This prevented First Nations from surveying, exploring, and protecting their land from exploitation without their knowledge and from inquiring about the infrastructure and business conducted on their lands The Pass System prevented First Nations from being successful on their own lands, condemning them from travelling to markets to sell their crops for profit The Pass System was motivated by the settlement of the Prairies, the construction of the railway, the Northwest Rebellion, and by white settlers who

were complaining that First Nations had an unfair advantage to the land when it came to farming their crops Even among First Nations and Canadian society today very little is known about the Pass System and the policies surrounding its implementation

In June 1986, the Mississauga Tribal Claims Council submitted a number of claims, including the Toronto Purchase claim, to the Specific Claims Branch of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND). The claims were submitted on behalf of five First Nations, one of which was the Mississaugas of the New Credit. The claim in respect of the Toronto Purchase alleges that a vast expanse of land in southern Ontario, which includes Metropolitan Toronto, had never been properly surrendered to the Crown. It also alleged that the transactions concerning the purchase, which took place in 1787 and 1805, were tainted by breaches of the fiduciary duty owed by the Crown to the Mississauga Nation The Mississaugas, a branch of the Ojibwa or Chippewa Indians, were occupying lands on the north shore of Lake Huron when they first encountered Europeans in the early 17th century. To the south of the Mississaugas resided the Hurons, who at that time inhabited the lands around Georgian Bay to the north shore of Lake Ontario. Across Lake Ontario, in present-day New York State, lay the territory of the Iroquois, who were organized into a confederacy of Five Nations.

The colonists realized that Toronto was a well-protected site, perfect for Loyalists and other settlers; it also provided passage north to more abundant hunting grounds that would ensure the survival of the fur trade Colonists entered into approximately 20 different agreements with various Mississauga groups, and, in 1787, arranged the Toronto Purchase, paying three groups of Mississauga 1700 in cash and goods, which they later claimed gave

John Grave Simcoe was the lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada during the colonial regime He was looking for a route to St. Lawrence, many of these routes were already established by Indigenous people Lake Ontario to Lake Simcoe portage route was used for 2,000 years as it was the fastest route, so Simcoe thought it would be a good route for the highway When Simcoe met a group of Mississauga's along the route, they inform him about a faster route Simcoe decides to build a colonial road as straight as possible at all costs and named it after Young, an Official back in Britain Simcoe had a survey dilemma as he wanted it to be a straight road so he hired Augustus Jones as the surveyor and constructor of the new road He wanted a road from the newly planned settlement of York, Upper Canada to Lake Simcoe Augustus Jones was assisted by a Chief from the Mississauga's, Wabakinine, to help him lay the compass line 30 miles north to lake Simcoe In the 1790s, Chief Wasbasi created the route 200 yards from the exact point they wanted to be at You can see the 200 yard difference in one spot along Yonge St. where it seems to bend off the path a bit

Simcoe proposed the `military street' as a strategic route to help protect Upper Canada form American invasion. Yonge Street was known as "the longest street in the world" when it was completed in February 20, 1796 The town of York was created from Loyalists moving northward along the upper St. Lawrence and lower Great Lakes which led to the creation of Upper Canada and York, known as Toronto When war broke out between England and France in 1793, Simcoe realized that capital Newark (Niagara on the lake) and its Lake Erie trade route would be vulnerable to attack if America decided to support its French allies. Simcoe transferred the capital to Toronto Bay and founded York as the capital 24

 







Simcoe planned major roads, knowing their value for defence and for expanding development Governor's Road (Dundas Street) would run West to the Detroit River and Yonge Street would go North to the Holland River, creating a link with Georgian Bay on Lake Huron and Michilimackinac Simcoe set off on September 25, 1793 with a group of soldiers and native guides to explore north of Lake Ontario, following the Carrying Place Trail, a portage route running 45 km from Lake Ontario to Lake Simcoe, following the Humber and Holland Rivers. The trail was a necessary route, since the Humber's shallow water was often a difficult route to navigate, it froze solid in the winter and its steep bank offered little defence against attack Simcoe's strategic route did not follow the natural contours of the land. It was truly a military road, running as straight as an arrow from York to Holland landing. Simcoe named the road Yonge Street, after Sir George Yonge, secretary of war in the British Cabinet and a family friend Today, the habour front shore plains remains Toronto's downtown core and Simcoe's military street stretches some 1,900 km

An Indigenous pathway that became popular among fur traders, the trail allowed for strenuous portaging from the mouth of the Humber River to the Holland, which connected Lake Ontario with Lake Simcoe. It was a channel for coureurs du bois like Etienne Brule and for Jesuit missionaries to bring Christianity to the so-called New World 178 years after its first recorded use by Samuel de Champlain's Huron allies, it was supplanted by the construction of John Graves Simcoe's new military road, Yonge Street, named after Simcoe's family friend, British war secretary Sir George Yonge. A long road between Lake Ontario and Lake Huron would allow, Simcoe hoped, for the sustained success and defense of a new temporary capital of Upper Canada ­ an upstart colony called York, named after the second song of King George III

Yonge and Dundas was once part of a major portage route used by Indigenous people The Toronto Carrying Place was the most important First Nations trail in Southern Ontario and the main route connecting Lake Ontario with Lake Simcoe and the Northern Great Lakes The Carry Place Trail was a vital trade route for the First Nations and also later by the French and English settlers

The Toronto Carrying Place was a Native trail that led from the mouth of the Humber River on Lake Ontario to the Holland River near Lake Simcoe. For much of its 45 km (26 miles) It was an alternative to the more traditional route up the Ottawa River and was particularly useful to the peoples living north and south of Lake Ontario. At the time of contact with Europeans, the Toronto Carrying Place was used by the Wendat (Huron), Onondawahgah (Seneca), and later by the Mississauga First Nations. Étienne Brûlé may have been the first European on the Carrying Place, and the trail was extensively used by European explorers, traders, priests, and officials from 1615 until the early 1800s. Though quickly supplanted by Yonge Street, the Carrying Place had an enormous influence on the growth of Toronto and Southern Ontario. The Colonial settlement of York ­ later renamed Toronto ­ was founded largely because of the Carrying Place's easy access into the Northwest

The aim of Residential School System was cultural genocide" The Truth and Reconciliation Commission estimates that there are 80,000 survivors and the passing on of unresolved trauma created an intergenerational legacy of the residential school system Today, Aboriginal survivors, their children, grandchildren and communities are engaged in healing processes to recognize the history and impacts of this

Four policy alternatives were used to solve the "Indian question:" 1. extermination; 2. slavery; 3. insulation (reserves); 4. assimilation Bagot Commission report proposed federally run residential schools as good tools for separating children from their parents and forcing Aboriginal peoples away from their traditional life 1867 Constitution Act, reinforced the policy of assimilation designed to change Native people from savage to civilized children were forcibly taken from their families by priests, Indian agents, and police officers students were discouraged and often ordered out of school by officials by the age of 16. The 2001 Truth Commission into Genocide in Canada documents the death of more than 50,000 Native children in residential school system by the Roman Catholic church, the United Church of Canada, the Anglican Church of Canada, and the federal government children were killed by beating, poisoning, electric shock, starvation, prolonged exposure to sub-zero cold while naked, and medical experimentation Residential school syndrome, a combination of historical trauma and a sub-type of post traumatic stress disorder has been found due to these schools

The federal government of Canada didn't acknowledge this history until 2008 Two primary objectives of residential school was to remove and isolate Indigenous children from the influence their homes, families, traditions and cultures, and to be assimilated into the dominant culture During this era, Indigenous children were often forcibly removed from their homes and brought to residential schools to be "civilized" Living conditions were appalling and often caused disease, hunger, stress, and despair Many children were physically, verbally, and/or sexually abused at these schools If children spoke their Native language they would often be physically punished Some children were locked in closets, cages, basements, and forced to eat their own vomit Some children managed to run away but many who did in the winter months died in the cold weather Many children in residential schools and adults who have experienced residential schools have committed suicide These schools have created intergenerational trauma, which passes on from generation to generation Some effects of intergenerational trauma are suicide, addiction, and loss of self identity

Games were played for the creator as well as to toughen up young warriors for war and for recreation The first settler to see the sport being played was a French Jesuit Missionary, Jean de Brebeuf A dentist, William George Beers, was responsible for changing the rules of the game so that only a certain number of people could play and he changed the ball from a deerskin ball or wooden ball to a rubber ball In 1883 a touring team of Iroquois natives visited Scotland to play.

Jarvis Street is named after William Jarvis (father) and Samuel Jarvis (son) who had a history of slavery, violence, and inequality They were unsavoury characters described as turkeys, incompetent, lazy, selfish, dishonest just to name a few characteristics that can be found in Toronto literature to describe the father and son William Jarvis fought to keep his slaves when Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe was seeking to make slavery illegal. Because of Jarvis' opposition the law was watered down to gradually phase out slavery instead of ending it When Samuel Jarvis was Chief Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Upper Canada, a position that was handed to him just like everything else, he was caught embezzling some 4,000 pounds from First Nations groups in the area

Jarvis was apart of a family compact, which were elite wealthy conservative families who controlled affairs of the state The Family Compact ran things officially and unofficially Samuel Jarvis the son of William Jarvis is who the street is named after Samuel expected that he would be given a position in government with little to no effect, which was true He wasn't well known for his work ethic or personal qualities He was known for his quick temper and irresponsibility with money He murdered Thomas Rideout in a duel in 1820s. Thomas called Jarvis out for owing him money as Samuel Jarvis was well known for making poor decision with his money. Jarvis refused to pay him so they had a duel. Thomas fired before he was suppose to which allowed Jarvis to have a free shot, which killed Thomas Jarvis became the Chief superintendent of Indian affairs and he was in charge of everything on behalf of Indigenous people. He did nothing but sell Indigenous land He had the legal right to do so but as the superintendent he was suppose to put that money in a trust so the community could use the money towards their land but he didn't and put it in his own account

Its first report, delivered in January 1844, was directly responsible for Jarvis's being stripped of his official rank in all but name that May and for his forced retirement the following year Jarvis's attempt to defend himself only resulted in new evidence being gathered against him Office of Chief Superintendent was abolished in 1845 and Jarvis' was forced to retire The government never forced him to restore the missing funds for which it claimed he was responsible for In 1818 his house, Hazelburn, which was built for his family 23 years before, was torn down to make way for the street which still bears Jarvis's name
