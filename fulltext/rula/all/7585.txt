Abstract

This paper is a summary of the research conducted during the development and design of Rural Access To Education Through Digital Media, a pilot education technology project in Tipling, Nepal. Beginning with an analysis of the relevant socioeconomic factors affecting school attainment nationally and those affecting Tipling in particular; the current challenges to formal and informal education are identified. The considerable potential of digital media and ICTs to address long-standing issues of access to both childhood and adult learning and thereby contribute to international development and education reform efforts are explored. Key project considerations and challenges are discussed along with project outcomes.

Keywords: ICTs, Rural Education, Literacy, International Development, Education Technology
