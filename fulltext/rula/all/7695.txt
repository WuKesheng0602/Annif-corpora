Abstract "Is There Really No Time to be Nice?": A Micro-level Analysis of Antecedents to Incivility

Vanessa Martini Master of Science in Management, 2018 Ted Rogers School of Management Ryerson University

Defined as a type of mistreatment of low intensity and ambiguous intent to harm, incivility is a persistent and troubling workplace phenomenon. Rooted in the self-determination theory, the impact of time pressure on workplace incivility was considered. Using an experimental design, 62 participants acted as managers in mock performance appraisals; half in each time condition (`time pressure' and `no time pressure'). Sessions were video recorded and two third-party raters, blind to the manipulation, coded the verbal and non-verbal communication behaviours of the managers and employees. Results showed that time pressure had a non-significant impact on manager incivility, and the number and type of questions the manager asked. However, significant results supported the idea that incivility breeds incivility. Supplemental analyses demonstrated that while self-reported incivility was unrelated to either third party or employee reports of manager incivility, a significant relationship existed between third-party and employee reports of manager incivility. Despite insignificant findings regarding time pressure as an antecedent of incivility, further exploration is encouraged.

Chapter 1: Introduction Background on Incivility Organizational research has typically focused its attention on explicit negative behaviours that are of greater intensity, including sexual harassment and workplace aggression, rather than on less intense deviant behaviours (Lim, Cortina & Magley, 2008, Pearson, Andersson, & Wegner, 2001) which some might consider simply uncivil. The phenomenon of uncivil behaviours in the workplace has been termed by Andersson and Pearson (1999) as workplace incivility, and they have defined it as "low-intensity deviant behaviour with ambiguous intent to harm the target, in violation of workplace norms for mutual respect" (p.457). In other studies it has been referred to as bullying, emotional abuse, mobbing, or mistreatment suggesting that these are related constructs (Cortina, Magley, Williams, & Langhout, 2001) and that some overlap does exist (Estes & Wang, 2008). However, what differentiates incivility from bullying, psychological aggression, violence, and sexual harassment in the workplace are incivility's low intensity and its unclear intent to harm (Cortina, 2008; Lim & Lee, 2011). Low intensity is characterized by three dichotomies: passive, as compared to active; verbal rather than physical; and lastly, indirect as opposed to direct (Pearson & Porath, 2005). The ambiguous nature of incivility makes it difficult to detect, and therefore difficult to manage and prevent (Cortina, 2008). It is necessary to make a distinction between instigated and experienced incivility when considering the frequency of incivility; for the remainder of this paper, I will refer to "instigated" incivility as the act of being uncivil towards another individual, whereas "experienced" incivility is when individuals feel as though another individual has been uncivil towards them. The current study, however, will measure uncivil behaviours from an objective third-party rater's perspective. Because of the ambiguous nature of incivility, these concepts can differ in their frequencies, even if the situation itself is the same. It is easy for instigators to deny their intent, arguing that their behaviours were misinterpreted, or perhaps even that the target is too sensitive. Thus, labeling behaviour as incivility is a challenge in itself (Pearson et al., 2000). Workplace mistreatment is comprised of "overt or covert bullying; verbal, nonverbal, psychological, physical abuse; or disrespect, humiliation, intimidation, or aggressive or hostile communication and behaviour and has been categorized as interpersonal or policy-related mistreatment" (Hsieh,
1





Sönmez, Apostolopoulos & Lemke, 2016). Incivility is a form of mistreatment within the workplace (Sakurai & Jex, 2012) which expresses itself through degradation, disrespect, and condescension (Birkeland & Nerstad, 2016); rude and discourteous actions (Andersson & Pearson, 1999); not keeping promises and not helping out others (Estes & Wang, 2008), and being ignored, excluded or undermined in front of subordinates, coworkers, or superiors (Lim & Lee, 2011). It is interesting to note that incivility typically comes from above, such that it is three times more likely to be instigated by someone in a higher position compared to the target. Additionally, it was found that instigators are more likely to be male than female (Pearson et al., 2000). It has been suggested that workplace incivility is a Western phenomenon, as western culture is individualistic and promotes individual achievement; a study by Liu, Chi, Friedman, and Tsai (2009) found supporting evidence for this, which indicated that incivility is reduced by collectivistic values. Lim and Lee (2011), however, conducted a later study that found conflicting results, indicating that incivility is not solely a Western phenomenon, and is not foreign to the Asian workplace. This more recent evidence suggests that incivility is an issue that affects not only North American organizations, but also affects organizations across the globe. Background on Related Constructs Incivility can often be hard to untangle from a number of related constructs (Bowling & Beehr, 2006; Hershcovis, 2010). These related constructs, falling into the all-encompassing construct of interpersonal mistreatment, include, but are not limited to, bullying, abusive supervision, incivility, mobbing, workplace aggression, social undermining, emotional abuse, generalized workplace abuse (Bowling & Beehr, 2006), and I would add, disrespectful inquiry (Van Quaquebeke & Felps, 2016). They are so similar and have so much overlap, that it has been argued that the different constructs should actually be integrated and amalgamated into one construct (Fox & Spector, 2005). In fact, when conducting a meta-analysis examining workplace mistreatment outcomes, Bowling and Beehr (2006) merged numerous forms of mistreatment together; this included incivility and bullying, among others, as they were under the assumption



2



that each of these mistreatment constructs are essentially the same construct. In accordance with incivility, any member of the organization can instigate bullying (Hershcovis, 2010) which has been defined as: "instances where an employee is repeatedly and over a period of time exposed to negative acts...from coworkers, supervisors, or subordinates (Einarsen, 2000). A debated topic in the incivility literature is the role of power imbalances (Cortina et al., 2001; Estes & Wang, 2008; Pearson & Porath, 2005), with numerous studies suggesting a significant relationship (Estes & Wang, 2008; Pearson & Porath, 2005); similarly, it has been argued in the bullying literature that bullying is often present when there are power imbalances between instigators and targets. Additionally, a construct comparison study by Hershcovis (2010) found that regardless of propositions that bullying would have more significant outcomes as compared to incivility, this was not the case in regard to the outcome variables job satisfaction, turnover intent, psychological well-being, and affective commitment. Abusive supervision is defined as: "subordinates' perceptions of the extent to which their supervisors engage in the sustained display of hostile verbal and nonverbal behaviours, excluding physical contact" (Tepper, 2000, p.178). What specifically differentiates this construct from the related constructs is that while the other constructs focus on a number of different instigators, abusive supervision is focused on only one type of instigator: the supervisor (Hershcovis, 2010). However, when related constructs, such as incivility are considered specifically in relation to supervisor-employee relations, the distinction is that incivility is of lower intensity than abusive supervision. Another definitional point that makes differentiating abusive supervision from incivility instigated by a supervisor challenging is that they are both non-physical (Hershcovis, 2010). The construct of disrespectful inquiry involves asking minimal questions, not being open to questions being asked, and listening inattentively when questions are asked (Van Quaquebeke & Felps, 2016). These behaviours overlap with the construct of incivility. For example, falling within incivility is if the instigator pays little attention to what their targets have to say, shows little interest in their opinions, or flat out ignores them (Hershcovis, 2011). In Cortina et al.'s (2001) Workplace Incivility Scale these behaviours are measured by the following items: "Paid
3





little attention to your statement or showed little interest in your opinion?" and "Ignored or excluded you from professional camaraderie?" These items appear to demonstrate the overlap, or relatedness of the constructs. Both disrespectful inquiry and incivility involve interactions between employees in the workplace that influence the motivation of one of the parties. Why is Incivility Important? Incivility in the workplace is an important concept (Estes & Wang, 2015) and it deserves to be recognized and further explored. A study by Reio and Ghosh (2009) identified some alarming numbers related to workplace incivility. Their research indicated that 54% of participants said they took part in interpersonal incivility at least once a year. This includes behaviours such as making fun of an individual, saying hurtful things, or being rude to someone. These uncivil behaviours were reported to occur on a daily basis by approximately 4% of participants. According to a study by Reio (2011), nearly 76% of participates reported that within the last year they had been the victim of incivility at the hands of their supervisor. These numbers are concerning, and therefore it is necessary to not only offer more awareness and exploration of the outcomes, but perhaps more importantly, to consider what causes individuals to engage in these acts and how workplaces can work to diminish the occurrences. While the presence of incivility in itself is alarming, numerous organizational researchers have suggested that workplace incivility has a myriad of detrimental outcomes (Johnson & Indvik, 2001; Pearson & Andersson, 1999; Reio & Ghosh, 2009). These outcomes include those that impact the organization, such as decreased job satisfaction and organizational productivity and increased employee turnover (Cortina et al., 2001; Lim et al., 2008); decreased organizational commitment (Kabat-Farr et al., 2016; Pearson, 1999; Pearson, Andersson & Porath, 2000; Reio & Ghosh, 2009); and decreased work effort (Sakurai & Jex, 2012). Due to these outcomes and the delays and disruptions that come as a result, organizations also face increased financial costs (Pearson & Porath, 2005); it has been suggested that workplace incivility can cost organizations approximately $14,000 per year for each employee (Pearson & Porath, 2009). Incivility also impacts at the individual level, as it is related to decreased employee wellbeing, including increased psychological stress (Cortina et al., 2001; Reio & Ghosh, 2009), emotional exhaustion (Hur et al., 2015), burnout (Spence Laschinger & Read,
4





2016), and negative affect (Porath & Pearson, 2012) and it has negative impacts on perceptions of physical health (Reio & Ghosh, 2009). As if these outcomes were not concerning enough, incivility can be also be a foundation for more explicit acts of workplace aggression (Pearson et al., 2000). Andersson and Pearson (1999) also demonstrated that incivility takes on a spiral effect within an organization. Incivility creates a pattern of increases in consequences, whereby the uncivil act by one individual leads to a response of greater incivility by the other individual, such that their actions continue to escalate into more uncivil, potentially aggressive, behaviours resulting in an "incivility spiral". Due to these detrimental consequences, it is believed that researching the factors that contribute to instances of workplace incivility is worth great consideration (Cortina et al., 2001). Employees are highly important assets of organizations (Chaaudhary & Mukhtar, 2016); thus with the implications that incivility has on individuals and the organization, organizations should be seeking out ways to understand and decrease incivility to create a more positive environment where employees feel safe, respected, and are taken care of. Andersson and Pearson's (1999) `incivility spiral' suggests that an organizational culture of incivility can be contributed to not only by participating directly in uncivil acts, but also by witnessing incivility among others. Further, a study conducted by Pearson and Porath (2004) found that although the majority of respondents felt that their organization would respond with warnings or consequences for those individuals who instigate physical or sexual harassment, or offered threats, less than half of respondents believed that the organization would respond to acts of workplace incivility. Therefore, organizations must understand the impacts of incivility and begin to respond to incivility in a way that demonstrates that it is not welcome. This will aid in changing the organizational culture to a culture of civility, and will result in improved employee well-being as well as improve employee productivity, decrease turnover, and decrease overall financial costs (Reio & Ghosh, 2009). Additionally, a culture of civility encourages support and collaboration, and is beneficial to individual and professional growth (Reio & Ghosh, 2009). In order to understand and minimize incivility at work, it is necessary to understand what causes it. While the majority of empirical research on incivility has studied the impacts of uncivil behaviours in the workplace, fewer studies have been conducted on its' antecedents (Blau & Andersson, 2005; Meier & Semmer, 2012). Therefore, using a deductive research strategy, the
 5



current research seeks to further explore the potential causes of incivility in the workplace at a micro level; more specifically: does time pressure increase the likelihood of incivility in the workplace? This is an explanatory research question, as it should explain the relationship between time pressure and the presence of uncivil behaviours in the workplace. The current study is important for several reasons. First, while incivility research has largely been concerned with the targets of incivility (Reio & Ghosh, 2009), the current study focuses instead on the instigator, thereby allowing the antecedents of incivility to be considered. Second, instances of workplace incivility and their negative impacts are increasing (van Jaarsveld, Walker, & Skarlicki, 2010) thus, determining the contributing factors may allow for future exploration of methods that can reduce the probability and occurrences of uncivil behaviours in the workplace.

Chapter 2: Review of Prior Research As stated previously, while a great number of studies consider the outcomes or consequences of workplace incivility, a lesser number focus on the antecedents (Blau & Andersson, 2005; Meier & Semmer, 2012). Nevertheless, incivility has become a hot topic of organizational studies in recent years (Kunkel, Carnevale & Henderson, 2015; Torkelson, Holm, Bäckström & Schad, 2016). This section will begin with a review of the literature that focuses on the antecedents of incivility. The literature review revealed several trends regarding the nature of incivility antecedents, and in line with Chris (2014), I have categorized these as three levels of antecedents: macro, meso, and micro. Additionally, within the categorizations I not only focus on the main antecedents, I also touch on the commonly used underlying theoretical frameworks as well as the relevant incivility relationships within each category. Macro Level of Analysis The first level of analysis labelled "macro" contains the incivility antecedents that are at the organizational level. Among the most common antecedents in this group are those found by Torkelson et al. (2016), which include first, organizational change and lack of job security and second, organizational culture (Pearson & Porath, 2004). Organizational changes such as restructuring, downsizing, and mergers can all cause uncertainty and stress for individuals and may also result in a "me first" attitude (Pearson, Andersson & Porath, 2005), causing an individual to do whatever he or she believes is necessary to remove or limit uncertainty, including discontinuing behaviours that had once signalled respect for coworkers (Pearson et al., 2000). Pearson et al. (2005) provide a potential explanation, such that organizational pressures are associated with norms that are being corroded in the workplace, which ultimately describes incivility. This brings us to the second antecedent of incivility at the organizational level: organizational culture, defined as the values, beliefs, and norms that are shared by the individuals within an organization. Organizational culture can be separated into a number of different kinds, including relation-oriented, task-oriented, or hierarchy-oriented (An & Kang, 2016). An and
 7



Kang (2016) conducted a study that considered the relationship between organizational culture and bullying, finding that those who considered their organization as hierarchy-oriented (a culture described as having a high level of control, formalization, and rivalry), had the highest prevalence of bullying. Interestingly, those who considered their organizational culture to be relation-oriented (one that is focused on interpersonal relationships based on mutual respect and trust) were found to have the lowest prevalence of bullying. An organization's culture can reject incivility, as in the relation-oriented culture, or it can foster it, as demonstrated through a hierarchy-oriented culture. It is common for individuals within an organization to follow the signals of the leaders in regards to what is considered appropriate behaviour (Cortina, 2008) therefore it is not outrageous to find that poor leadership has also been discovered to lead to acts of incivility (Pearson & Porath, 2005). Supervisors and managers may unknowingly create a culture of incivility by encouraging efficiency and competition. Furthermore, a workplace that has a culture of informality could unknowingly be encouraging acts of incivility. Meso Level of Analysis The second level of analysis regarding antecedents of incivility has been labelled: "meso". Meso antecedents are at the group, or interpersonal level. These factors include lack of interpersonal support and reciprocity, poor leadership, and power and status differentials. These interactions can be between coworkers (Andersson & Pearson, 1999), between employees and supervisors or those with higher power (Pearson & Porath, 2005), or they can be between employees and customers (Van Jaarsveld et al., 2010). Social exchange theory (SET) is one of the most well known theories for understanding workplace behaviour, used primarily in the psychology, social psychology and management fields (Cropanzano, Anthony, Daniels, & Hall, 2016; Cropanzano & Mitchell, 2005). This theory is concerned with reciprocity, or the mutual exchanges that are present between two parties (Sakurai & Jex, 2012), indicating its appropriateness for this group/interpersonal level of analysis. It has been applied in research attempting to comprehend the association between employee-supervisor interactions and the employee's ensuing affective and behavioural results (Sakurai & Jex, 2012) and was also used by Torkelson et al. (2016) in considering experienced incivility from a co-worker as an antecedent of instigated incivility. Additionally, although SET
8





has the ability to explain a number of different social phenomena in a post hoc method, it is with a priori predictions involving workplace behaviour where SET lacks ability (Cropanzano & Mitchell, 2005). Post hoc research looks at data that has been collected from a finished experiment and looks for differences between means and analyzes the data for patterns (Fields, 2010). In contrast, in a priori research, specific predictions are planned before hand. While post hoc procedures may be useful when considering incivility from the targets' perspective and looking for patterns found in retrospective data, they are less useful when considering incivility from the instigators perspective. This suggests that SET is not sufficient in predicting the root cause of incivility. While it can predict the continuous spiral once it is already in motion, it seems to lack the ability to sufficiently predict the initial act that sets the spiral in motion. Having predictions is much more beneficial when the focus is on the antecedents of instigated incivility, as it allows for the empirical testing of these specific relationships, and offers explanations that may not involve interpersonal exchanges. Instances of incivility were found to be directly related to low levels of support from coworkers (Torkelson et al., 2016), as well as related to weak relationships with coworkers (Reio & Ghosh, 2009), and though mediated by anger, it was found that a lack of reciprocity from coworkers was indirectly related to incivility (Semmer & Meier, 2012). On a similar note, and in line with Andersson and Pearson's (1999) incivility spiral effect, multiple studies have since demonstrated that an experience of incivility has led to instigated incivility from the original target (Pearson & Porath, 2005; Torkelson et al., 2016; Van Jaarsveld et al., 2010). Additionally, Jex and Sakurai (2012) conducted a two-wave survey study where they found that at time 2, coworker incivility was positively related to emotional strain and counterproductive work behaviours (CWBs), and was negatively related to time 2 work effort. The relationships between incivility and both CWB and work effort were mediated by negative affect. Further, they also tested the moderating role of supervisor social support in the relationships between negative emotions and CWB and work effort. They found that this relationship existed for work effort, such that when employees felt that they had high levels of supervisor social support, then negative emotions were less strongly related to work effort than if they had low levels of support. Therefore, since there is an abundance of literature that suggests that negative affect is an antecedent to incivility, and since this study suggests that supervisor social support moderates the



9



extent of negative affect, then perhaps supervisors have a significant role in controlling levels of incivility. Although supervisors could play a significant role in reducing workplace incivility, incivility instigated by supervisors is quite prevalent in organizations (Reio, 2011). It was found that the most common acts of incivility reported on a modified version of Cortina et al.'s (2001) Workplace Incivility Scale were "paying little attention to your statements or show little interest in your opinion", "put you down or was condescending to you", and "doubted your judgment on a matter over which you have responsibility." Interestingly, the results also suggest that compared to females, males reported being the victim more of supervisor incivility (Reio, 2011). An interesting study by Brees, Martinko, and Harvey (2015) sought to determine whether supervisor behaviour was in fact abusive, or whether employee personality impacted perceptions of abusive supervision. To explore their question, they had participants take a personality assessment and then they watched a video role-play of a performance evaluation. All participants watched the same video. Following the video participants were asked to talk about how abusive they perceived the supervisor to be. The findings suggest that an employee's individual personality is associated with how he or she perceives supervisor behaviours. More specifically, they found that trait negative affect, entitlement, and hostile attribution styles related to the probability of employees perceiving behaviours by their supervisors as abusive. While this may be true, it does not mean that the supervisors were not behaving in an abusive or uncivil manner, it simply means that personality can influence perceptions. Interestingly, while Torkelson et al. (2016) found that being a target of incivility from coworkers was a unique predictor of instigated incivility, they did not find that being a target of supervisor incivility predicted instigated incivility. This finding seems to contradict the findings related to power and incivility discussed next. However, a possible explanation is that the incivility spiral is not present in supervisor-employee interactions because the employee faces greater consequences if they react in an uncivil manner towards their supervisor than towards a co-worker. It has been demonstrated that power and social status are positively related to acts of incivility in the workplace (Estes & Wang, 2008). Although Cortina et al. (2001) were unable to corroborate findings that suggest that individuals in higher positions were more likely to instigate incivility, they do concur that previous trends do support this idea. According to Estes and Wang
 10



(2008), incivility runs in a top down manner; those individuals who have power within the organization often have a corrupting effect on interpersonal norms. Status differentials can result in the more powerful demeaning, degrading or taking advantage of those with less power. Corroborating this in their research, Pearson and Porath (2005) have found evidence leading them to contend that compared to the less powerful, there are more ways for those with greater power to act uncivilly and get away with it. For example, it appears that those with greater power disrupt meetings, make others wait for them, and speak in a condescending manner, with no apparent ramifications. Micro Level of Analysis The last category of incivility antecedents has been labeled "micro" and this category contains antecedent factors that are at the individual level. This category includes 1) job demands and resources, including emotional exhaustion, cognitive overload, psychological contract breach, time pressure, sense of autonomy, and stress; 2) dispositional factors including gender, age, and trait negative affect, and 3) need fulfillment and motivation. In this section I will give an overview of potential theories as alternate models to social exchange theory (SET) for understanding micro level incivility antecedents, and I will discuss how each of these antecedents influence both incivility itself and incivility-related constructs such as mistreatment, bullying, and disrespectful inquiry. 1) Job Demands-Resources and Incivility While social exchange theory is focused on relationships and reciprocity (Sakurai & Jex, 2012), as described in the meso factors section, incivility can also be explored based on individual level antecedents. Therefore, it is my belief that job demands-resources or selfdetermination perspectives are better suited for considering the relationship between incivility and micro factors. First, I will discuss the Job Demands-Resources model and will discuss SelfDetermination theory in a later section. The job-demands resource model of burnout assesses how the characteristics of a job and burnout are able to explain some of the variance in both inrole and extra-role performance (Bakker, Demerouti, & Verbeke, 2004). In-role performance is defined as "those officially required outcomes and behaviours that directly serve the goals of the
 11



organizations" (p.85) whereas extra-role performance is defined as "discretionary behaviours on the part of an employee that are believed to directly promote the effective functioning of an organization, without necessarily directly influencing a person's target productivity" (p.85). Regardless of what the job is, all jobs have characteristics that can be categorized as either job demands or job resources (Bakker et al., 2004). Job demands are considered as aspects of the job that are social, psychological, physical, or organizational (including time pressure), which require sustained psychological and/or physical effort (Bakker et al., 2004; Kühnel, Sonnentag & Bledow, 2011; Vantilborgh, Bidee, Pepermans, Griep, and Hofmans, 2016). Job resources (e.g. social support, autonomy) on the other hand, are physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects of the job (Vantilborgh, 2016). They have three characteristics: 1) they are useful to the individual in accomplishing work goals; 2) they decrease job demands as well as the physiological and psychological costs related to them; and 3) job resources encourage personal learning, growth, and development (Vantilborgh, 2016). Typically, job demands and job resources are negatively correlated, such that high job resources may decrease job demands. The JDR model also proposes that when job demands are high, the individual's energy levels are depleted and because of the effort that must be sustained, health problems ensue and job performance decreases. However, when job resources are increasingly available, it leads to greater levels of work engagement, lower levels of cynicism, and increased job performance (Bakker et al., 2004). Emotional exhaustion, also referred to as burnout, occurs when job demands exceed job resources and it has consistently been found to be positively related to acts of instigated incivility (Blau & Andersson, 2005; Johnson & Indvik, 2001). If an individual is emotionally exhausted it is plausible that he/she will not have the necessary resources needed to engage in a civil manner, specifically when it comes to helping others (Patterson, 2016). In addition, individuals may have feelings of injustice due to the stress, exhaustion or burnout and might intentionally engage in uncivil behaviours as a way of restoring justice. Conversely, employees who are burnt out or have trait negative affect may unintentionally engage in incivility due to reduced attention being given to organizational norms or a reduction in energy levels resulting in less engagement with their coworkers (Patterson, 2016). Cognitive load may also be an antecedent of incivility. According to de Jong (2010), cognitive load is the extent to which cognitive capacity is limited within an individual's working



12



memory; if a task requires too much capacity, it can be considered high cognitive load, or cognitive overload. Further, the capacity of working memory has impacts on cognitive functioning (de Jong, 2010). Fonseca, Brauer, Moisuc, and Nugier (2013) conducted a study to determine how cognitive load effects people's reactions to witnessed deviance. They found that participants with high cognitive load were more likely to experience strong hostile emotions as compared to those in the control condition. Additionally, their results suggest that when cognitive load was increased, the participant's likelihood of demonstrating ineffective social control increased as well. Thus, if these individuals are demonstrating ineffective social control then it can be assumed that they will be more likely to act uncivilly. Furthermore, if these individuals are demonstrating ineffective social control from simply witnessing public deviance, it can also be assumed that when they are the target of deviant uncivil acts, they will react with even less effective forms of social control, including incivility. 2) Dispositional Factors and Incivility A second type of micro antecedent of incivility is dispositional factors. Dispositional factors include age and gender, as well as trait negative affect. More specifically, younger employees have reported more instigated incivility in comparison to older employees. Additionally, men are more likely to instigate incivility compared to women, particularly when the target is someone of a lower status (Jex, Burnfield Geimer, Clark, Guidroz, & Yugo, 2010). Furthermore, an individual's trait negative affect, which is a fairly unchanging disposition that predisposes individuals to negative feelings and emotions, including anger and distress (Patterson, 2016), is related to instigated incivility (Johnson & Indvik, 2001; Reio & Ghosh, 2009), such that higher levels of negative affect are related to high levels of instigated incivility. More specifically, results from Patterson's (2016) study suggest that variance in instigated incivility is explained the most (37%) by trait negative affect. Trait positive affect, on the contrary, which predisposes individuals to positive feelings and emotions, was found to be a significant predictor of increased enacted civility. From this, it can be suggested that individuals with high positive trait positive affect would be less likely to instigate incivility compared to those with low trait positive affect or high trait negative affect. Additionally, a negative relationship was found between enacted civility and enacted incivility (Patterson, 2016).

3) Need Fulfillment (Motivation) and Incivility While the Job Demands-Resources model appeared to explain many of the micro level factors of incivility well, it has come to my attention that the model itself does not account for non-dispositional factors or need fulfillment when considering the relationship between job demands and incivility. In contrast, Self-Determination Theory (SDT) is a theory of motivation that embraces the opinion that all humans have basic psychological needs (Van Quaquebeke & Felps, 2016). SDT is a continuum, whereby it ranges from amotivation, which fully lacks selfdetermination, to intrinsic motivation, which is constant, unwavering self-determination (Gagné & Deci, 2005). It also differentiates between autonomous motivation, which includes intrinsic motivation, and controlled motivation, including externally regulated motivation (Gagné & Deci, 2005). Internal motivation as defined by Deci, Connell, and Ryan (1989), is when an individual is motivated in performing a task due to the task itself, and the gratification and pleasure that is inherent in performing the task. While SDT is a broad theory, it has sub-theories, one of which I will focus on more specifically. This sub theory emphasizes three basic psychological needs, which are innate to individuals and universal across all individuals. According to this sub-theory of SDT, an individual's internal motivation concerning a particular task depends on the degree to which the environment permits feelings of autonomy, relatedness, and competence in the individual (Vallerand et al., 2008); and though it is suggested that all humans share the same set of needs, the fulfillment of each individual's needs is subjective. Further, the consequences of the strength of each need for individual people are not at the center of this theory, instead it is focused on the consequences of the degree to which individual people, within social environments, are able to satisfy these needs (Gagné & Deci, 2005). An individual's need for autonomy represents their need for control. Being pressured for time illustrates an example of an individual's sense of autonomy being decreased. For an individual with a high need for autonomy, this decreased sense of autonomy caused by time pressure would motivate them to gain control in any way possible. It has been proposed that incivility may be one method for gaining back this control (Jex et al., 2010). It is believed that the need for autonomy is the underlying motivation for incivility and that time pressure hinders an individual's sense of autonomy; this in turn motivates an individual
14





to act in an uncivil manner. To further explore this possibility, the following chapter offers a review of the past literature on the more specific construct of time pressure and its' direct and indirect relationship to incivility. Additionally, the possible role of SDT, and in particular the role of autonomy, in explaining these relationships will be considered.

Chapter 3: Literature Review of Time pressure as an Antecedent of Incivility According to Jex et al. (2010) minimal research considers the relationship specifically between incivility and autonomy; however, the current study suggests that when an individual's sense of autonomy is hindered, acts of incivility will increase. Job autonomy, as defined by Hackman and Oldham (1975) is the "degree to which the job provides substantial freedom, independence, and discretion to the employee in scheduling the work and in determining the procedures to be used in carrying it out" (p.162). When these are the outcomes, individuals are likely to have a perceived sense of autonomy. This often involves believing that they are part of the decision-making process and feel as though they have some control and freedom (Hackman & Oldham, 1975). By providing choice to employees and recognizing their experiences and experience level, an internal locus of causality can be stimulated, which ultimately increases internal motivation and enhances the individual's confidence in his or her own performance (Deci & Ryan, 2000). Conversely, threats to autonomy decrease intrinsic motivation and problem-solving skills. The need for autonomy represents the psychological need to experience self-determination and endorse the cause of a particular behaviour as one's own (Cerasoli et al., 2016) and the intrinsic motivation to engage in a specific task diminishes when an individual is forced or manipulated to engage in it. Sense of autonomy is highly dependent upon experiences of stress or time pressure defined as "the state of being compressed" (Orfus, 2008). While there have been a number of speculations regarding the role of stressful working conditions and overwhelming job demands (e.g. time pressure) on incivility, the majority of these studies lack empirical evidence (Roberts, Scherer & Boyer, 2011). Below I will discuss a number of factors that affect an individual's sense of autonomy. These include job demands, mental strain, control, passion for work, organizational climate, leadership styles, and time pressure. As done in the previous section, the current section will be divided into meso and micro level factors with some studies overlapping into multiple levels (macro, meso, or micro).



16



Meso Level Antecedents It has been suggested that employees use uncivil behaviours as a way to gain control of a situation that has become stressful (Jex et al., 2010); similarly, it has been demonstrated that deviant behaviour has often been used in an effort to increase the level of control one has over their work (Analoui & Kakabadse, 1992). Van Quaquebeke and Felps (2016) consider another facet of leader-member relationships and communication in a theoretical paper they wrote on respectful inquiry, which is the motivational power that results from asking open questions and listening to people. They argue that sense of autonomy is related to respectful inquiry such that simply asking their followers how it's going or what they think about something, they give control of the conversation over to the follower, and signal that they accept the followers' autonomy. Additionally, they suggest that by leaders asking questions or allowing the followers to ask questions, it allows the follower to consider, make sense of, and understand, the situation from his or her own perspective, as opposed to being told what is going on from their leader's perspective. The authors consider this a dichotomy between having the freedom to "make sense" versus being "given sense" of a situation. They suggest that time pressure decreases an individual's likelihood of engaging in respectful inquiry because time pressures results in less attention given to followers, less adaptive interactions, and less perspective taking (Van Quaquebeke & Felps, 2016). If time pressure does in fact impact an individual's sense of autonomy, as suggested by Van Quaquebeke and Felps (2016), and sense of autonomy impacts respectful inquiry, then given the relationship between respectful inquiry and incivility, it can be predicted that feelings of time pressure will effect sense of autonomy which would then impact incivility. Micro Level Antecedents A study by Birkeland and Nerstad (2016) combined both macro and micro factors in considering the effect that work internalization, or passion, had on instances of incivility. The definition that they used for passion for work was "a strong inclination toward an activity that people like, that they find important, that is self-defining, and in which they invest time and energy" (p.77). The authors suggest that the way in which an individual internalizes his or her work could impact their moral behaviour. They hypothesized that an individual's obsessive
17





passion for work would result in increased instigated incivility. Not only did they find a stable relationship between these two constructs over time, they also found that when employees worked in organizations that had high levels of mastery climate, this relationship was stronger. Further, Birkeland and Nerstad (2016) argue that certain passions, those that an individual would consider part of their identity, would be related to an increase in uncivil behaviour, if the individual's identity related to the passion was being threatened. This suggests that if an individual was passionate about their work to the extent that they consider it a part of their identity, then having low autonomy could threaten the individual's self-esteem and feelings of prestige. With this in mind, I therefore believe that acts of incivility will be greater, when perceived sense of autonomy is low. This is because less autonomy would likely threaten the employee's identity and other's perceptions of it, as well as their sense of capability, respect, and self-esteem. Those with high obsessive passion rely more heavily on their contingent selfesteem; to this effect, they are likely to also put more effort into proving and validating their competence and status to their coworkers. This lends the potential for them to lash out and do whatever they feel is necessary to save it. When individuals are put under time pressure it can be overwhelming. In situations such as this, the individual's amygdala, a small structure in the brain that is involved in emotional responses and protection from physical or psychological threats, can be hijacked (Kahnen, Gerard, Qin, 2016). These hijacking events occur as a means of protecting the individual in times when rational thinking and actions are required immediately, but when he/she is faced with an insufficient amount of time to do so. In these scenarios, the fight, flight, or freeze response is activated, and problem solving and higher-level thinking are inhibited (Kahnen, Gerard, Qin, 2016). When an individual's problem solving ability or his/her ability for higher-level thinking is inhibited, it is likely that the ability to act civilly is also hindered. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that time pressure correlates with cognitive irritation and emotional irritation (Höge, 2009). We assume that with the inability to perform higher-level thinking and problem solving, as well as being irritated, cognitively or emotionally, acts of incivility will occur. Some factors overlap into multiple different levels of incivility; psychological contract breach is one of these factors. Incivility occurs when norms for mutual respect in interpersonal relations are violated (Andersson & Pearson, 1999). As discussed earlier in the context of the
 18



macro level of analysis of incivility antecedents, these norms or exchanges do not only exist between individuals, but also between an individual and the organization. When these norms are set in place, a psychological contract is created. Estes and Wang consider a psychological contract a "set of unwritten expectations in a relationship" (2008). It is important to note that the parties involved may not share the same views of the contracts' content. Nevertheless, a perceived psychological breach, by either party is possible, and this breach could be considered incivility in the eyes of the target. According to Vantilborgh et al. (2016), perceived psychological contract breaches could be impacted by job demands. Therefore, psychological contract breach could actually fall into any of the three factor categories, macro, meso, or micro. In their studies, Vantilborgh et al. (2016) had participants fill out questionnaires, which included items from the Questionnaire on the Experience and Assessment of Work to measure cognitive load, workload, and autonomy. Using a 4-point Likert scale, sample items for workload and autonomy include: "During the past week, I had to work fast" and "During the past week, I could decide on my own how my work is executed", respectively. In their second study, the findings suggested that job demands were positively related to negative affect and negative affect was positively related to psychological contract breach. Therefore, this demonstrates that high job demands, which immediately result in negative affect, will together cause greater perceptions of psychological contract breach. They then considered the same variables, with time-lagged relationships finding that high levels of job demands were positively related to negative affect the following week. However, negative affect in the current week was not found significantly related to psychological contract breach the following week, suggesting that negative affect may not last long, but rather has more immediate impacts. Further, they tested specific job demands (cognitive load and work load) and specific job resources (autonomy and social support) to determine if the effects that they had on perceptions of job breach, mediated by positive or negative affect, were similar or distinct. Their findings suggest that there was a significant relationship between both workload and cognitive load in the present week with negative affect the following week. Perhaps then, certain job demands cause longer lasting negative affect than job demands more generally. Autonomy in the present week was not found related to positive affect the following week. This may suggest that while negative effects of workload and cognitive load are felt still a week after experiencing the demands, the positive effects of being autonomous are short term. This could imply that for autonomy to have positive impacts, it
19





needs to be ongoing. Since psychological contract breach has been found to relate to acts of incivility, the importance of job demands and sense of autonomy can be hypothesized as antecedents to incivility.  Combining both meso and micro factors, Van Quaquebeke and Felps (2016) consider time pressure a threat to a leader's need for autonomy, as it results in reduced feelings of control. They propose that time pressure reduces the internal, autonomous motivation of a task, as it constrains the freedom of the individual to work as he/she wishes and at his or her own pace. Furthermore, it has been suggested that when individuals are preoccupied with time constraints they may become too focused on finishing their work or task in the required time period, rather than focusing on doing the task well. This may lead to serious effects on the individual's judgment, decisions and actions (de Bilde, Vansteenkiste, & Lens, 2010). Although individuals' internal motivation to accomplish the task well may diminish due to the lack of perceived autonomy, they are nonetheless required, and therefore either externally motivated or unmotivated all together, to accomplish the task; this may ultimately, and perhaps unintentionally, influence them to behave uncivilly in the process of getting the work done. Interestingly, while Van Quaquebeke and Felps (2016), suggest that time pressure may negatively impact sense of autonomy, the opposite has been proposed, such that higher levels of sense of autonomy may improve the ability to cope with job demands (time pressure) and have less mental strain. Mental strain was conceptualized, for example, as role overload or when work expectations surpass the time and resources that are available, or exceed the employees' personal abilities (Jensen, Patel, & Messersmith, 2013). Further, a study by Van Yperen, Wörtler, and De Jonge (2016) tested the conditions under which work overload or work pressure may or may not undermine an employee's intrinsic motivation. They found that when high job demands were combined with a high need for autonomy as well as a lack of perceived opportunities for blended working (ability to determine working hours and location) intrinsic motivation at work was undermined. This particular study used an 11-item measure of quantitative job demands. The items consider the amount of work an employee has to do, how much time they have to do it, and the extent to which they are required to work fast and hard; responses were assessed using a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 4 (always). The average scores on each item formed an overall score; higher overall scores represent higher



20



perceived job demands. Need for autonomy was measured using Van Yperen et al.'s (2014) 4item scale. The authors developed a measure to assess perceived opportunity for blended working; an example of an item on this scale is "The nature of my job is well-suited to timeindependent working". Lastly, they measured intrinsic motivation at work using an adjusted version of Vallerand's (1997) 12-item Intrinsic Motivation Scale, which measured three kinds of intrinsic motivation: motivation to know, to accomplish things, and to experience stimulation. More specifically, the findings of this study suggest that when those who had a high need for autonomy also felt that they had more freedom, given opportunities to choose when and where to work, increasing job demands did not have a negative impact on their intrinsic motivation. Thus, this demonstrates that for those with a high need for autonomy, when given opportunities for decision-making and some control, they are less likely to be overwhelmed and negatively affected by high job demands; this opportunity for control, and in turn high levels of autonomy, may actually help employees cope with their increasing job demands. Conversely, when individuals who have a high need for autonomy are given little autonomy and high job demands, then intrinsic motivation is challenged. Based on these previous studies, the current study will further explore sense of autonomy to offer a motivational account of incivility's antecedents within workplaces. There are three studies that specifically consider time pressure as an antecedent of incivility. First, using data collected through numerous interviews, workshops, and questionnaires, it was uncovered that employees claimed not to have the time for the "polite, `niceties' of business life" because of information and work overload and work and personal life commitments (Pearson et al. 2000, p. 128). Corroborating this, a more recent study found that time-pressure caused by personal life encroaching on work life predicted uncivil acts towards coworkers (Chris, 2014). This study measured time-based work-personal life conflict using two 3-item subscales created by Calson, Kacmar and Williams (2000), modified to assess workpersonal life conflict, in contrast to work-family conflict. One scale measured time-based workto-personal life conflict (TWIP) and the second, more aligned with the current research, measured `time-based personal-to-work life conflict' (TPIW). An example item assessing the latter is "Today, the time I am spending on personal responsibilities is interfering with my work responsibilities". Responses were based on a 7-point Likert scale from "1" (strongly disagree) to



21



"7" (strongly agree). Enacted incivility (known throughout this paper as targeted incivility), was measured using the Straightforward Incivility Scale by Leiter, Day and Laschinger (2013). Participants were given two versions of the scale, differing only in the instructions: one version was used to measure the frequency of enacted incivility towards coworkers, while the second was used to measure the frequency of enacted incivility towards patients (participants worked in nursing homes across the GTA). Both of these studies highlight that when individuals feel time pressure to get their work done, since their time to do work is constrained, they will be more likely to act uncivilly. Pearson and Porath (2004) surveyed individuals and found that 40% conceded to the idea that civility was too time consuming, and time pressure powered their uncivil acts. The research methods used for all of these studies were qualitative, using combinations of self-report type methods including daily-diary studies and survey studies, as well as focus groups, and interviews. The overarching construct of "job demands", which includes time pressure, has been found to relate to incivility (Fonseca, Brauer, Moisuc & Nugier, 2013; Torkelson et al., 2016). Torkelson et al. (2016) found that when an employee had recently been exposed to high job demands, workplace incivility was more frequently reported. To measure job demands, they used the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ II) (Pejtersen, Kristensen, Borg, & Bjorner, 2010) in a Swedish version (National Research Centre for the Working Environment, 2014). Specifically, they used a four-item subscale. A sample item is "Is your workload unevenly distributed so it piles up?" Response alternatives ranged from "0" (never/hardly ever) to "4" (always). Together high job demands, combined with job insecurity, low social support from coworkers and organizational change accounted for 13.7% of the variance in the covert instigated incivility variable, suggesting that a combination of macro, meso, and micro level antecedents are at play in causing incivility. Different sources of stress emerging from one's workplace are related to greater enacted mistreatment towards other individuals. Specifically, these factors include situational constraints, such as a lack of resources (Hershcovis, Turner, Barling, Arnold, Dupré, Inness, LeBlanc, & Sivanathan, 2007), as well as role overload and high workload (Francis, Holmvall, & O'Brien, 2015; Holmvall & Damp, 2016). Francis et al. (2015) studied the impact that workload has on



22



incivility in a way that can be considered a measure of time pressure. They manipulated workload by giving the participants a particular number of tasks to complete during a 30-minute time period. Those in the low workload condition were given two tasks while those in the high workload condition were given the same two tasks as the low workload condition, with the addition of three other tasks, to also be completed in 30 minutes. Once the 30 minutes were up, participants in both conditions completed a questionnaire, which evaluated their self-rated performance on, as well as their perceptions of each of the tasks. Embedded within the tasks for each condition was responding to one civil and one uncivil stimulus email message from subordinates. The incivility levels of their responses were assessed by both third party raters and as self-assessments. First, a third-party rater assessed the emails by completing the 5-item objective elements of email incivility scale, created for this study (1= very uncivil, 5= very civil, though responses were reverse coded); raters were blind to the condition of email the participants were responding to (i.e. civil or uncivil emails). It is interesting to note that this study is one of few studies found in the literature review that used a third party rater to rate incivility. They rated the incivility level based on the violations of email etiquette they described in their study, some of which included punctuation, clarity or introduction of the message. Second, participants completed a 7-item self-report incivility scale. An example question is "To what extent do you think this email was rude"; responses ranged from "1"= to a small extent to "5"= to a large extent. It was discovered that workload impacted the level of incivility in the response emails, both when rated by third parties and through self-assessment. Additionally, and in line with the incivility spiral (Andersson & Pearson, 1999), participants displayed greater incivility when responding to the uncivil emails compared to the civil emails. Based on this study, I hypothesize that time pressure as a measure itself, would find similar results. There is a widely held belief that workplace bullying can be a result of a stressful work environment (Baillien, De Cuyper & De Witte, 2011). Baillien et al. (2011) suggest that job characteristics including workload and job autonomy act as antecedents to bullying. This study was a longitudinal study, with a 6-month lag, whereby workload was measured using four items from Van Veldhoven and Meijman (1994). Responding on a four-point Likert scale, sample questions included `Do you work under time pressure?' and `Do you have to work fast?' Job autonomy was measured using five items, also with a 4-point Likert scale, and these included



23



statements such as `I can chose my own assignments' and `I can plan my own work'. They found a significant time-1 interaction effect between workload and job autonomy relative to being a perpetrator of bullying at time-2. Put differently, bullying is more likely to occur when the instigator has a high workload and low job autonomy. This can be a stressful situation, whereby the instigator may counter their negative emotions by lashing out at a co-worker. They recommend that organizations encourage and invest in job autonomy as well avoid and neutralize high-strain jobs. Sense of autonomy is central to Self Determination Theory that is appropriate for investigating the current research question for two reasons: first, my research question considers incivility in the workplace. Since work is a type of social environment in which many individuals spend the majority of their waking hours, it should be no surprise that stressors and resources apparent in the workplace will have significant impacts on the psychological needs of individuals (Van Quaquebeke & Felps, 2016). Secondly, my research question considers antecedents of incivility while also taking into account individual need fulfillment. Additionally, use of SDT does not appear to be widespread in the incivility literature; however, it is one of the most extensively used theories in reference to human motivation and function and has been used in a diverse range of fields including physical activity, education, parenting, work, and health, to name a few (Ryan & Deci, 2000; Vallerand, Koestner & Pelletier, 2008).

Chapter 4: Research Questions and Hypotheses Research Questions/Objectives 1. Will time pressure impact a manager's incivility (belittling or ignoring the employee, making rude remarks, etc.)? 2. Will a manager's sense of autonomy affect their incivility? 3. Will time pressure impact the amount and/or type of questions asked by the manager? 4. Will an employee be less uncivil if it appears that their manager cares about their concerns (ie. by asking the employee open questions) Hypotheses The current study uses a deductive approach as it uses the general theory of selfdetermination as well as Job-Demands Resources Theory to explain the specific relationships between time pressure and sense of autonomy on incivility and respectful inquiry. This study presents several hypotheses: Hypothesis 1a. Time pressure will be positively related to manager incivility. Hypothesis 1b. Managers in the time pressure condition will interrupt more than managers in the no time pressure condition. Hypothesis 2. Employee incivility will be positively related to manager incivility, such that as manager incivility increases so will employee incivility. Hypothesis 3a. Managers who are put under time pressure will ask fewer questions Hypothesis 3b. Managers who are put under time pressure will ask fewer open questions than closed questions Hypothesis 4. Employees who are asked more questions will be less uncivil Figure 4.1 Hypotheses 1a, 1b
 Time Pressure Incivility 25





These hypotheses suggest that mangers in the time pressure condition will, behave uncivilly more than those in the no time pressure condition. More specifically, we hypothesize that managers who are under time pressure will interrupt their employees at a higher frequency than if they are not under time pressure. These hypotheses are based on previous research, which suggests that stressors emerging from one's workplace are related to greater mistreatment towards other individuals, more specifically these factors include situational constraints, such as a lack of resources (Hershcovis et al., 2007). Time can be considered a resource, and therefore when time pressure is increased the resource is diminished, and it is believed that this will increase workplace incivility, as it is a related construct of mistreatment. Figure 4.2 Hypothesis 2. Employee incivility will be positively related to Manager incivility, such that manager as incivility increases, so will employee incivility and vice versa.

Manager Incivility

Employee Incivility

As previously mentioned, the spiral effect of incivility was noted first by Andersson and Pearson in 1999. It is hypothesized that as the amount of uncivil behaviour perpetrated by the manager increases, so too will the amount of uncivil behaviour by the employee. This concept has been examined in a number of studies (Pearson & Porath, 2005; Torkelson et al., 2016; Van Jaarsveld et al., 2010), using a number of different methods including surveys (Van Jaarseveld et al., 2010), field studies (Pearson & Porath, 2005) and experiments (Francis et al., 2015). The current study allows further exploration into the incivility spiral by providing a controlled experimental setting that considers the combination of face-to-face interactions with time pressure, and hypothesizes that increased incivility from one party (the manager) will increase the incivility perpetrated by the second party (employee). Figure 4.3

Hypotheses3a and 3b

Time Pressure

Questions

These hypotheses came out of the respectful inquiry literature. While managers are often operating under time pressure, the time that they are able to put into supervising, guiding and monitoring employees becomes more limited as deadlines approach (Van Quaquebeke & Felps, 2016). According to Smeltzer and Fann (1989), managers listed time pressure as one of the main factors hindering their ability to communicate with their employees as much as they would like to. Making direct statements, rather than asking employees questions or asking for their thoughts or opinions may be thought of by managers as a way to save time (Van Quaquebeke & Felps, 2016), but may result in employees feeling overlooked and devalued. Figure 4.4 Hypothesis 4. Employees who are asked more questions will be less uncivil

Open Questions

Employee Incivility

This hypothesis was derived from the respectful inquiry literature. According to Van Quaquebeke and Felps (2016), many practitioners have pointed out the powerful and effective leadership technique of asking subordinates or followers open questions and attentively listening to their responses. This combination of asking open questions and listening attentively to the responses has been termed as respectful inquiry (Van Quaquebeke & Felps, 2016). It is believed that in conversations where managers ask more questions, specifically open questions, there will be less incivility. This is because asking open questions is an invitation for the employee to express their thoughts in a manner that they feel is appropriate, without restricting their responses to simply agreement or disagreement. It is suggested that this conveys the belief that
 27



the manager views the employee as equal, and as having dignity (Van Quaquebeke, Henrich, & Eckloff, 2007), or in other words, this signifies respect. As demonstrated throughout this paper and past literature, incivility is the violation of workplace norms for mutual respect, thus, by offering signals of respect towards employees, it is hypothesized that the employee will be less uncivil, and in addition, if the manager is being respectful in asking open questions, it is likely that they will not be disrespectful in other aspects of the performance appraisal.

Chapter 5: Methodology Background Social psychology and organizational sciences have differences in their tendencies for using certain methodologies: For example, where research in the field of social psychology is dominated with lab experiments, organizational research typically uses surveys (Cortina, 2008). Cortina (2008) suggests that workplace incivility research should instead be studied using different methodologies, such as with lab experiments in order to expand incivility research down thought-provoking and exciting new paths. Also with a few notable exceptions (i.e. Francis et al, 2015), the majority of incivility research is either focused on the perspective of the one experiencing it (Cortina et al., 2001; Pearson et al., 2000; Lim et al., 2008), or from the perspective on the individual instigating it (Blau & Andersson, 2005; Birkeland & Nerstad, 2016; Liu et al., 2009; Reio & Ghosh, 2009.) When considering incivility from either perspective, measures have predominantly been retrospective and self-report. Some of the commonly used self-report scales include: Cortina et al.'s (2001) Workplace Incivility Scale, Blau and Andersson's (2005) Instigated Workplace Incivility Scale and Martin and Hine's (2005) Uncivil Workplace Behaviour Questionnaire (Kunkel, et al., 2015). While self-report measures have the potential to provide strong data, they also have the potential to be biased due to social desirability. From a victim's perspective, they may either over-estimate their run-ins with incivility with the hope of having issues dealt with, or they may under-estimate it, potentially as a result of feeling weak for admitting that is has happened. Additionally, from the instigators' perspectives, their uncivil behaviours, and their consequences, are viewed differently from how the victim would view them. Instigators likely do not want to admit if they have been uncivil, and they can often justify their behaviours to make themselves believe they were not being uncivil at all (Chris, 2014). If individuals can justify their actions as not being uncivil and the social desirability is too strong, then self-report measures may not be accurate for the realm of incivility. Additional disadvantages of self-report measures are: they rely on the recall of uncivil behaviours in contrast to the actual behaviours (Robinson & Clore, 2002) therefore reducing the validity of the results; they lack the elements of random assignment and control groups, and, what is essential for the current study, they lack the measurement of presumed causes before presumed effects. This last element makes it challenging, if not impossible, to
 29



make credible inferences about cause and effect. Interestingly, the use of third-party raters of incivility, who are blind to the condition, eliminates this bias (Francis et al, 2015). However, because individuals feel things differently, a third-party rater may overlook a behaviour that could be viewed as uncivil by the victim, or may view behaviour as uncivil when the instigator may not. Nevertheless third-party ratings of incivility offer greater reliability throughout the study, such that the uncivil behaviours are consistently being measured the same way, from an observational perspective. Furthermore, the use of a third party rater allows for the coding of dyadic interactions, allowing the potential to see the incivility spiral unfold, witnessing how one party's uncivil behaviour impacts the other party's behaviour. For research that seeks to determine causal relationships, experimental designs are the most effective (Birkeland & Nerstad, 2015), as they allow manipulation. Specifically, using an experimental design for the current research allows for the manipulation of the independent variable (time pressure) in order to determine if it causes a change in the presence of the dependent variable (incivility) (Hershcovis, 2011). According to Aguinis and Bradley (2014), literature reviews on management research and related fields have demonstrated and acknowledged the need for research that allows for enhanced knowledge on causal relationships. Additionally, when it comes to internal validity, experimental designs offer high levels of confidence. While there are many benefits to experimental designs, there are also limitations or disadvantages. First, experimental research is not always representative of real-life scenarios: experimental designs are artificially designed; they include the variables under study, but exclude those that are deemed irrelevant, and control those that are unavoidable (Neuman, 2014). Expanding on this, while experimental designs focus heavily on ensuring internal validity, they may result in a lack of external validity. Furthermore, one of the goals of experimental designs is to be able to generalize the results as broadly as possible. A drawback of this goal is that it can cause temptation in the researcher to manipulate multiple features simultaneously, to save both money and time, which ultimately makes it harder to determine the cause (Kachelmeier & Towry, 2004). Experimental designs are also limited in the types of questions that they ask; certain aspects of the human life cannot ethically be manipulated, and all research involving humans must meet ethical standards (Neuman, 2014). Despite these disadvantages and limitations, experimental designs remain the best option for determining causal relationships



30



(Neuman, 2014), and this is why this design has been chosen to study the role of time pressure in causing increased incivility. The incivility literature discusses incivility concerning three different relationships: supervisor-subordinate (Cortina et al., 2001; Estes & Wang, 2008; Pearson & Porath, 2005), coworker-coworker (Holm et al., 2015; Hur et al., 2015; Sakurai & Jex, 2012; Torkelson et al., 2016), and employee-customer (Van Jaarsveld et al., 2010). While each type of relationship is important in regards to incivility, and has different consequences, they all ultimately impact the organization as a whole. Based on my extensive literature review, much of the literature has been concerned with coworker-coworker incivility (Sakurai & Jex, 2012; Torkelson et al., 2016). However, what I found interesting was that not only were there fewer studies done concerning supervisor-subordinate incivility, these few studies had inconsistencies in their findings, as discussed in Chapter 3. Because of this, I felt that this type of incivility could be explored further and another goal of this research is to assist with providing clarity around incivility trends in power-imbalanced workplace relationships. Study 1: Pilot Participants Participants were undergraduate marketing students from Ryerson University. They were recruited using the Ryerson University Student Subject Pool. An ad was posted on the database (see Appendix A), and students had the opportunity to sign up for a time slot. The sessions lasted one hour each, and participants were awarded 1% to their final grade in the course associated with the participant pool. Sixteen participants signed up, however only 11 showed up for their sessions. Nine of the participants were female and two were male. Seven of the participants were in second year, three were in third year, and one was in fourth year. Three of the participants were 18-19 years old; seven were 20-22 years old; and one was 23 years old or older. This study received ethics approval from Ryerson's Research Ethics Board. Procedure As with any experiment, there is always the question of whether or not the experimental context reflects reality, and if the context was appropriate for the given study. For this particular



31



study, a mock performance appraisal was determined to be a suitable setting. The performance appraisal had both positive and negative grades and comments regarding the employee, and it was designed to have several discrepancies between the manager's appraisal and the employee's self-appraisal. Additionally, it offered a supervisor-employee power imbalance. With incivility as the focus of my study, it was essential to create a scenario that had the potential for incivility, and the above characteristics were believed to do that. The students played the role of the manager in the scenario. The employee was an actor trained through Ryerson's Interpersonal Skills Teaching Center, and the participants knew that the `employee' was an actor. The sessions took place in a private room on the Ryerson University campus. Upon arrival, participants read and signed a consent form (see Appendix B), filled out a brief demographic survey (see Appendix C), and were given time to review the completed performance appraisal form. The participants were given one of three versions of a completed performance appraisal of the employee (Version A: no time pressure, Version B: psychological time pressure, and Version C: actual time pressure) (see Appendices D-F); the employee was also given a copy of this performance appraisal with the addition of their self-assigned performance scores (see Appendix F). The manager's task was to discuss the appraisal with the employee, share their ratings, and together create an action plan. There were three time pressure conditions in the pilot: a) no time pressure (on their performance appraisal form, participants were told that the meeting should last 30 minutes), and b) psychological time pressure (on their performance appraisal form they were told that the meeting should only last 30 minutes but it might not be enough) and c) time pressure (on their performance appraisal form, participants were told that they had 45 minutes, however just before starting the meeting they were told that due to scheduling issues, they now only had 30 minutes). Each participant was randomly assigned to only one time pressure condition. The confederate (employee) was blind to the condition. All interactions were video recorded. After the performance appraisal, participants completed a post-appraisal survey (see Appendix H). This survey included several scales. The first question asked if the participant felt under time pressure (this was used as the time pressure manipulation check). It also included



32



modified versions of multiple Workplace Incivility Scales (Cortina et al., 2001; Blau & Andersson, 2005; Martin & Hine, 2005) and some items from an SDT survey from Van den Broeck, Vansteenkiste, De Witte, Soenens & Lens (2010) were used to measure the participant's need for autonomy. Lastly, to control for trait negative affect and trait positive affect, it included the PANAS (Watson, Clark & Tellegen, 1988). To end the session, participants were given a debriefing form (Appendix I) that explained the purpose of the study, the three different conditions, and why it was important that they were unaware of the manipulations. They were asked if they had any questions, and they were offered feedback from the simulator on how she experienced their communication behaviour performance during the role-play. Simulators are trained in how to give constructive feedback. Additionally, after all of the sessions with the participants were completed, each participant received an email with feedback regarding guidelines for effective communication during a performance appraisal (Appendix J). Coding Several coding systems were considered for use in this study, including the System for the Multiple Level Observation of Groups (SYMLOG), the Time-by-Event-by-Member Pattern Observation (TEMPO), the Transactive Knowledge Coding System (TRAWIS), and Discussion Coding System DCS (Schermuly & Scholl, 2012). The DCS initially appeared as the top system. It is a coding instrument used to analyze interactions between two or more people. Along with speech, DCS is able to capture the observable patterns that are present in interactions and visible reactions to direct behaviours (Schermuly & Scholl, 2012). Coding systems are beneficial because they allow behaviour to be analyzed in a straightforward and organized manner (Schermuly & Scholl, 2012). In comparison to the other systems considered, the DCS is faster (Schermuly & Scholl, 2012), which makes it more cost-effective, and with a shorter coding process, it allows greater samples to be to be used in the research. A second reason for using DCS over other systems is that it allows for the coding of non-verbal behaviours (Schermuly & Scholl, 2012). A communication coding system that ignores non-verbal behaviour misses vital elements involved in interactions. Audio recordings are therefore less desirable than video recordings because they do not allow for the analysis of nonverbal behaviours. Lastly, in past
33





studies that have used DCS with multiple coders, inter-rater agreement has been strong after completing training and with the aid of video support (Schermuly & Scholl, 2012). In addition to the using regular DCS factors, we also added a version of the Workplace Incivility Scale (Cortina et al., 2001), which was adapted for use by a third-party observer, rather than the victim or instigator of the uncivil behaviour. Two coders, or third-party observers, coded each of the videos, noting certain behaviours and communication types for both the `listener' and the `speaker'. At the end of each video, the frequencies of each of the behaviours were compiled to provide an overall count for each variable, for example, number of hostile looks. Further, the overall incivility frequency was calculated for each participant by adding together the number of times the individual under observation committed an uncivil act. To convert incivility into a standard rate, the overall incivility frequency was divided by the number of minutes that the performance appraisal lasted. Data Overview Sixteen students signed up to participate in the pilot study; however five did not show up, resulting in eleven participants. Nine of the participants were female and two were male. Of the eleven participants, five were in the `no time pressure' condition, three were in the `time pressure' condition, and three were in the psychological time pressure condition. None of the participants had previous experience conducting a performance appraisal. When asked if the participant felt in control during the appraisal, the mean response was 3.09, where "1" represented `strongly disagree' and "4" represented `strongly agree'. Explorative Analyses First, I conducted a reliability analysis using the single measures intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) to estimate the proportion of variance in the data that was due to differences in the subjects, rather than differences in the raters. From this it was discovered that examples and operational definitions of the incivility terms would be required, as the inter-rater reliability for several of the variables were weak. It was also discovered that the coding system was too time consuming and too broad for this study. Using the DCS, the average coding time for 30 minutes of video was approximately 4 hours (not what was advertised); because of the lengthy coding



34



process, the coders only coded five of the eleven videos within the parameters of their contracts. Because additional budget was not available, it was decided that a new coding system be developed. Rather than waiting until the main study, the researcher coded all 11 videos using the new, more simplified coding system. This new coding system was a modified version of Cortina et al.'s (2001) Instigated Workplace Incivility Scale, which was adapted for use by a third-party observer rather than as a self-report of experienced or instigated incivility. There are a number of scales used to measure incivility (Cortina et al., 2001; Blau & Andersson, 2005; Martin & Hine, 2005). These scales all differ in some ways, though there is a great deal of overlap in the items. Looking at these scales, as well as the DCS, I selected the items that were more likely to come up in a performance appraisal setting. Taking all the items into consideration, the measure used for the current study included 9 incivility items, adapted from these various scales. Please see the modifications presented in Appendix K. The coding system also included the addition of two Respectful Inquiry items. These were Open questions" and "Closed questions". (Items 1-2 in Appendix L) Open questions include questions that are asked that require or encourage elaboration, or more than a `yes' or `no' answer. Conversely, a closed question would encourage a simple `yes' or `no' answer, with no elaboration expected or encouraged. An example of an open question would be: "What do you think about that?", while a closed question would be "Do you like the office?" In the original coding system (the DCS) the coder coded incivility by watching the video twice, once while observing the speaker and once while observing the listener. In the new coding system the coder also coded twice but in this case the first coding round measured manager incivility and the second coding round measured the employee incivility. The purpose of this was to ensure that both non-verbal and verbal behaviours were captured, by coding both parties at the same time, nonverbal behaviours are likely to be missed. Additionally, by implementing these changes, it enabled the incivility spiral to be explored and allowed for a more thorough analysis overall. This was the data used for the subsequent analyses. It should be noted, however, that this coder (the researcher) was aware of the conditions, but was blind to who was in each condition. Means and standard deviations of each of the variables can be seen in Table 5.1.

The data was analyzed in a number of ways: first, to check if the time manipulation worked, I compared the binary measure (Did the participant feel under time pressure, yes or no?) between the conditions. The mean of the measure (no is coded as 0 and yes is coded as 1) was higher in the time pressure condition (m= 0.67) compared to the no time pressure condition (m= 0.20), demonstrating that the manipulation worked. Next, a two-way ANOVA compared the main effects of time condition and sense of autonomy and the interaction effect between them on the frequency of incivility. Time condition included three levels (time pressure, no time pressure, and psychological time pressure) and sense of autonomy consisted of four levels (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree). The main effect for time condition was nonsignificant, yielding an F ratio of F (2, 9) = 1.59, p > .05, indicating that there was not a significant difference in manger incivility levels across the conditions. The main effect for sense of autonomy yielded an F ratio of F (3, 8) = 7.09, p < .05, indicating that the frequency of incivility was significantly different based on the level of autonomy that the manager felt. The
36





interaction effect was non-significant, F (2, 9) = 1.92, p > .05. Since time condition did not have a significant effect on incivility, I then ran a one-way ANOVA to test if the managers perception of being under time pressure impacted their incivility, this too was non-significant, F (1, 10) = 2.77, p = .130, ns. Next, I ran a one-way ANOVA to determine the effect of gender on incivility, the result was non-significant, however the group size were not equal therefore the results are not reliable. Although a number of the findings were non-significant, it was believed that having a larger sample would result in more robust findings. I also conducted a one-way ANOVA to determine if there was a difference between those in the time pressure condition and those in the psychological time pressure condition; it was found that there was no significant difference, F(1)= 1.029, p= .368. Levene's test of homogeneity of variance showed that there was no significant variance, F (1) = 1.538, p = .283. In addition to this, I conducted another one-way ANOVA using only two time conditions (no time pressure and the combined time pressure and psychological time pressure groups) and their relation to overall incivility. The results of this analysis were non-significant, F (1)= 0.78, however it resulted in a slightly lower p value than was found when all three conditions were originally considered. Therefore, it is believed that the psychological time pressure condition can be removed from the main study. Summary This pilot study was insightful and informed a number of changes made to Study 2. For instance, it became apparent that I needed to implement a method for balancing the gender of participants, as only two of the eleven participants were male. Additionally, it became clear that the DCS, while a very strong coding system, took far too long to use and included factors that our coders measured with low inter-rater reliability, and were also not necessarily useful for the purposes of the current research. The new system created allowed me to eliminate many of the aspects of the DCS that were not relevant to my study, and to add in more focused incivility items. This also allowed the removal of conversational segmentation, which also became less necessary as I was not interested in the different functional verbal communication types measured by the DCS (i.e. content, regulation or socio-emotional statements). Rather, I was concerned with the number of uncivil verbal and non-verbal behaviours spanning the entire
37





performance appraisal meeting, and the number of open and closed questions. By eliminating segmentation, it also increased the coding speed. Study 1 also showed a glimpse of the timeconsuming nature of the chosen study method, influencing the removal of the psychological time pressure condition and the shortening of the sessions to 20 minutes each for the main study, thus decreasing the time spent running the sessions and the time spent coding the videos. I also discovered while viewing the video recordings that the camera angles were not always ideal for viewing facial expressions, and this was adjusted for the main study. Study 2: Main Participants For the main study, sixty-two undergraduate marketing students from Ryerson University were recruited using the Ryerson University Student Subject Pool. Two ads were posted on the database (Please see Appendix M and N), and students had the opportunity to sign up for a time slot. The ads differed only in their titles: "A Manager-Employee Performance Appraisal Discussion- only for those who identify as male" and "A Manager-Employee Performance Appraisal Discussion- only for those who identify as female". Posting two separate ads allowed us to control the gender balance, with the goal of 30 males and 30 females. The sessions lasted one hour each, and participants received a bonus mark of 1% to their final grade in the course associated with the participant pool. The Ryerson Research Ethics Board granted approval for this study. Procedure Students signed up with the understanding that they would be involved in a mock performance appraisal; all participants acted as the manager. The employee was an actor trained through Ryerson's Interpersonal Skills Teaching Center, and the participants knew that the `employee' was an actor. The sessions took place in a private room on the Ryerson University campus. Upon arrival, participants read and signed a consent form (see Appendix B) and filled out a brief demographic survey (see Appendix C). They were also given time to review the completed performance appraisal document. The employee was also given a copy of a



38



completed performance appraisal, with differing self-assessed scores and notes (See Appendix G). The manager's task was to review with the employee each category on the performance appraisal, get his/her input, and formulate an action plan for improvement. I manipulated time pressure as follows: a) In the no time pressure condition the instruction on the performance appraisal form (Appendix O), was that the meeting should last 20 minutes and it did. In the time pressure condition, however, the instruction on the performance appraisal form was that they had 30 minutes however just before starting the meeting they were told that due to scheduling issues, they now only had 20 minutes (Appendix P). Additionally, in this condition after 15 minutes, the researcher entered the room to give the participant a 5-minute warning. Since it is a between-subjects design, there were a total of 31 participants in each condition; each participant was randomly assigned to only one time pressure condition. The confederate (employee) was blind to the condition for the first 15 minutes (until the 5-minute warning). After the performance appraisal, participants completed a post-appraisal survey (see Appendix Q) that included several scales. The first question asked if the participant felt under time pressure (this was used as the manipulation check). It also included a modified version of multiple Workplace Incivility Scales (Cortina et al., 2001; Blau & Andersson, 2005; Martin & Hine, 2005), an adapted version of an SDT survey from Van den Broeck, Vansteenkiste, De Witte, Soenens & Lens (2010) to measure the control variable need for autonomy, and 2-items were also used to measure feelings of autonomy during the appraisal. Lastly, to control for both trait negative affect and trait positive affect, it included the 20- item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, also known as PANAS (Watson, Clark & Tellegen, 1988). Need for autonomy was not measured in Study 1, however, it became more evident after further research and study 1, that an individuals need for autonomy would impact their ability to handle time pressure, therefore it was added as a control measure for the main study. This was measured using two questions: "In general, at work or school I have a strong need to feel in control" and "In general, at work or school, I have a strong need for doing things my own way". As previously indicated, it has been found that males, in comparison to females, are more likely to be instigators of incivility (Pearson et al., 2000; Jex, et al., 2010). In addition, it has also been suggested that compared to females, males reported being the victim more of supervisor incivility (Reio, 2011).
39





This tells us that incivility levels, both as a perpetrator and as a victim are impacted by gender. Similarly, a relationship has been found between trait negative affect and increased perceptions of supervisory abuse (Brees et al., 2015), and it has been suggested trait negative affect predisposed individuals' to negative emotions, and is related to instigated incivility (Reio & Ghosh, 2009; Johnson & Indvik, 2001). Furthermore, past research has suggested that trait negative affect explains 37% of the variance in instigated incivility (Patterson, 2016). Based on this evidence, I also decided to control for trait negative affect. Since trait negative affect has been suggested to have significant effects on incivility, I thought it would also be interesting to control for the role of trait positive affect, to glimpse into the impact that it had on incivility. PANAS has 20-items, 10 measuring positive affect and 10 measuring negative affect, allowing both variables to be measured and controlled for. Participants also completed a self-assessment of their own incivility to allow for comparison between self-assessment ratings and third-party ratings. Following the performance appraisal the simulator was also asked to fill out a selfassessment of their own incivility, as well as their experienced incivility during the session (see Appendix R). The report of experienced incivility permitted the exploration and comparison of perceived manager incivility based on reports from the manager, the employee, and the thirdparty rater. To end the session, participants received a debriefing form (see Appendix I) that explained the purpose of the study, the two different conditions, and why it was important that they were unaware of the manipulation. The debriefing form also communicated to the participant that if they were uncomfortable with the nature of the study, they could have their data removed from my study. They were asked if they had any questions, and they were offered feedback from the simulator on how she experienced their communication behaviour performance. Additionally, after all of the sessions with the participants were completed, each participant received an email with feedback regarding guidelines for effective communication during a performance appraisal (see Appendix J). Measures and Coding The performance appraisals were videotaped and two third-party individuals (research assistants) coded observed uncivil behaviour (verbal and nonverbal) as well as the number of
40





open and closed questions. They were blind to the experimental conditions until the last five minutes. The research assistants signed a confidentiality agreement (see Appendix S), which included keeping all aspects related to the participants' identification confidential. The research assistants used the coding sheet (see Appendix T) as a reference for coding uncivil behaviours. The video was coded twice: first the coding focused on the communication behaviours of the manager, and the second time the coding focused on the communication behaviours of the employee. This gave the research a dyadic perspective into communication, and also allowed me to analyze the incivility spiral. Nine incivility items and two respectful inquiry items make up the current coding system. After watching the pilot videos, an additional incivility item was added: `negative tone'. To recap, a new measure was created by adapting former measures: the new scale eliminates social desirability biases by having a third-party rate video interactions rather than a participating party; it removes any recall errors by the participant, as the data is based on a 20 minute video that the third-party rates while watching; and it also includes items related to respectful inquiry. As previously mentioned, need for autonomy was measured using 2 items taken from an adapted version of an SDT survey from Van den Broeck, Vansteenkiste, De Witte, Soenens & Lens (2010). Sense of autonomy was measured using 2 items asking about feelings of control within the performance appraisal, and lastly, trait negative affect and trait positive affect were measured using the 20- item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, also known as PANAS (Watson, Clark & Tellegen, 1988). Ten of the items measure Trait PA and the remaining ten measure Trait NA. Each set of ten scores are added together to get a final Trait PA score and a final Trait NA score.

Chapter 6: Analysis and Results To provide a brief overview of the data, I have compiled correlations for some of the main relationships under consideration. These correlations can be seen in Table 6.1. Table 6.1. Correlations for Main Variables

Notes: **. Correlation is significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed). *. Correlation is significant at the 0.05 level (2-tailed). After going through the data, 4 participants were removed. One was removed due to a recording malfunction, whereby only the first two minutes of the session was recorded. A second video was removed because one of the coders did not have time to code the video while keeping within the hours of their contract. A third video was removed due to missing data. After running some key analyses, an outlier was found in regard to incivility. As demonstrated in the Figure 6.1, where the frequency of uncivil behaviours in each video is represented on the x-axis and the frequency of videos with that amount of incivility on the y-axis, the frequency of manager incivility in one video was much larger than the frequency of manager incivility in the other videos. Therefore this participant was also removed. Thus, 58 participants remained in use for the analyses.

Descriptive Statistics To begin the analyses, I ran some descriptive statistics; these can be seen in Table 6.2. There were two different coders for the study, who each coded 60 of the same videos. There were also two simulators acting as the employee one simulator acted in 22 of the 60 videos, and the other simulator acted in the remaining 38. Of the 58 participants whose data were used for the study, 30 were in the `time pressure' condition and 28 were in the `no time pressure' condition. There were more females than males, (m=1.60, where male=1 and female=2); more specifically, 21 of participants were male, and 37 were female. Fifteen participants were between the ages of 18-19 (represented by `1'); twenty-nine participants were between the ages of 20-22 (represented by `2'), twelve were 23 or older (represented by `3'), and two participants chose not to disclose their age. Of these participants were 3 were in first year (represented by `1'), 21 in second year (represented by `2'), 16 in third year (represented by `3'), 13 in fourth years (represented by `4'), and 5 in fifth year students (represented by `5'). The mean trait



43



positive affect for the participants was m=34.93, with a standard deviation of 6.68. The possible scores on this scale range from 10 to 50, therefore the mean of 34.93 demonstrates slightly more positive affect in our participants than the scale average score on the scale of 33.3. The mean trait negative affect was m=19.88; the possible scores on this scale also range from 10 to 50, and the average of 19.88 represents a slightly higher level of negative affect than the scale average of 17.4. Only two participants had previous experience conducting a performance appraisal (where 1= yes and 2= no). The sense of autonomy during the performance appraisal sessions had a mean of 3.62, where "1" represented feeling less autonomous and "5" represented feeling more autonomous. The participants' general need for autonomy had a mean of 3.35, where "1" represented needing less control and autonomy in their lives and "5" represented needing more control and autonomy in their lives.

Notes: These statistics exclude the outlier Calculating Incivility The frequency of each of the manager's uncivil behaviours was calculated. Specifically, the frequencies of the different uncivil behaviours observed from the manager in the performance appraisals in the time pressure condition were added together to create one overarching incivility variable. This was also done for the observed uncivil employee behaviours The frequencies of uncivil behaviours that were perpetrated by the managers in the no time pressure condition were added together as well for each manager, as will be done for those behaviours perpetrated by each employee in this condition. The total frequency of uncivil behaviours were divided by the total length of each session in order to come up with an `incivility rate' for each party. The incivility rates of both conditions were then compared. This method assumes that each of the uncivil behaviours has an equal impact. Inter-Rater Reliability I computed the intraclass correlations (ICC) as estimates of inter-rater reliability between two raters on each of the uncivil behaviours being measured. Inter-rater reliability evaluates the consistency of the rating system (Francis et al., 2015). ICC estimates and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated using SPSS statistical package version 24 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) based on average-measure, consistency-agreement, 2-way random-effects model. Values less than 0.5 represent weak reliability, values between 0.5 and 0.75 indicate moderate reliability,



45



values between 0.75 and 0.9 represent good reliability and those values greater than 0.90 indicate excellent reliability. Total incivility, total questions, and interruptions had ICC's of .93, .91 and .93, respectively, which are excellent reliabilities. Items that had good ICC values were manager `negative tone', and `open questions'. Items that had moderate ICC values were manager `closed questions', `insults and disrespectful remarks', and `hostile looks'. Manager's `eye contact', `impatient', and `accused incompetence' all had weak ICC values. `Raised voice', `unprofessional terms' and `paid little attention' could not be measured, as one coder did not code them at all, making it a constant variable. For specific values, see Table 6.3.

Simulator Consistency In order to determine if there were any differences between the behaviours of the two simulators, I conducted two one-way ANOVAs, one for the time pressure condition and one for the no time pressure condition, to determine if the simulator impacted manager incivility rates. Interestingly, in the no time pressure condition, there was no significant difference in incivility rates between the two groups (Simulator 1: N= 37, m=.26, SE= .14; Simulator 2: N=22, m=.19, SE= .06), F (1,28)= .16, p>.05. Results can be seen in Appendix U. Within the time pressure condition, however, there was a statistically significant difference in incivility rates based on which simulator was used (Simulator 1: m=0.82, SE= .01; Simulator 2: m=.26, SE= .05), F (1,28)=10.75, p<.01. Levene's test of Homogeneity of Variance was violated, therefore a Welch test was conducted, F (1, 10.06) = 6.10, p<.05. We can therefore conclude that individuals who had Simulator 2 had higher incivility rates in the time pressure condition than those individuals who had Simulator 1. Results can be seen in Appendix V (will format table and insert here). To check if the time manipulation worked, I compared the binary measure (`Did you feel under time pressure', yes or no) between the two conditions. The mean of the measure was higher in the time pressure condition (m= 0.71) compared to the no time pressure condition (m= 0.62). This demonstrates that the manipulation did in fact work, such that the participants in the time pressure condition reported feeling under time pressure more often than the individuals in the no time pressure condition did. To determine if gender played a significant role in the rate of incivility, an independent samples t-test was conducted. Levene's test of Homogeneity of Variance was not violated, F(1,57)=.75, p>.05, suggesting that the group variances were equal, so we can conclude that there is no significant difference between gender in terms of incivility rates, t(42.39)= .48, p>.05. These findings may not be valid due to unequal group size (more females than males), and therefore it is possible that the results could have been different if there was an equal amount of males and females.

Hypothesis Tests To analyze the main hypothesis we used a regression analysis where time pressure (no time pressure, actual time pressure) is the independent variable and incivility (frequency of uncivil behaviours) and respectful inquiry are the dependent variables. The control variables were gender, trait negative affect, trait positive affect, sense of autonomy, and need for autonomy. This analysis will allow us to determine the differences that the level of the independent variable has on incivility; from these results we will gain insight into causality. A series of independent ttests and correlations were conducted to measure subsequent hypotheses. A multiple hierarchical regression was run to test if time pressure as well as the control variables gender, trait PA, trait NA, sense of autonomy and need for autonomy significantly predicted incivility rates. The results of the regression indicated that these variables did not significantly predict rates of incivility (R2= .14, F(6,51)=1.38, p>.05). These results do not support Hypothesis 1a. Table 6.5 demonstrates the regression coefficients. Table 6.5 Regression Coefficients for Incivility Predicators.

Dependent variable= Incivility Rate N= 58 A second, very similar multiple hierarchical regression was conducted to test if feelings of time pressure as well as the control variables gender, trait PA, trait NA, sense of autonomy and need for autonomy significantly predicted incivility rates. A non significant regression was found (R2 =.13, F (6,51) = 1.29, p >.05). This analysis was a secondary test in case feelings of time pressure spread across both conditions. To address Hypothesis 1b, I conducted am independent t-test to determine if managers in the time pressure condition interrupted the employee more often. It was found that there was no significant difference in the frequency of interruptions between the `time pressure' condition (m=.17, SE= .13) and the `no time pressure' condition (m=.26, SE=.51), t(56)= -.60, p>.05. This finding does not support Hypothesis 1b.



50



To analyze Hypothesis 2, I conducted a correlation to determine if there was a relationship between employee incivility and manager incivility. A significant positive relationship was found between employee incivility and manager incivility, r=.27, p<. 05. This suggests that as managers become more uncivil, so too will the employee, therefore Hypothesis 3 was supported. These results corroborate the idea of the incivility spiral proposed by Andersson and Pearson (1999). An independent t-test was conducted to determine if there was a difference in the number of questions asked by managers in the time pressure condition versus the no time pressure condition. This will address Hypothesis 3a. Managers who are put under time pressure will ask fewer questions. No significant difference was found between the number of questions asked by managers under time pressure (m=11.85, SE=1.05) versus those not under time pressure (m=13.57, SE= 1.72), t(45.413)= -.85, ns, equal variances were not assumed. Though there was not a significant difference, it is interesting to note that the mean number of questions asked was indeed lower in the `time pressure' condition than the `no time pressure' condition, as seen in Table 6.6, therefore suggesting partial support for Hypothesis 3a. It was found, however, that there was a significant negative relationship between the total number of questions asked by managers and manager incivility, r=-.26, p<.05. This suggests that as manager incivility increased, the number of questions they asked decreased. Table 6.6. Means, Standard Deviations and Standard Errors for the number of questions asked N Time Pressure No Time Pressure 30 28 M 11.85 13.57 SD 5.77 9.11 SE 1.05 1.72

To further expand on this analysis, I conducted a supplementary test to determine if there was a difference in the number of open questions asked my managers in the `time pressure' condition (m=6.41, SE=.66) compared to managers in the `no time pressure' condition (m=5.83, SE=.91).



51



Findings suggest no significant difference in the number of open questions asked between the groups, t(56)=.52, ns. See Table 6.7 for more information. Table 6.7. Means, Standard Deviations and Standard Errors for the number of open questions asked N Time Pressure No Time Pressure 30 28 M 6.41 5.83 SD 3.56 4.90 SE .66 .91

A one-tailed repeated measures t-test was conducted to determine if there was a difference in the number of open versus closed questions asked by managers. This will address Hypothesis 3b. Managers who are put under time pressure will ask more closed questions than open questions. There was not found to be a significant difference in the number of open questions (m= 6.35, SE= .64) compared to the number of closed questions (m=5.55, SE= .64) asked by managers under time pressure, t (29)= 1.46, p>.05. Table 6.8 demonstrates the descriptive statistics. Table 6.8. Means, Standard Deviations and Standard Errors for the number of open and closed questions asked by managers in the time pressure condition. N Open Questions 30 Closed Questions 30 M 6.35 5.55 SD 3.52 2.91 SE .64 .53

To determine if a relationship existed between the total number of questions asked by the manager and the employee's incivility (Hypothesis 4), I conducted a correlation. This hypothesis was not supported, r=.01, ns. Suggesting that the number of questions asked by the manager had no impact on the employee's incivility.



52



A few additional analyses were run to determine if there was a correlation between the different incivility measures. Findings suggest that there was no relationship between selfreported incivility from the manager and the employee's self-report of experienced incivility from the manager, r=.06, ns. Further, we conducted similar analyses to determine the relationship between manager self-reported incivility and third-party coding of the same behaviour, as well as the employee experience of incivility and the third-party coding of the same behaviour. It was found that the relationship between managers self-report of their own incivility and the third-party rater's report of the manager's incivility in the same scenario was non significant, r=-.04. Interestingly, a significantly positive relationship was found between the employee's self-report of their experienced incivility from the manager and the third-party coding of the manager's incivility, r=.52, p<.001. Other interesting results were that manager sense of autonomy was found to have a significant negative relationship to manager's trait negative affect, r=-.27, p<.05. This suggests that higher levels of trait negative affect are related to lower levels of sense of autonomy. In other words, when negative affect increases, feelings of autonomy and control decrease. However, a relationship was not found between managers' sense of autonomy and their rate of incivility, r= -.18, p>.05. This suggests that sense of autonomy or the participants' feelings of control over the performance appraisal may be negatively related to their acts of incivility but that the effect did not reach significance. A significantly positive relationship was found between need for autonomy and trait positive affect, r=.37, p<.01. This suggests that people who are high in trait positive affect have a higher need for autonomy and control. The lack of correlation between trait characteristics and incivility does not support previous research on the topic (Reio & Ghosh, 2009). To summarize the supplementary findings, Table 6.9 demonstrates a correlation matrix that includes a number of correlations considered for this study. Table 6.9. Correlation Matrix

Chapter 7: Discussion Contributions to Theory and Research Research over the past few decades has brought subtle detrimental workplace behaviours into light (Kunkel et al., 2015). Where more unsubtle and intended interpersonal mistreatment such as aggression, bullying, or sexual harassment were the focus of workplace mistreatment literature (Lim et al., 2008), the negative impacts of the subtle, ambiguous, and nonphysical form of mistreatment known as incivility continues to be explored as its presence in the workplace becomes more prevalent (van Jaarsveld et al., 2010). As previously mentioned, outcomes of incivility have been given greater attention than its antecedents (Meier & Semmer, 2012). Therefore, through an extensive literature review I explored the antecedents of workplace incivility at the macro, meso, and micro levels, covering relationships between incivility and workplace culture (Pearson & Porath, 2004), to power imbalances (Estes & Wang, 2008), to emotional exhaustion (Blau & Andersson, 2005). This literature review offered a view into incivility and provided awareness into the gaps that still need to be investigated. The main goal of the current study was to fill a gap revolving around the time pressure-incivility relationship. To do this, I specifically set out to determine if time pressure influences managers to act uncivilly in a performance appraisal session. Subsequent purposes included finding support for the incivility spiral, as well as support regarding the relationships between incivility and gender, trait characteristics, autonomy, and power imbalances. Previous literature suggested a relationship between time pressure and incivility based upon qualitative studies, such as interviews or diary studies (Chris, 2014; Cortina et al., 2001). Additionally, previous research on incivility typically used self-report measures, both for experienced and instigated incivility. As demonstrated earlier, self-report measures are open to social desirability bias and often revolve around recall of past events (Robinson & Clore, 2002). Unlike interviews, case studies or focus groups, experimental designs allow for the exploration of causality. Without causality antecedents cannot be determined, thus, in order to determine if time pressure indeed does cause incivility to increase, an experimental design was necessary. The current research adds to the literature by providing a starting point for exploring time pressure and incivility using an experimental design and measuring incivility from the
55





perspective of a third party with real time behaviour. This type of methodology minimizes both social desirability in the reporting of incivility and eliminates the faults of one's memory. By including the traditional experienced and instigated self-report measures, the current study allowed for the comparison between these two perspectives on the same behaviour, as well as that of the third-party perspective. Self-determination theory (SDT), the theoretical background for this study, proposes that all humans have basic psychological and motivational needs (Van Quaquebeke & Felps, 2016) and this differs from prior studies, which have tended to be conducted in the context of social exchange or job-demands resources (JDR) theory (Fonseca, Brauer, Moisuc & Nugier, 2013; Torkelson et al., 2016). A limitation of the JDR model is that it does not take into account the impact of dispositional factors or intrinsic motivation when looking at the causes of incivility, while self-determination theory (SDT) does. Self-Determination Theory is an appropriate theory for investigating the current research questions for two reasons: first, my research questions consider incivility in the workplace. Since work is a type of social environment in which many individuals spend the majority of their waking hours, it should be no surprise that stressors and resources apparent in the workplace will have significant impacts on the psychological needs of individuals (Van Quaquebeke & Felps, 2016). Secondly, my research question not only considers antecedents of incivility at the micro level of analysis (time pressure), but also takes into account additional variables at the dispositional level (gender, trait NA, trait PA) and intrinsic motivational variables and the role of psychological needs (sense of autonomy and need for autonomy) play on incivility. While this study specifically looked at the SDT component sense of autonomy as a motivation underlying the proposed relationship, the competence and relatedness components could also be explored. Of the seven hypotheses proposed for this study, only one was supported. While disappointing, these relationships and results are worth further consideration. Table 7.1 offers a summary of the hypotheses, as well as which were supported and which were not. Figure 7.1. Summary of Hypotheses

Contrary to expectations (Hypothesis 1a), I was unable to confirm that time pressure is an antecedent to incivility. While the manipulation was found to have worked, it could be that by focusing on time pressure, I may have overlooked the underlying motivations. Participants were motivated to show up in order to receive a bonus mark in their course, but perhaps there was not enough in the study to motivate them to a) be invested in their role in the performance appraisal session or b) to want to create positive resolutions for the employee's behaviour. As discussed in the literature review, research has proposed that the way in which individuals internalize their work could impact their moral behaviour (Birkeland & Nerstad, 2016). Instead of trying to discuss the appraisal in a way that allowed the employee to see the manager's perspective, while also seeking to understand the employee's perspective, many of the managers heard what the employee had to say and then moved on to the next section, not trying to obtain a mutual tagreement or understanding; there was limited back and forth discussion. Participants may not have been motivated to take the role seriously, or to try and develop an action plan with the employee, but rather simply wanted to get through it. In the future, perhaps an incentive could be added for completing the action plan and having more specific outcomes that the managers are striving to achieve. More than being motivated, perhaps the managers lacked passion. Birkeland and Nerstad (2016) found that an individual's obsessive passion for work would result
 57



in increased instigated incivility; perhaps if this scenario was real to the participants, actually had an impact on their daily lives, and their success, the passion would have been present, and they would have behaved in a different manner. The performance appraisal scenario was in part chosen due to it being a workplace setting with strong potential for incivility. This was believed due to previous research that found `status' and `power' to be related to incivility (Pearson & Porath, 2004). It is suggested that the lack of significant findings in the current study could be due to that the `status' element not working out. Though the parties were given a role which held a certain status, the status differential may have been revoked due to the `employee' being older, better prepared, and therefore likely more confident. It was found that when manager incivility was high, so was employee incivility, supporting Hypothesis 2. This finding supports research findings from Pearson and Porath (2005), Torkelson et al. (2016), and Van Jaarsveld et al. (2010) who all found evidence to support the idea that experience of incivility has led an individual to instigate incivility. This is similar to the incivility spiral (Andersson & Pearson, 1999), which suggests the same underlying relationship but with the addition of spiralling severity with each incivility response. Interestingly, while Torkelson et al. (2016) did not find that being a target of supervisor incivility predicted instigated incivility, our results would suggest otherwise. However, it could be that the supervisor-subordinate dynamic was not present in our study, and the manager and employee felt more like coworkers; this is very plausible and would be in line with Torkelson et al., (2016)'s findings. Our findings demonstrate the relational aspect of incivility: social support, reciprocity, and relationships with coworkers together impact behaviour, including incivility (Reio & Ghosh, 2009; Semmer & Meier, 2012; Torkelson et al., 2016). It also addresses the importance of having a civil workplace and cordial relationships in controlling incivility caused by interpersonal exchanges. Reciprocity is a welcome concept when the behaviour is positive and civil, however reciprocity in a negative context is a recipe for an uncivil workplace. It was expected that managers in the time pressure condition would ask fewer questions overall as well as fewer open-ended questions than those managers in the time pressure condition (Hypothesis 3a and 3b, respectively). These expectations were not met. This may also be a
58





result of the time pressure not impacting stress levels to the point of changing their behaviour. However, it may also be a case of basic coping mechanisms. When an individual does not know what to do, they have been conditioned to ask questions. As mentioned, many of the participants had no experience conducting a performance appraisal, therefore, in times of uncertainty perhaps they relied on asking the participant questions in order to not only gather more information, but possibly also to use up time. Interestingly, while time pressure did not appear to impact the manager's overall incivility, I did find that within the `time pressure' condition, there was a statistically significant difference in incivility rates depending on which simulator was used. To put this differently, managers who participated in the performance appraisal with Simulator 1 as the employee behaved uncivilly more than managers whom participated in the performance appraisal with Simulator 2. What is also interesting is that this finding is only present in the `time pressure' condition and not in the `no time pressure' condition. This could suggest that one simulator was influenced by time pressure, whereas the other was not. Alternatively, this could also be explained by a combination of the simulators nature and the incivility spiral. Perhaps simulator 1 was naturally more uncivil, only in the time pressure condition, and thus this elicited more incivility from the managers she dealt with. These results highlight the complexity of incivility and again emphasize the relational aspect of it. Based on a proposition by Jex (2010), which suggested that when a situation grows increasingly stressful, incivility is used as a mechanism for gaining control, I tested to determine if their was a negative relationship between when a mangers sense of autonomy and their incivility. By implementing the time pressure manipulation, it was believed that the managers would feel less autonomous and more stressed, thus resulting in greater incivility. Additionally, given that the majority of participants had never conducted a performance appraisal before, it was anticipated that sense of autonomy would be lower. In contrast to these propositions, it was not found that low sense of autonomy was correlated to higher levels of incivility. Perhaps stress-induced incivility is only present after a certain threshold of stress is reached; while students felt pressured for time, perhaps this scenario was not stressful enough.



59



Through a supplemental analysis, it was found that while manager self-reports of their own incivility was not correlated to employee or third-party reports of manager incivility, it was found that the employee reports of experienced incivility from the manager and the third-party reports of the managers incivility were significantly correlated (See Table 7). This finding suggests that instigators of incivility underrate their own levels of incivility. This supports previous literature that found evidence to suggest that individuals tactically manipulate their own beliefs and memory in order to reduce their remorse or to preserve their self-esteem (Li, 2013). This finding may impact future research in regard to how incivility is measured. Perhaps the difference lies in the `intentions', whereby managers do not intend to be uncivil, however their behaviours are portrayed as uncivil. Alternatively, it may be that individuals think of themselves, their behaviours, and their experiences more positively than reality, this idea is supported by the `rosy view' which proposes that an individual's experience is actually less positive than their recollection of it (Mitchell, Thompson, Peterson & Cronk, 1997). Lastly, it has been suggested that individuals who experience unkind acts have a lower memory recall accuracy compared to those who experience positive acts (Li, 2013). What this tells us is that participants who experienced incivility likely underrated their experience, recalling it as less uncivil as it may have been. Therefore if both instigators and those who experience incivility are recalling events as more civil or pleasant than they actually were, than we can assume that selfreport measures capture less incivility than there actually was. This finding is certainly interesting and worth further exploration as it may impact the validity of behaviour reporting types (ie. reporting on your own behaviour, your experiences, or on perceptions of other's behaviour). While the results of this study were not all expected, it is believed that the current study establishes a solid start in the realm of experimental incivility research. Time pressure as an antecedent of incivility, though seemingly obvious, has yet to be statistically confirmed. This is the first known study to consider this relationship experimentally, and perhaps it can open doors for, and inspire, further research attention.



60



Limitations There are several limitations to this study. First, since participants are drawn from Ryerson University's participant pool, the participants are students; however, perhaps their behaviours can be generalized to real managers in the workplace. While this was an ideal scenario for obtaining participants and conducting an experimental study, for future research, however, it would be more ideal to use participants that are in managerial positions. If this were the case, participants may take the research more seriously and it would likely result in findings that are closer to reality. Secondly, this study presents the opportunity for social desirability, whereby individuals may respond in a way that they believe they are wanted to respond, rather than how they would want to respond. This could have presented itself both in responses to the survey questions, or within the performance appraisal itself. Thus, it would be reasonable to suspect that there would actually be more incivility in a real-life context. In line with altering behaviour due to the experimental nature of the study, one participant suggested that had there been a clock in the room, she might have felt more pressured. This suggested that the time pressure manipulation was not strong enough. Alternatively, after hearing the true purpose of the research study and learning about the time conditions, some participants claimed that although they did feel rushed, when asked on the post survey if they felt under time pressure, they answered `no', because they did not think that they should have felt the pressure. This not only skews the manipulation check, but may also have had an impact on the results relating `felt time pressure' to incivility. Third, the video recording of the performance appraisals may have encouraged participants to be on their best behaviour, ultimately decreasing the chances of incivility. The next few limitations refer to the measurement and coding aspects of the current study. The incivility measure assumed that each of the uncivil behaviours had an equal impact. While this seemed reasonable for the given study objectives, as it was about the presence and frequency of incivility, it may be that certain behaviours should have been weighed more heavily than others. For example, perhaps making eye contact should not have been weighted the same



61



as if the manager accused the employee of incompetence or made disrespectful remarks. This would be something to consider further in future research. Fourth, an actor played the employee. While the simulator was trained in role-play simulations, their reactions may not be as genuine as if it was a real life scenario. Perhaps the simulator required further training, not only in how to take on their role insofar as their sales performance and customer service, but also in how to interact with a superior manager in a more realistic way. Additional limitations regarding the simulator, is that they were more prepared for the scenario in a number of ways compared to the manager, which may have impacted the `realness' of the scenario. They were given the employee self-appraisal a head of time, where as the manager was given the appraisal when they arrived. Further, the simulator took part in 22 or 38 performance appraisal sessions, giving them experience in what to expect and how to handle the issues in a way that elicited more or less tension, anger, or incivility from the manager. These factors allowed the simulator to walk into the appraisal feeling more confident and selfassured than the employee. While it has been noted that men are more likely to act in an uncivil manner compared to women when the target is someone of a lower status (Jex, 2010), it is believed that the confidence and age of the employee eliminated the gender difference in manager incivility, as a result of the weakening of the status differential. If this experiment was done again, I would change the profile of the employee, making her weaknesses harder to accommodate, and enlarging the status differential. Fifth, the inter-rater reliability of the coders on certain variables was weaker than anticipated. Though they were each given the same sheet of examples and/or definitions of each of the variables to be coded, the discrepancy in their coding may be due to a lack of training together. During the pilot study the coders were trained together, however for the main study, hiring issues caused one coder to be hired earlier and they started the coding before the other, thus it was not possible to train them together. Perhaps having both coders coding several videos together would have improved the inter-rater reliability. Coding both verbal and nonverbal behaviours likely attributed to the low inter-rater reliabilities. Nonverbal behaviours can be transmitted through facial expressions, vocal cues, body postures, gestures, and eye gazing (Matsumoto, Frank, & Hwang, 2012). Although the coders were looking for a particular kinds of non verbal behaviour, and they were devoted to watching the person of interest even when
 62



they were not speaking, nonverbal behaviours can be so subtle and covert that they are not noticeable to the average person (Matsumoto, 2012). Therefore a coder, who has to code 60 videos twice, is likely to zone out or miss nonverbal behaviours. Further, an individual can express verbal and nonverbal behaviour at the same time, however, at times these two forms of communication can contradict one another (Matsumoto, 2012), making it more challenging to code if the coder is not giving it their undivided attention. While a number of the variables that were coded had weak intraclass coefficients, I do believe that with more training and perhaps more examples of what certain behaviours would look like, the ICC would have not only been higher, but incivility as a whole would have been found more. I believe that this would be the case because I witnessed instances of, for example, "not paying attention to the employee's thoughts, statements, or concerns" happening while viewing a number of the sessions, and after discussing the sessions with the `employees' afterwards, they too brought up feeling that the manager did not listen, or pay attention to their concerns and comments. It is possible that using graduate psychology students in the future, rather than undergraduate students, may be a better choice, as they not only would be more familiar with research and coding in general, but they may also be better equipped at observing behaviour. While the inter-rater reliability was an issue, the main limitation of the current study was that incivility is a low-frequency variable. Several of the incivility items, for example `paid little attention' or `unprofessional terms', were coded as non-existent in the majority of the performance appraisal sessions, with the behaviour observed in only a few videos. Perhaps this is why Cortina et al. (2001) used a 5-year time span for recall of incivility on their questionnaire, or Andersson and Blau (2005) used a 1-year time span. In trying to eliminate recall errors and wanting to capture incivility in real-time, we instead experienced a limited amount of incivility due to a short time segment and one specific scenario rather than a multi-month time segment encompassing numerous different time pressured scenarios. Suggestions for Future Research Research is a continuous cycle of learning, at the end of every study there arises more opportunities for further exploration. Simply taking what was successful and applying it to other areas or taking what was not successful and using that as a starting block, future opportunities are vast. The current research resulted in several opportunities for future research.

As researchers or anyone reading a research paper, we should always approach results from a student sample with a certain degree of caution in terms of generalizability. Indeed the student sample offers a good representation of Toronto's diversity, and this particular sample included individuals who are likely to pursue a career in an organizational setting, however it is important to note that life, education, and work experiences may be lacking compared to those already holding managerial positions within the workplace. Therefore, future research may consider working with a sample of individuals who are currently, or have previously held managerial positions. This would bring other aspects into play, including competence, assuredness, and the role of power may be more prominent. This would eliminate the uncertainty about how a performance appraisal should flow, and offer a more real-life experience. Future research may also consider making the difference between the time conditions more drastic. This could involve eliminating any overarching time constraints. For example, in the current study participants signed up knowing that the entire session was a maximum of an hour, since timeslots were posted by the hour and they only got credited for 1 hour. Additionally, those in the `no time pressure' condition also knew that the performance appraisal portion of the session would take around 20 minutes. If time constraints on the end of the researcher were not present, (ie. room availability, simulator availability, deadlines), and participants were less aware of session times, it may make a difference since the `no time pressure' condition could actually be presented with no time bounds at all. This could eliminate the chance of individuals in the `no time pressure' condition feeling under time pressure. Having a motivational aspect for the employees to get through the entirety of the performance appraisal may make the time pressure more real, and as a result, bring out more uncivil behaviours. Additionally, offering a motivational aspect to the study that that encourages the participant to take on the role of the manager and care about the results of the session could be beneficial. The participant came into the session knowing that at the end of the appraisal they were finished with the employee, but perhaps if there was some type of relational aspect or the potential for future encounters with the employee, the dynamic would shift from merely a `lets get this over with' mentality. Whether or not individuals are more apt to act in an uncivil



64



manner towards someone they have a relationship with versus someone they do not have a relationship with may also be of interest in future research. As stated previously, I think it would be interesting for future research to consider the reliability between experienced and instigated incivility scales revolving around the same behaviours, and further, to support findings from the current study, explore how third-party ratings compared to these. This research is important because it will impact the validity of studies using these methods, and affect the way that their results are interpreted. For example, if a discrepancy is still found, are experienced incivility reports inflated, or are instigated reports underrated? The current study piloted the use of a new third party coding system for incivility, to eliminate self-report biases in future research, researchers should consider further development of a strong third party coding system, and getting it validated.

Appendix A: Description of Study on SONA Abstract As part of this research, we are looking for volunteers to play the role of a manager in a role-play performance appraisal discussion with his or her employee. This will take approximately 1 hourplease see the detailed description for more info. Description We're interested in trying to get a better idea about how managers address performance problems during a role-play performance appraisal discussion. We are asking for volunteers who would be willing to review a written performance appraisal, conduct a performance appraisal discussion with an actor who has been trained to play the role of your employee, and then complete a post meeting survey. Reading the performance appraisal, the discussion with the employee, and a post- role play survey is expected to take approximate one hour. The performance appraisal discussion will be video-recorded, and we will use a discussion coding system to provide us with data to be analyzed. This study is estimated to be one hour in length and would earn you 1% towards your maximum 2% research participation bonus. However, it is possible that the process may take slightly longer, and you will receive the appropriate credit for the length of the actual time you spend (i.e., for every 15-minute segment over the hour, you will receive an additional 0.25 credit. If the study takes less than 1 hour, you will still receive the full 1% credit. In addition to course credit you will be receiving guidelines on how to conduct an effective performance appraisal and you will receive notes from the actor playing the employee on her experience of your communication skills.

Before you consent to participate, please ask any questions to be sure you understand what your participation will involve. TITLE OF THE STUDY- A Manager-Employee Performance Appraisal Discussion INVESTIGATORS: The principal investigator of this study is Vanessa Martini, a graduate student from TRSM at Ryerson University, under the supervision of Dr. Pat Sniderman. If you have any questions or concerns about the research, please feel free to contact Vanessa at vanessa.martini@ryerson.ca or Pat at 416-979-5000 ext. 6751 or at psnider@ryerson.ca PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The study is designed to assess effective managerial behaviour during performance appraisal discussions. This is a study involving 60 undergraduate students. WHAT YOU WILL BE ASKED TO DO: If you volunteer to participate in this study, you will be asked to do the following things: 1. Take the role of a manager during a performance appraisal role play discussion. 2. You will be given a description of your role as well as a completed performance appraisal form prior to the meeting. 3. You will meet to discuss the appraisal and plan actions to improve the employee's performance 4. Your meeting will be videotaped so that communication can be coded. 5. After the meeting you will be asked to complete a short survey with questions about your personality as well as your reactions to the meeting. 6. Research findings will be available to you upon completion of the survey as well as guidelines for effective performance appraisal discussions POTENTIAL BENEFITS: I cannot guarantee that you will gain any direct benefit from participating in this study. However, this may help you in your future career, as you will experience a performance appraisal discussion from the perspective of a manager. You will also receive guidelines for effective performance appraisal interviews. WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL RISKS TO YOU AS A PARTICIPANT: Potential risks are very low however, since the employee's poor performance will be discussed and she might get
 67



defensive, you may feel uncomfortable. To mitigate the risks, after the performance appraisal discussion is complete, the participant will be given a debriefing form of the study to read over, they will have the opportunity to ask the researcher any questions, and they will be given constructive feedback on their performance from the actors who has been trained to give feedback. CONFIDENTIALITY: The researcher will make every reasonable effort to maintain your confidentiality. When we report what we find, we will only share the "averaged" answers across many participants, meaning that no single participant risks being identified through the data. Although we collect your SONA TRSM Student Research Pool ID to ensure that you will receive credit, this information is stored separately from the answers you provide. Your meeting will be videotaped for coding afterwards. You have the right to review/edit the recordings or transcripts. The video recordings and responses to study questions will be stored digitally for 2 years and will then be destroyed. Only the research team (Vanessa Martini, Dr. Pat Sniderman, and 2 Research Assistants) will have access to the raw and transcribed recordings; they will sign a confidentially agreement to keep all participant-related information confidential. The data collected during the study will be used for academic purposes only, and will not be disseminated or provided to any third-party. When not in use, the data will be stored in a password-protected file. INCENTIVES FOR PARTICIPATION: In exchange for participating in this study, you will receive a credit of 1% towards your accumulated bonus as part of the TRSM Student Research Pool. VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION AND WITHDRAWAL: Participation in this study is completely voluntary. You can choose whether to be in this study or not. If any question on the post meeting survey makes you uncomfortable, you can skip that question. You may stop participating at any time and you will still be given the incentive described above. Because the study stores your SONA TRSM Student Research Pool ID separately from the data, there is no reasonable way to remove your answers from the study at a later date, after you have provided consent. Your choice of whether or not to participate will not influence your future relations with Ryerson University or Dr. Sniderman. Please note that by signing this consent form you are providing your consent for participation. By consenting to participate you are not waiving any of your legal rights as a research participant. QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STUDY: If you have any questions about the research now, please ask.

Appendix I Debriefing Form

Dear study participant. Thank you very much for participating in this study. The purpose of the study was to better understand managerial communication behavior in differing contexts. You were randomly assigned to either a "time pressure" or a "no time pressure" context but you will be compensated for the allocated time, regardless of which condition you were in. Our goal is to determine how time pressure and feelings of autonomy contribute to incivility and respectful inquiry in a performance appraisal setting. For example, we suspect that a manager under time pressure would interrupt the employee more than a manger would under no time pressure. As mentioned in the SONA recruitment ad, the employee you evaluated was actually a trained actor. Based on the actual purpose of the study, you can choose to withdraw from the study. If you decide to remain in the study, you will sign another consent form, agreeing that your data can be used as part of this research study. All study participants will receive by email, upon completion of the study (late Fall), some guidelines for effective communication during performance appraisals, to help you in your future business management career. If you feel distressed after participating in this research, there are resources available to you: Centre for Student Development & Counselling ­ 416-979-5195 Good2Talk - Post-Secondary Student Helpline - 1-866-925-5454

Appendix K: Scale Modifications

Original "Made unwanted attempts to draw you into a discussion of personal matters" and "Ignored or excluded you from professional camaraderie" Cortina et al. (2001) Cortina et al., 2001: Blau and Andersson, 2005: "How often have you exhibited the following behaviours in the past year"

Modified Not used

Rationale They would be unlikely to come up in a 20-minute performance appraisal.

"How often did you witness the manager (or employee) engage in this behaviour..."

The videos are coded by a third-party, and therefore incivility is not considered from the victim or the instigator, but rather from an outsider. This decreases the chances of social desirability biases. By doing it this way, issues revolving around recall are eliminated.

Cortina et al.'s (2001) experienced incivility scale, Blau and Andersson's (2005) instigated incivility scale, and Martin and Hine's (2005) Uncivil Workplace Behaviour Questionnaire all depend on the recall of incivility within a set of previous years. Cortina et al. (2001) "Addressed you in unprofessional terms, either publicly or privately"

Uses a third party coder who codes in real time while watching the video, therefore no recall is required.

"Used unprofessional terms"

This was adapted because the "privately or publicly" portion of the statement is not valid, as the behaviour must occur within the performance appraisal. The new wording allows this item to encompass a great range of behaviours.

Cortina et al.'s (2001) scale "Doubted someone's judgment in a matter over which they have


"Accused Incompetence"

96



responsibility" Cortina et al. (2001) "Made demeaning or derogatory remarks about you" "Insults or disrespectful remarks" There is a great deal of overlap between these two items, however this modification is worded in more basic terms to make it easier for the coders and the participants to understand.



97



Appendix L: The current measure

How many times did the manager (or employee) engage in the following behaviour... Frequency of Behaviour Ask open questions? Ask closed questions? Ask follow up questions? Pay little attention to the employee/manager's statements or opinions? Examples of this would be if the listener is neither making eye contact nor making notes, or if they appear zoned out or staring into space, verbally. This may be demonstrated by not addressing what the other party had just said, or changing the subject. Give hostile looks (including raised eyebrows, eye rolls, sneers, etc.)? Use unprofessional terms? Make insults or disrespectful remarks towards the other party? Interrupt the other party when they were speaking? Accuse the other party of incompetence? For example: if one of the members involved makes a statement that questions the party's judgement, or could be perceived as making the other person feel unimportant or small, or if the party says something in a way that flaunts their superiority. Show impatience towards the other party?



98



Impatience may be demonstrated through verbal or nonverbal behaviour such as sighing, tapping the table, getting visibly flustered, putting their hands up or palms facing the ceiling, quick/short responses Avoid eye contact when speaking to, or listening to the other party? Example: stares elsewhere when speaking to, or being spoken from, the other party. Raise their voice towards the other party? Negative Tone of Voice Examples: sarcastic, snippy, rude tones

Appendix M Description of Study on SONA A Manager-Employee Performance Appraisal Discussion- only for those who identify as male Abstract As part of this research, we are looking for volunteers to play the role of a manager in a role-play performance appraisal discussion with his or her employee. This will take approximately 1 hourplease see the detailed description for more info. Description We're interested in trying to get a better idea about how managers address performance problems during a role play performance appraisal discussion. We are asking for volunteers who would be willing to review a written performance appraisal, conduct a performance appraisal discussion with an actor who has been trained to play the role of your employee, and then complete a post meeting survey. Reading the performance appraisal, the discussion with the employee, and a post- role play survey is expected to take approximate one hour. The performance appraisal discussion will be video-recorded, and we will use a discussion coding system to provide us with data to be analyzed. This study is estimated to be one hour in length and would earn you 1% towards your maximum 2% research participation bonus. However, it is possible that the process may take slightly longer, and you will receive the appropriate credit for the length of the actual time you spend (i.e., for every 15-minute segment over the hour, you will receive an additional 0.25 credit. If the study takes less than 1 hour, you will still receive the full 1% credit. In addition to course credit you will be receiving guidelines on how to conduct an effective performance appraisal and you will receive notes from the actor playing the employee on her experience of your communication skills.

Appendix O PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL DISCUSSION STUDY_A You are Kat Thompson's store manager at a high-end retail clothing store. It is time to do her first performance appraisal. She has been with you for 3 months. As summarized in the performance appraisal form (below) that you filled out, while she is an exceptional salesperson, she tends to avoid all activities that do not help her make sales. She makes no effort to build relationships with coworkers, and she is often late for her shifts. Her job description clearly states that it is her job to serve customers effectively and make sales, handle customer returns and phone inquiries efficiently, assist co-workers as needed and to arrive on time to all scheduled shifts. INSTRUCTIONS: · · Kat has completed a self-appraisal using the same performance appraisal as you. She will be bringing it to the meeting. Your job in this meeting is to review EACH CATEGORY ON THE PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL FORM WITH HER, GET HER INPUT AND FORMULATE AN ACTION PLAN FOR IMPROVEMENT Recognize her exceptional sales performance and keep her motivated-you don't want to lose her. Get her to understand and take responsibility for the other aspects of her performance that are unacceptable. Write an action plan for improvement that you both sign off on.
