Towards Determining the Effect of Shallow Depth Horizontal Ground Loop Clearance on the Heat Loss of a Single Family Residential Dwelling Felix Chen,2018. Master of Building Science, Ryerson University

Abstract
Using solar energy stored in the ground to preheat incoming fresh ventilation air with ground loops is a renewable energy system which is becoming more frequently used in new residential developments. The purpose of this research was to examine the effect of ground loop to foundation wall clearance on building heat loss. Additionally, the thermal properties of the soil were examined to determine their impact on the ground loop's effect on heat loss. A simulation based research approach was conducted using HEAT3, which is a three-dimensional transient heat transfer software. This study found that ground loop clearance had a larger impact on building heat loss for areas with low thermal conductivity soils than for areas with high thermal conductivity soils. On average, ground loop clearances of 10cm, 50cm, 100cm, and 200cm resulted in increased building heat losses of 20%-83%, 19%-55%, 16%-35%, and 12%-15% respectively.

1 Introduction
Using solar energy stored in the ground to preheat incoming fresh ventilation air with ground loops is a renewable energy system which is becoming more frequently used in new residential developments. The Passive House Institute US (PHIUS) in collaboration with Ryerson University was interested to investigate the effect of ground loop clearance on heat loss from the adjacent building. Energy in the ground can be used to preheat the ventilation fresh air supply at a relatively low cost. A ground loop preheat system functions by passing a freeze protected fluid through a horizontally buried ground loop to exchange heat with the soil, then passes the fluid through a fluid to air heat exchanger, which preheats incoming ventilation air. The ground loop can be installed in nearly any typical building excavation at various stages of construction since its clearance from foundation walls has traditionally been in the order of 1 m to 2 m. Further, it can be placed under slabs, beside footings, and in other trenches dug for utilities or drainage. A typical system consists of plastic piping, isolation valves, manifold headers, a fluid to air heat exchanger, a fluid circulator, a freeze protected fluid such as a refrigerant, expansion tank, air separator, and other closed-loop system components.

A ground loop preheat system has two main benefits. The first of which is that it eliminates the risk of freezing the core (or filters) of a coupled heat recovery ventilator (HRV) or energy recovery ventilator (ERV). HRVs and ERVs traditionally have in-duct electric resistance preheaters which add considerable operation costs, energy use and installation cost. According to Holladay (2015), using a ground loop system to preheat incoming ventilation air rather than an electric resistance heater leads to an annual savings of 244 kWh to 1315 kWh. Grunau and Craven (2015) found the sensible recovery efficiency (SRE) of a Zehnder ComfoAir 350 dropped from 88% to 49% when using an electric preheater, since the electricity used to preheat the intake air is accounted for in the SRE, which ultimately lowers it. In the case that the HRV or ERV does freeze, the defrost mode of these systems recirculates indoor air and prevents the delivery of fresh air. Therefore, eliminating the risk of freezing in a costeffective manner is the most beneficial approach. The second benefit of a ground loop preheat system is that it saves energy. The system itself consumes a very low amount of electrical power while the energy used to preheat the incoming ventilation air is "free" energy available in the soil, which is recharged mainly by solar radiation and by the energy stored below buildings that maintains stable soil temperatures. Typically, horizontal ground loops are buried in a shallow trench at a depth between 1.0m and 2.0m (GeoCom, 2007). These trenches are within soil 2

fluctuations only penetrate within 0.1 m to 0.3 m of depth (Banks, 2008). Soil temperature fluctuations, which are caused by solar radiation, precipitation, and ambient air temperature are predictable and consistent. When a horizontal ground heat exchanger (HGHE) is installed in a heating dominated climate, the seasonal soil temperature distribution can be affected since energy flows from the ground to the ambient exterior for more than half of the year. Removing energy from the ground will decrease soil temperature and increase the temperature difference between the interior space of a building and the surrounding ground, which results in an increase in heat losses. As would be expected, the change in soil temperature caused by ground loops is highest at the soil-ground loop interface, with the effects minimizing as distance from the ground loop increases. To reduce the building heat loss caused by the operation of a ground loop, the loop should be installed as far from the building as possible; however, due to potential spacing constraints during construction, ground loops may need to be installed closer to a foundation wall. As the

ground loop comes closer to a foundation wall, the potential exists for increased heat loss from the adjacent building. This effectively short-circuits the

renewable aspect of the ground loop and increases energy loss from the building. This research explores the relationship between increased building heat loss, ground loop clearance and soil typology. 3

1.1 Objectives of the Major Research Project
The main objective of this major research project (MRP) is to better understand the impact that ground loops, at various clearances from the foundation wall, have on a building's heat loss. The secondary objective is to determine how the soil type and associated properties affect the impact that ground loop clearance has on the heat loss of the building. It is anticipated the findings from this research can be used to develop a guideline for prescribing ground loop clearance from foundation walls for the PHIUS+2018 standard. A simulation based approach was used to carry out the research. The analysis considered the impact that the environment and the operation of the ground loop have on the temperature profile of the soil surrounding a building. Once the cause and effect relationship between the independent and dependent variables is determined, then a prescriptive ground loop placement guideline for a wide range of systems can be developed.

1.2 Research Questions
The aim of this research was to determine the building envelope heat losses induced by the operation of a ground loop at various distances from a foundation wall. The two proposed research questions are: 1) What effect does shallow depth horizontal ground loop to foundation wall clearance have on the heat loss of a single family residential dwelling? 2) How do the thermal properties of the surrounding soil affect the shallow depth horizontal ground loop clearance's impact on the heat loss of a single family residential dwelling?

2 Literature Review
2.1 Development of the Research Questions
A ground loop preheat system is similar to a ground source heat pump (GSHP) system in that it extracts heat from the ground using horizontal ground heat exchangers (HGHE). Rosen and Koohi-Fayegh (2017) published a ground source design textbook which provides guidance for sizing ground loop piping, loop placement, ground loop length, and burial depth. However, details on ground loop placement relative to the building envelope were not provided, possibly because the focus of the HGHE design is to maximize heat transfer of the loop and the problem of additional building heat loss induced by the ground loop may not be obvious. In fact, the Bard Manufacturing Ground Coupled Loop System Design Manual (2007) only specifies loop placement relative to other loops and not the foundation wall. HGHEs function by circulating a lower temperature working fluid, typically a brine solution, through the closed loop piping system, which allows the fluid to extract heat from the ground. If efficiency of the system can be negatively impacted by the reduction of soil temperature, then it is possible that the building's heat loss can be negatively impacted as well. There has been some research into a HGHE's effect on soil temperature, such as Rosen and Koohi-Fayegh (2017) who observed that HGHE systems installed 6

in soils with high thermal conductivity could result in more significant impacts on the ambient soil temperature. They conducted an experiment on a ground loop system, with the results indicating that after 3 months of operation, the increase in soil temperature due to the ground loops was negligible at distances 10m or greater. After 9 months of operation, the distance increased from 10m to 17m. Temperature sensors were placed adjacent to the HGHE to determine the temperature increase resulting from ground loop operation. After 3 months of operation, the soil temperature was measured to be 0.2 to 0.8 °C higher than the far field soil temperature and after 9 months of operation, the soil temperature was measured to be 1.4 to 2.3 °C higher than the far field soil temperature. Far field soils are similar in composition to the HGHE test soil, but are located at a distance deemed sufficiently far from the temperature changing effects of the HGHE. Pauli, Neuberger, and Adamovsky (2016) conducted a study with the aim of analyzing temperature changes in the ground caused by a linear and slinky-type HGHE and determining the effect on temperature distribution in the ground. The results showed that the temperature difference between the reference average ground temperature and the HGHE area was 2.22 ± 1.23 °C for the linear HGHE and 3.05 ± 1.41 °C for the slinky-type HGHE. Research has been conducted to determine how soil temperature changes induced by HGHEs can impact the efficiency of the overall GSHP system. In fact, Gonzalez et al. (2012) conducted 7

a year-long study of a horizontal GSHP system located in the UK. The findings indicated that heat extraction can considerably alter soil temperatures and moisture content to the extent that GSHP and any other system using ground loops can have their efficiency be compromised. Continued heat extraction from the ground may cause the soil temperature to fall compared to its `natural' temperature, which will affect the water and vapor transfer fluxes, thereby influencing the moisture content and thermal properties of the soil, which ultimately affects the performance of the ground loop system. Although this is an important issue, it has already been extensively covered by Li, Yang, and Zhang (2009). If ground loop system efficiency can be negatively impacted by ground heat extraction, then it is probable that a building's heat loss can be negatively impacted too. Gonzalez et al. (2012) showed that the HGHE influenced the soil temperature within 0.6m from the central long axis of a straight HGHE and within 0.8m for a slinky-type HGHE. For soil depths from 0m to 0.2m, the HGHE had negligible effect on ground temperature since air temperature was shown to have a greater effect (Gonzalez et al, 2012). For a depth between 0.25m and 0.3m, the HGHE was shown to have a more measurable effect on soil temperature. In November 2009, the soil temperature near the HGHE was 3°C lower than the reference soil with the temperature difference increasing to 6°C in September 2010 (Gonzalez et al, 2012). At a depth of 1m, which was the burial depth of the HGHE, the temperature influence of the HGHE was observed to reach distances 8

up to 0.9m from the central long axis of the HGHE, which provides further evidence that a HGHE's soil temperature influence could be between 0.6m and 0.9m (Gonzalez et al, 2012). Researchers have investigated the penalty on GSHP efficiency related to HGHE-induced soil temperature changes, however; there is a lack of research into the effect that these changes in soil temperature would have on a building envelope, such as a basement foundation wall and basement slab. Installing a HGHE far from a building's foundation in order to minimize its effect on nearby soil temperature may seem like a good proposition, but in reality, the horizontal ground loops must often be placed in close proximity to the building envelope due to cost and space constraints. The following four points summarize the current situation:  Ground loop operation causes the soil temperature to deviate from expected seasonal soil temperature distributions (Gonzalez et al, 2012).  There is research assessing the impact that soil temperature changes, caused by HGHE operation, have on ground loop system efficiency (GarberSlaght & Daanen, 2014). However, there is a lack of research into the effect HGHE operation may have on a building's heat loss, possibly because GSHP efficiency can have more of an impact on a building's energy use.

Soil temperature changes result in a larger temperature difference between the indoor conditioned space and the surrounding soil, which would increase heat losses from the building (Rosenbaum, 2014).



Locating the ground loop further from the building envelope should reduce the ground loop's impact on soil temperature near the building envelope, however; typical spacing and cost constraints result in the need for ground loops to be installed near foundation walls (Zheng, Zhang, Liang, & Qian, 2013).

The aim of this research is to determine the additional building heat loss induced by the operation of a ground loop at various distances from a foundation wall.

2.2 Development of the Simulation Methodology and Model
This Section will provide details of the literature which resulted in the development of the methodology outlined in Section 3. The research will use a simulation based approach using HEAT3, a three-dimensional steady-state and transient heat transfer software. The model will be capable of accounting for ground loop operation, environmental conditions, building envelope, and soil properties. A simplified numerical and analytical model was utilized by Selamat, Miyara, and Kariya (2016) to optimize several different HGHE design arrangements. It 10

used 3D CFD models to carry out the analysis. Some of the simplifications included: the pipe wall modeled having zero thickness thus generated by the CFD solving process, a temperature boundary condition with a varying heat flux was imposed on the surface, adiabatic boundary conditions were applied to all four far field boundaries, and the bottom boundary had a geothermal heat flux of 65 mW/m2 assigned. The geothermal heat flux boundary condition will be similar to a constant temperature boundary condition since deep soil temperatures are predictable and constant. It was later observed that the heat flow from the HGHE did not exceed 0.8m nor did it reach either the far field boundaries or the bottom boundary. However, it was noted by Rosen and Koohi-Fayegh (2017) that soil temperature effects of the HGHE was observed up to 17m away from the source, which is why the model used in this currently discussed research has far-field boundaries up to 30m away. Selamat, Miyara, and Kariya (2016) noted that the simplified model would penalize the accuracy of the CFD solution, however; the approach would be adequate in providing a comparison between the various test cases. This MRP will use a simplified analytical approach since the model should be sufficiently accurate when used as a comparative tool.

3 Methodology
The software used to conduct the simulations detailed in this research was HEAT3, which is a three-dimensional steady-state and transient heat transfer software. HEAT3 was selected over other software such as TRNSYS

(www.trnsys.com), ANSYS Fluent (www.ansys.com/Products/Fluids/ANSYS-Fluent), and GLD (Ground Loop Design) [www.groundloopdesign.com] for a variety of reasons. ANSYS Fluent focuses more on the fluid behavior within the ground loop, which was not of interest in this research. GLD, TRNSYS, and other GSHP design software were not selected because these programs focus on the ground loop design aspect, including number of loops, loop configurations (slinky versus horizontal), loop placement, and pipe size. These specialized programs are used to size the equipment of the system to meet a specified heating load. The main advantage of HEAT3 is that it's a generalist software which allows the whole system to be evaluated, and it allowed for the monitoring of building heat loss to be focused on. The ground loop heat flux was calculated using the method outlined in Section 3.2.3, which is all a GSHP design software would have been needed for in this specific application.

3.1 Experimental Variables to Consider
The four major components of the overall system which affect or are affected by soil temperature are the environment, soil type, ground loop, and building 12

enclosure. The system is affected by the individual parameters of each component. In general, the environment and ground loop affect the soil temperature, which in turn affects the building's heat loss or gains. Several important environmental variables that impact soil temperature were presented by Gonzalez et al. (2012) who attributed natural shallow (less than 3m depth) soil temperature variations to incident solar radiation, fluctuations in air temperature, type and density of vegetative cover, and rainfall. Gonzalez et al. (2012) discovered that vegetation growth in the spring could result in a soil temperature difference of 2°C between soil with and without vegetation growth. This was re-affirmed by Pauli, Neuberger, and Adamovsky (2016) who determined that environmental conditions such as solar radiation intensity and daytime and nighttime radiation heat exchange between the Earth's surface and the sky played an important role on shallow soil temperatures. Further additional findings by Hepburn, Sedighi, Thomas, and Manju (2016) attributed soil temperature variations to the ambient environment's relative humidity and wind speed. A review of the literature indicated that soil properties have the biggest impact on the thermal response of the soil. Gonzalez et al. (2012) showed that variations in soil temperature are a function of soil textural composition (i.e. proportions of sand, clay, and silt) and soil thermal properties such as heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and heat diffusivity. Further, the moisture 13

content of the soil, which is determined by rainfall, evapotranspiration, and soil hydraulic properties (i.e. properties affecting infiltration, drainage, and runoff) will also exhibit a strong effect on the soil's thermal properties. In addition, Hepburn, Sedighi, Thomas, and Manju (2016) attributed a soil's temperature profile to soil density, porosity, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. An experimental test performed by Neuberger, Adamovsky, and Sed'ova (2014) showed that the primary variable affecting the heat transfer in a soil was the thermal conductivity of the soil. The test also showed that thermal conductivity was most affected by moisture content. The tested thermal conductivities for a dry soil, regular soil, and wet soil were 0.6 W/m·K, 2.3 W/m·K, and 2.7 W/m·K respectively. Frozen soils were shown to have a higher thermal conductivity than soils above 0 °C, with results showing that frozen clay soil had a thermal conductivity of 2.454 W/m·K compared to 1.616 W/m·K for clay soil above 0 °C. The overall heat transfer from the ground, which will affect soil temperature, is also influenced by the characteristics of the ground loop. Selamat, Miyara, and Kariya (2016) have shown that higher rates of heat transfer occur with slinky-type loops compared to straight horizontal loops due to increased contact area and turbulent fluid flow. In addition, Hepburn, Sedighi, Thomas, and Manju (2016) showed that system flow rate and specific heat capacity of the working fluid would also influence the heat transfer of the system. Other 14

variables proven to affect the heat transfer of the system are ground loop pipe diameter, length of piping, burial depth of pipe, spacing of the loops, working fluid density, and working fluid thermal conductivity, per findings by Neuberger, Adamovsky, and Sed'ova (2014). The final set of variables that must be considered are related to the building. The soil temperatures and distributions must be used in conjunction with details of the building envelope and conditioned space in order to determine the ground loop's impact on building heat loss. Details to consider are the envelope details and construction (i.e. type of insulation), and material properties such as thickness, thermal conductivity, resistance, specific heat capacity, and vapor permeability. A summary of all the variables presented in this Section are listed in Table 1.

As previously stated, the primary variable affecting heat transfer in the soil is the soil's thermal conductivity. The proposed research is not an investigation into how the various soil properties affect thermal conductivity, therefore, if the thermal conductivity of the soil is known, then knowing all other soil properties becomes less pertinent. For the environmental variables, solar radiation and air temperature are expected to be the main influencers of shallow depth ground temperature. Radiation exchange between the surface and sky could also have an impactful role. It is important to simplify the soil model as they can become quite complex. For the ground loop variables, it is expected that fluid flow rate, heat capacity, fluid temperature, and thermal conductivity will play the biggest role in determining the heat transfer of the system, and all ground loop variables listed in Table 1 should be considered. However, as will be shown in Section 3.2.3, the ground loop heat flux can be calculated using manufacturer provided data and specifications. As the research will focus on the impact to heat losses through the building envelope, all the building variables listed in Table 1 should be considered. HEAT3, a three-dimensional steady-state and transient heat transfer software, was used to conduct the simulations detailed in this research. The typical building typology for PHIUS is the single family detached home, which is what has driven the major simulation parameters of this research. As preheat ventilation air was the focus, Duluth, MN was selected as it is in climate zone 16

7. The three main components comprising the research methodology were the development of the model and inputs, testing of the model, and execution of the simulations. These components are discussed in further detail in Sections 3.2 to 3.4. The following Sections will refer to sides 1&2, 3&4, and 5 of the building. They are defined in Figure 1.

3.2 Development of the Model
The model was developed by understanding and selecting the input parameters required by the software, namely, the physical layout and geometry, the material and soil properties, expected ground loop heat fluxes, and boundary conditions. 3.2.1 Model Geometry and Layout As this research was of interest to PHIUS, many parameters, including the model geometry and layout were influenced by their main typology, the single family detached house. The model excluded everything form the building except the 17

basement foundation since the research focused on the interaction between the soil and the basement foundation walls. An exterior building footprint of 10m x 15m (150m2), equivalent to 134m2 of interior floor space was selected as this represents an average sized home in the United States (Perry, 2014). The building typology was selected to be a house with a basement foundation (rather than slab on grade) as changes in soil temperature would have the greatest thermal impact on this typology. The PHIUS recommended R-value of basement foundation walls in climate zone 7 is R-30, therefore, at R-5/inch, the thickness of the exterior insulation was set to 6 inches. The thickness of the concrete foundation walls was set to 8 inches, in line with typical foundation wall thickness requirements (FEMA, 2006). Finally, the interior ceiling height of the basement was set to 9 feet. With the physical dimensions of the building established, the next component of the model's geometry to be determined was the size of the surrounding land, which will be referred to as the test plot. Selamat, Miyara, and Kariya (2016) developed an analytical simulation model with a test plot size of 10m length x 10m width which allowed for the safe assumption that the temperature on the far-field boundaries would have no effect on the ground heat exchanger. The depth of their test plot was set to 5m since at this distance, the temperature can be assumed to be constant for short time analysis. After consultation with industry experts and the findings presented in Section 2.2, 18

it was decided that the test plot size for this research was to be increased to 75m long x 70m wide x 15m deep, which greatly exceeds the size used by Selamat, Miyara, and Kariya (2016). The larger test plot size provides additional assurance that assuming adiabatic conditions at the far-field boundaries is valid. Also, it has been shown that the ground temperature is constant at depths below 9m (Reysa, 2015). The test plot assumed there are no adjacent buildings nearby. Figure 2 and Figure 3 present the three main materials in the HEAT3

model, which are concrete (dark grey), soil (medium grey), and EPS insulation (light grey).

The brine geothermal heat exchanger equipment selected for this research was the Zehnder ComfoFond-L Eco 350 (data sheet provided in Appendix 7.1). This specific model was selected because it is suitable for residential applications, 21

is compatible with other Zehnder ERVs, and can be used in a variety of soil types such as sand, silt, loam, and clay. The relevant ground loop input parameters associated with the Zehnder ComfoFond-L Eco 350 specifications provided by the manufacturer are the following: pipe diameter of 3/4", single loop, and a burial depth of 1.2m (4 ft). After consultation with members of the PHIUS technical committee, it was agreed upon that based on their professional experience, a ground loop installation clearance of up to 200cm was typical. Therefore, to encompass a broad range of potential installations, the ground loop clearances, measured from edge of pipe to exterior insulation, were selected to be 10cm, 50cm, 100cm, and 200cm. 3.2.2 Material Properties The relevant input parameters for the concrete foundation and EPS insulation used in the simulation are provided in Table 2. The properties were retrieved from data provided by Hutcheon and Handegord (1995) as well as from the Owens Corning FOAMULAR® 150 product data sheet (provided in Appendix 7.2).

HEAT3 requires the input of the volumetric heat capacity (VHC), which is the product between density and specific heat capacity. To decrease computation 22

time and the overall length of this MRP, the number of simulation variables were reduced. To do so, only one set of typical properties for the concrete and EPS were selected, however, this was not the case for the soil properties. The comprehensive list of soil properties shown in Table 3 was data provided by Hamdhan and Clarke (2010). As observed, the soils have a broad range of densities (1390 to 2369 kg/m3), thermal conductivities (0.15 to 5.03 W/m·K), specific heat capacities (800 to 2646 J/kg·K), and volumetric heat capacities (1.11 to 4.37 MJ/m3·K).

The typical soil found in the Superior Area of Minnesota is composed of lacustrine deposits of silt and clay (Caine & Lyman, 1904). There are numerous streams flowing directly north into Lake Superior and the Nemadji River (Caine & Lyman, 1904). The number of streams combined with the agricultural potential of the soil would suggest the clay has relatively high moisture content, indicating it would have a high thermal conductivity soil. However, after the testing performed in Section 3.3.3 demonstrated that the building's heat loss greatly depends on the properties of the surrounding soil, it was decided that five soil types covering a broad range of soil properties be used in the analysis to ensure a more complete picture of the results was captured. Five discrete soil properties were selected from Table 3, covering a broad range of thermal conductivities and volumetric heat capacities. The soils covered the following ranges: soil 1 (low thermal conductivity, low volumetric heat capacity), soil 2 (high thermal conductivity, high volumetric heat capacity), soil 3 (low thermal conductivity, high volumetric heat capacity), soil 4 (high thermal conductivity, low volumetric heat capacity), and soil 5 (average thermal conductivity, average volumetric heat capacity). By using five soils to cover

24

a range of parameters, the number of variables and hence simulation time was greatly reduced. The soil properties used in this analysis that are provided in Table 4, were sourced from Table 3. Since the analysis was limited by five soil types, it was more beneficial to select soil properties based on actual results rather than a linear approach to allow for a greater diversity of soil properties to be tested in the analysis. Although Soil 1 and 3 were selected to have low thermal conductivities, it was only Soil 1 with a thermal conductivity of 0.25 W/(m·k), which showed the most observable trends. If Soil 1 and Soil 3 both had a thermal conductivity of 1.52 W/(m·k) rather than 0.25 W/(m·k), then the trends observed would have led to different or weaker conclusions. The drawback of the using actual soil results instead of a more linear approach is that the effect of volumetric heat capacity couldn't be fairly compared. If Soil 1 and 3 had the same thermal conductivity, but two different volumetric heat capacities, then the effect of varying volumetric heat capacity could accurately be compared.

3.2.3 Ground Loop Heat Flux This Section details the methodology used to estimate the ground loop heat flux based on the outside air temperature. The relevant specifications for the geothermal recovery unit used in this research are summarized in Table 5 (data sheet is provided in Appendix 7.1).
Table 5: Zehnder ComfoFond-L Eco 350 specifications

The manufacturer's data sheet also provided two sample operating cases of the geothermal recovery unit (GRU), which provided the information required to calculate the heat transfer rate under those specific conditions. The two sample operating cases provided in addition to the density and specific heat capacity of air at the corresponding conditions are presented in Table 6.
Table 6: Sample operating case conditions provided by manufacturer

Winter
6.5 °C -12 °C 3 250 m /hr 0.718 kJ/(kg·K) 3 1.34 kg/m @ -10 °C

26

The heat transfer rate was calculated using the following equation:

Q = cT
Where, Q = heat transfer rate [W]  = mass flow rate of air [kg/s]

[1]

c = specific heat capacity of air [J/(kg·K)]

T = temperature difference of supply and outside air [°C]

The heat fluxes for the summer and winter operating cases were calculated to be 1028 W and -1237 W respectively. It was assumed that the maximum pre-cool capacity of 1864 W was for the maximum GRU operating temperature of +45 °C and that the maximum pre-heat capacity of -1961 W was for the minimum GRU operating temperature of -22 °C. These four heat fluxes and outdoor air temperatures were used to interpolate the supply air temperatures corresponding to outdoor air temperatures within the -22 °C to +45 °C operating range of the GRU. The temperature difference between the outside air temperature and interpolated supply air temperature, along with the mass flow rate and specific heat capacity of air were used to calculate the heat fluxes of the ground loop at various outside air temperatures. The calculated heat fluxes are shown in Table 7.

To summarize, the bolded values in columns, A, C, M, and P of Table 7 were provided by the manufacturer and subsequently used to interpolate all other values in the Table. The outside air temperature was chosen at 5 °C increments between the -22 °C to +45 °C operating range of the GRU. Columns A and C were used to interpolate column B, columns C and M were used to interpolate columns D to L, and columns M and P were used to interpolate columns N and O. To calculate the ground loop heat flux, Equation 1 was used along with the interpolated supply air temperature and assumed air flow rate of 250 m3/hr.

3.2.4 Boundary Conditions The model contains the following three types of boundary conditions: imposed temperature (allows for temperature variance over time), constant temperature (constant with time), and adiabatic (no heat transfer). These three types of boundary conditions were applied to the model as follows: 1) The test plot's four far field boundaries and building's basement foundation wall to first floor wall interface had adiabatic boundary conditions applied. This assumed no other heat sources or sinks were within an appreciable distance to affect the results. 2) The interior walls and floor of the building had a constant temperature boundary condition of 21°C applied. 3) The test plot's bottom boundary had a constant temperature boundary condition of 3.9°C applied, which is the temperature of the soil at a depth of 30 feet in Duluth, MN (Reysa, 2015). 4) The test plot's top boundary, the soil to air interface, had an imposed temperature boundary condition applied. The boundary condition used the TMY2 climate data file for Duluth, MN which allowed for the temperature to vary throughout the year on a daily basis. This assumed that the temperature at the soil's surface was the same as the outside air temperature.

29

The applied boundary conditions are shown in Figure 6 to Figure 8.

3.3 Testing of the Model
The completed HEAT3 model was subjected to various tests to determine when steady state would be reached, what mesh size was optimal, and if multiple soil types were necessary. 3.3.1 Steady State Testing The HEAT3 model was tested to determine when steady state soil temperatures would be reached for two cases: test site without a ground loop and test site with a ground loop. To ensure the analysis produced reliable results, it was important to first reach steady state without the ground loop, then to reach steady state again with the ground loop. Table 8 shows the heat loss of sides 1 to 5 for the test site without the influence of a ground loop. As can be

31

observed, the change in heat loss is essentially 0% between years 14 and 15. This indicates that steady state soil temperatures are reached by year 15.

Table 9 shows the heat loss of side 1 to 5 for the test site with the influence of a ground loop. According to NPARC (2008), iterative convergence can be considered to have occurred when the results begin to converge. The convergence criteria is defined by acceptable error in these values, which should be selected by the user (NPARC, 2008). As can be observed in Table 9, the change in heat loss is less than 5% between years 4 and 5. Based on the nature of this analysis, this author has deemed that using an acceptable error of 5% will provide sufficient accuracy in the results. Assuming the ground loop heat flux does not vary year to year, then steady state soil temperatures will be reached by year 5.

3.3.2 Mesh Size Optimization In HEAT3, the numerical mesh can be automatically generated by specifying the number of computational cells per element, Ni. The computational cell count can vary from a minimum of Ni = 20 to a maximum of Ni = 130. The number of computational cells are applied in an equidistant manner in each direction of the element. Like other finite element software, smaller mesh sizes (i.e. a higher number of computational cells) will result in more accurate results as well as longer computation times. The purpose of the testing in this section was to determine the minimum amount of computation cells per element that would provide sufficiently accurate results, thereby avoiding unnecessary

computational load. As observed in Table 10, the percent change in results from Ni = 80 to Ni = 100 is less than 1%, which indicated that a cell count larger than Ni = 100 was not necessary.

3.3.3 Soil Properties Sensitivity Test The two soil properties that must be input into the HEAT3 model are thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity (i.e. the product of the density and specific heat capacity). This soil test was conducted to determine if using one soil type in the analysis would be satisfactory in providing sufficient result quality. As there are countless different soil types and combinations of soil types, it was important to reduce the number of soils used in the analysis to decrease computation time. Table 11 provides the input parameters of eight test soils, which were used to determine how much variance in the results they would cause.

Eight simulations were run while holding all parameters constant except the soil type. The minimum and maximum heat losses of side 1 of the building over a 15-year simulation period are presented in Table 12. The maximum heat loss observed ranged from 153.5 W to 246.5 W and the minimum heat loss observed ranged from 23.8 W to 36.5 W. The large variance in results showed that soil 34

type can have a significant impact on the heat loss of the building, which is why the decision was made to use five soil types to cover the following ranges in the analysis: soil 1 (low thermal conductivity, low volumetric heat capacity), soil 2 (high thermal conductivity, high volumetric heat capacity), soil 3 (low thermal conductivity, high volumetric heat capacity), soil 4 (high thermal conductivity, low volumetric heat capacity), and soil 5 (average thermal conductivity, average volumetric heat capacity).

Test soils 1 to 4 had thermal conductivity varied while holding the volumetric heat capacity constant while test soils 5 to 8 had thermal conductivity held constant and volumetric heat capacity varied. As observed in Table 12, there is more variance in the maximum heat losses for test soils 1 to 4 compared to test soils 5 to 8, indicating that thermal conductivity has a bigger impact on heat loss than volumetric heat capacity. This resulted in the research focusing on the effect of thermal conductivity rather than volumetric heat capacity.

The independent variables are the soil type (five different types) and ground loop clearance from the foundation wall (four different clearances). The manipulated and fixed variables amounted to twenty different cases. The dependent variable in the simulation is the building heat loss. The transient simulation function of HEAT3 had one major limitation. Unlike the surface temperature boundary condition which uses a TMY2 file as a 36

time step function to vary temperature over time, the ground loop heat flux could not be input as a time step function, preventing automated daily variation. Instead, the ground loop heat flux had to be manually input every time there was a change in heat flux. Manually changing the heat flux daily over a 5-year simulation period for twenty cases would result in 36,500 input changes. To reduce the number of changes, it was decided that the ground loop heat flux would be changed on a weekly basis instead. This reduced the total number of simulation input changes down to 5,200. To determine the weekly ground loop heat flux, the average weekly outdoor air temperature in Duluth was matched with the corresponding expected ground heat fluxes previously presented in Table 7 of Section 3.2.3. The average outdoor temperature and weekly expected ground heat fluxes for all 52 weeks of the year in Duluth are presented in Table 13.

The simulation on a per case basis was performed as such: 1) A 15-year simulation with no ground loop was first performed to reach steady state soil temperatures in the model. 2) The ground loop was placed in the model at the specified ground loop clearance and depth. 3) The week 1 ground loop heat flux was then input (i.e. -1141 W). 4) The simulation time period was set as day 0 to day 7 (i.e. week 1). 5) The simulation was run with the results automatically being recorded. 38

6) Steps 3 to 5 were repeated for the next week (i.e. week 2 with a ground loop heat flux of -1488 W and time period of day 7 to day 14). 7) Step 6 was repeated until 3 simulation years were completed. If the percent change in results between year 2 and 3 were below 5%, the simulation was considered complete. If the percent change was above 5%, the simulation was continued until the year to year percent change in results was below 5%. The time to reach steady state for all cases varied between 3 to 5 years and depended mainly on the soil properties. 8) Steps 1 to 7 were completed for all twenty test cases. (i.e. case 1 is soil 1 with a ground loop clearance of 10cm and case 2 is soil 1 with a ground loop clearance of 50cm, etc). A listing of all simulation cases are presented in Table 14.

4 Results and Discussion
The heat transfer losses and gains for all five interior surfaces of the building were recorded for every simulation case. The source data can be found in Appendix 7.3. Due to the building's rectangular shape, only 3 unique results are presented since sides 1 and 2 and sides 3 and 4 are identical. Figure 10 provides the identifiers for each interior surface.

Several observations from the results presented in Figure 11 to Figure 30 can be made. First, the thermal conductivity of the soil impacts the effect that the ground loop clearance has on the building's heat loss. The soils with a higher thermal conductivity have narrower gaps in heat flux between the various ground loop clearances (i.e. trend lines are compressed closer). Arranging soils 1 to 5 from highest to lowest thermal conductivity results in the following order: soil 2, soil 4, soil 5, soil 3, then soil 1. This is the same order in terms of narrowest heat flux gap between ground loop clearances to largest heat flux gap (i.e. low effect to high effect of ground loop clearance), indicating a correlation between thermal conductivity and the ground loop clearance's impact on heat flux. A high thermal conductivity soil will reduce the effect that the ground loop clearance has on the building's heat loss. The opposite is true for a soil with low thermal conductivity. As shown in Table 15 and Table 16, for a ground loop clearance of 10cm, the building's highest average heat loss of 10.0 W/m2 for sides 1&2 and 7.5 W/m2 for sides 3&4 occurs with soil 1, which has the lowest thermal conductivity. Conversely, the building's lowest average heat loss of 4.2 W/m2 for sides 1&2 and 3.9 W/m2 for sides 3&4 occurs with soil 2, which has the highest thermal conductivity. At a ground loop clearance of 10cm, the building's heat loss is shown to have a direct correlation with thermal conductivity. Although this result may seem counterintuitive, the reason for this correlation could be due 51

to the close-proximity ground loop reducing the temperature of the soil directly adjacent to the foundation wall. The insulative surrounding soil (i.e. low thermal conductivity) inhibits the adjacent soil's ability to be recharged by the outdoor air and stable temperature soil below. This results in the adjacent soil temperatures remaining low, which has the overall effect of increased building heat losses. See Figure 31 for a schematic representation. Conversely, it can be viewed that the soil with high thermal conductivity allows heat escaping the building to more freely travel in various directions, thus less of it reaching the ground loop.

For 10cm clearance cases with high thermal conductivity soils, the soil temperature adjacent to the building can recharge quicker, leading to overall higher soil temperatures at the foundation wall and reduced building heat loss. 52

The average soil 1 building heat loss at clearances of 10cm, 50cm, and 100cm is greater than the average for soils 2 to 5. For sides 1&2, and all soils, the average building heat loss at a 10cm, 50cm, and 100cm clearance varies between 4.2 W/m2-10.0 W/m2, 3.9 W/m2-7.3 W/m2, and 3.8 W/m2-5.4 W/m2 respectively. This indicates that the soil type has an impact on the ground loop clearance's effectiveness on reducing building heat loss. However, for a clearance of 200cm, the average heat loss for soil 1 is essentially equal to the heat loss of soils 2 to 5. At a 200cm clearance, the average building heat loss for all soils varies between 3.5 W/m2-3.6 W/m2, which indicates that soil type has a limited impact on the ground loop clearance's effectiveness on reducing building heat

53

loss when the ground loop clearance is 200cm. The same trends for sides 1&2 are observed for sides 3&4. Comparing soil 1 to soils 2 to 5, it is observed that the average building heat loss significantly drops as ground loop clearance is increased, indicating it is more beneficial for low thermal conductivity soils to have ground loops with greater clearances. In all cases, the building heat loss reduces with increasing ground loop clearance. The second observation from Figure 11 to Figure 30, is that for all soil types, the trend line spacing between the 200cm ground loop clearance case and the no ground loop case is narrow, which indicates that the ground loop's influence on the building's heat loss is minimal when the ground loop is placed 200cm away. On average, the ground loop with a 200cm clearance increased the building's heat losses by 15% on sides 1&2 and by 12% on sides 3&4. Conversely, a ground loop with a 10cm clearance, on average, increased the building's heat losses by 83% on sides 1&2 and by 59% on sides 3&4. The average building heat loss increase for a 50cm clearance ground loop was 55% for sides 1&2 and 40% for sides 3&4. For a 100cm clearance ground loop, the average building heat loss was increased by 35% for sides 1&2 and 26% for sides 3&4. The heat loss percent increase, with no ground loop present as the baseline, for all four clearances and all five soil types for sides 1 through 4 are presented in Table 17 and Table 18.

It can be observed that the soils with a higher thermal conductivity (i.e. soils 2 and 4) have the lowest percent heat loss increase compared to the soils with lower thermal conductivities (i.e. soils 1, 3, and 5). This indicates that ground loop clearance is more critical for soils with lower thermal conductivity than for soils with higher thermal conductivity. In all soil cases, the percent heat loss increase decreases with increasing ground loop clearance. The third observation from Figure 11 to Figure 30 is that for all soil cases, the summer time building heat flux is nearly identical for all ground loop clearances, as well as the no ground loop case. This is most likely due to the low ground loop heat fluxes during weeks 20 to 40 having less of an effect 55

on the soil temperature than the outdoor air temperature. As previously noted, the low thermal conductivity soils (i.e. soil 1 and 3) produce trend line results with larger heat flux gaps between the ground loop clearances. For these soil types, the effect of increasing the ground loop clearance from 10cm to 50cm (40cm increase) on building heat flux is greater than the effect from increasing ground loop clearance from 50cm to 100cm (50cm increase). The ground loop clearance increase from 50cm to 100cm has a greater effect on building heat flux than the ground loop clearance increase from 100cm to 200cm (100cm increase). This indicates that initial ground loop clearance increases are the most important in terms of heat loss increase reduction. The soil cases with higher thermal conductivities (i.e. soil 2, soil 4, and soil 5) show that increasing the ground loop clearance from 10cm to 50cm, 50cm to 100cm, and 100cm to 200cm all reduce the heat flux by relatively the same amount on a percentage reduction basis. Figure 32 to Figure 41 represent the heat loss of side 5, which is the building's slab. Soil 1's heat loss trendlines for the 10cm, 50cm, 100cm, and 200cm ground loop clearances show more variance from the no ground loop case compared to soils 2 to 5, however, the side 5 heat loss is the lowest for soil 1. Soil 1's no ground loop trendline is relatively flat throughout the year, indicating that the outdoor air temperature has negligible effect on the soil temperature under the slab due to the low thermal conductivity of the soil.

soils 2, 4, and 5, the trendlines between the 10cm, 50cm, 100cm, and 200cm ground loop clearances and the no ground loop case were relatively similar, differing by only 5% to 13%. For soil 3, the difference varied by 12% to 22%. The most significant increase in heat loss associated with the ground loop occurred for soil 1, with a heat loss increase varying between 68% to 109%. Table 19 provides the heat loss percent increase for side 5 of the building.

Table 20 provides the average building heat losses of side 5 for soils 1 to 5. For soils 2 to 5, there is minimal variation in heat loss between a 10cm and 200cm ground loop clearance, with heat losses ranging from 2.8 - 3.1 W/m2 to 2.6 - 3.0 W/m2. The variation between a 10cm and 200cm ground loop clearance for soil 1 is 0.4 W/m2, however, the average heat loss is lower than all other soils.

Figure 42 and Figure 43 represent the normalized heat loss of sides 1&2 and sides 3&4 respectively. The normalized results were produced by subtracting the baseline heat loss values of the no ground loop case from the heat loss values at ground loop clearances of 10cm, 50cm, 100cm, 200cm. Therefore, the results shown are the increase in building heat loss caused by the addition of a ground loop at the four clearances. The effect of increasing the ground loop clearance for the higher thermal conductivity soils (soils 2, 4, and 5) is minimal. Ground loop clearance has a minor impact for soil 3 (low thermal conductivity) and a very significant impact for soil 1 (lowest thermal conductivity).

The side 5 trend lines shown in Figure 44 are flatter than those shown for sides 1&2 and 3&4. This indicates that the distance of the ground loop has a more limited effect on the heat loss of side 5 than on any other side. The flatness of the trend lines also shows that the ground loop's influence on the soil temperature below side 5 is negligible.

5 Conclusions
Several conclusions can be drawn from the results presented in Section 4. The thermal conductivity of a building's surrounding soil has a large impact on the effect that ground loop clearance has on building heat loss. Soil thermal conductivity can range from a low of 0.15 W/m·K to a high of 5.0 W/m·K. For a low thermal conductivity soil, the building heat loss percent increase from a ground loop at a 10cm clearance versus a ground loop at a 200cm clearance decreases from 356% to 61%, which is a difference of 295%. For a medium thermal conductivity soil, the heat loss percent increase decreases from 67% to 12%, which is a difference of 55%. Lastly, for a high thermal conductivity soil, the heat loss percent increase decreases from 26% to 5%, which is a 21% decrease. These results show that increasing ground loop clearance is more effective in reducing increases in building heat loss for soils with low thermal

conductivities than for soils with high thermal conductivities. For all ranges of soil thermal conductivity, increasing ground loop clearance reduced the building percent heat loss increase associated with the operation of the ground loop. On average, the percent heat loss increase of the building decreased from 59%-83% (10cm clearance) to 40%-55% (50cm clearance) to 26%-35% (100cm clearance) to 12%-15% (200cm clearance). For ground loop clearances of 10cm, 50cm, and 100cm, the average building heat loss was shown 66

to be directly correlated to the thermal conductivity of the surrounding soil. A low thermal conductivity soil led to higher observed building heat losses caused by the operation of the ground loop. For the case of no ground loop, the high thermal conductivity soils led to higher observed building heat losses. At a 200cm ground loop clearance, the average building heat loss of sides 1&2 and 3&4 was essentially the same for all soil types. This indicated that at a ground loop clearance of 200cm, the correlation between soil thermal conductivity and building heat loss decouples and that soil thermal properties become less influential on the building heat losses observed. Low thermal conductivity soils were shown to have a greater benefit to reducing building heat loss by increasing ground loop clearance than did higher thermal conductivity soils. Soils 1 and 3 had average decreases in building heat losses from 7.5-10 W/m2 to 3.1-3.5 W/m2 and 4.6-5.2 W/m2 to 3.4-3.5 W/m2 respectively. Whereas soils 2, 4, and 5 had decreases in average building heat losses of 3.9-4.2 W/m2 to 3.5-3.6 W/m2, 3.9-4.3 W/m2 to 3.5-3.6 W/m2, and 4.1-4.6 W/m2 to 3.4-3.6 W/m2 respectively. Therefore, more emphasis should be placed on ensuring higher ground loop clearances for any installation locations with lower thermal conductivity soils. On average, a ground loop with a 10cm clearance increased the building's heat losses by 83% on sides 1&2, by 59% on sides 3&4, and by 20% on side 5. A

67

ground loop at 50cm clearance led to a building heat loss increase of 55% for sides 1&2, 40% for sides 3&4, and 19% on side 5. For a 100cm clearance, the average building heat loss increase was 35% for sides 1&2, 26% for sides 3&4, and 16% for side 5. Finally, for the 200cm ground loop clearance, the average increase in building heat loss for sides 1&2, sides 3&4, and side 5 was 15%, 12%, and 12% respectively. A building's overall heat loss increase resulting from a 200cm clearance ground loop would be minimal in a big picture scale once all other building envelope heat losses are considered. Soils with a higher thermal conductivity (i.e. soils 2, 4, and 5) have the lowest percent heat loss increase compared to the soils with lower thermal conductivities (i.e. soils 1 and 3). In all soil cases, the percent heat loss increase decreases with increasing ground loop clearance. For low thermal conductivity soils, the effect of increasing the ground loop clearance from 10cm to 50cm (40cm increase) on building heat loss is greater than the effect from increasing ground loop clearance from 50cm to 100cm (50cm increase). The ground loop clearance increase from 50cm to 100cm has a greater effect on building heat loss than the ground loop clearance increase from 100cm to 200cm (100cm increase). This indicates that the initial increase in ground loop clearance is the most beneficial in terms of reducing the increase in building heat loss caused by the operation of the ground loop. The heat loss reduction effect of increasing the ground loop clearance for the high thermal conductivity 68

soils (soils 2, 4, and 5) is minimal. Ground loop clearance has a minor impact for soil 3 (low thermal conductivity) and a very significant impact for soil 1 (lowest thermal conductivity).

5.1 Future Work
The overall goal of this research was to obtain preliminary findings to begin the process of developing a guideline for prescribing ground loop clearance from foundation walls. However, in order to develop a complete and robust guideline, additional work to expand on the preliminary findings will be necessary. The majority of the recommended additional work will be an expansion of the current findings. This includes testing additional locations, soil types, and ground loop clearances. By testing locations in different climate zones, more robust data can be obtained for ground loop clearances since results will be obtained from both heating and cooling dominated climates. Although five soil types were tested, the variance in soil properties is so great that testing more types will help in obtaining stronger data, which can be used for further validation and confirmation of the observed trends. It is also recommended that further analysis into the effect that a soil's volumetric heat capacity has on building heat loss. This can be done by keeping the thermal conductivity of the test soils constant and varying the volumetric heat capacity. Furthermore, 69

testing additional ground loop clearances within the 10cm to 200cm range will reduce the amount of interpolation between data points. Again, this will lead to a stronger set of data to which conclusions can be drawn. It would also be beneficial to determine the ground loop clearance at which no increased building heat loss is observed. The method used to calculate the weekly ground loop heat fluxes was done to obtain reasonable values. However, it would be advantageous if a more precise method was developed to determine the expected daily ground loop heat fluxes. With the daily values calculated, the simulations can be run on a per day basis rather than a weekly basis. This would allow for more accurate results. In summary, the intention of all recommended future work is to obtain stronger data to which an overall guideline for ground loop to foundation wall clearance can be developed.

5.2 Limitations
One of the major limitations of this research was the assumption of constant thermal conductivity for the test soil throughout the entire period of analysis. In reality, the thermal conductivity of the soil could vary quite significantly on a daily or weekly basis. The factor having the greatest impact on thermal conductivity is the moisture content of the soil. Wetter soils will have a much higher thermal conductivity than a drier soil, even if their soil composition 70

is identical. For example, a dry fine sand could have a thermal conductivity of 1.28 W/(m·k) compared to a wet fine sand, which could have a thermal conductivity of 3.28 W/(m·k), an increase of 2.6 times. Soil temperature will also affect the thermal conductivity. Soils at temperatures below 0 °C will have a higher thermal conductivity than the same soil at temperatures above 0 °C. Another limitation was the assumption that the thermal conductivity of the soil was the same for the entire test plot. The majority of on-site soils are nonhomogenous, meaning there could be significant variance in its mineral composition. The variance in mineral composition would lead to non-uniform thermal properties of the soil surrounding the building, which would lead to Sides 1 through 5 of the building experiencing non-symmetrical heat loss. Also, intermittent environmental conditions such as rain and sunshine will cause the moisture content and temperature distribution of the soil to vary in a nonuniform way, only to be amplified by the heat flux of the ground loop. A limitation regarding the ground loop was the assumption that the ground loop had the same constant output along the entire loop. In reality, the ground loop experiences a transient heat flux based on changing fluid and soil temperatures. The charging or de-charging of the loop into the ground would result in a variance in soil and fluid temperature along the ground loop, resulting in a non-uniform heat flux output along the ground loop. For example, the circulated refrigerant would be at its lowest temperature at the outlet of 71

the fluid to air heat exchanger, which is the beginning of the loop. Initially the temperature difference between the soil and fluid would be greatest, leading to a high rate of heat transfer. However, the soil temperature would eventually decrease and approach the temperature of the fluid, leading to reduced rates of heat transfer. Additionally, the method for calculating the weekly ground loop heat flux as well as using the average weekly ground loop heat flux rather than an hourly or daily value led to an inaccuracy in the results. Using a GSHP design software could aid in the more accurate calculation of the ground loop heat flux. It is the opinion of the author that although the results may have inaccuracies, the general trends observed would most likely remain true. On a high level, it can be presumed to be true that ground loops will affect soil temperature and therefore building heat loss. This highlights the importance of organizations such as PHIUS needing to develop a guideline for ground loop to foundation wall clearance to ensure the benefits of preheating ventilation air are not outweighed by the resulting increase in building heat loss.
