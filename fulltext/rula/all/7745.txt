Abstract
Evaluating the Use of Straw Bales in Achieving Passive House Certification (PHIUS+ 2015) in Western Canada Master of Building Science, 2018 Ashley Lubyk, Ryerson University Achieving Passive House certification requires superinsulation which can significantly raise the embodied energy and carbon footprint of a project, effectively front-end loading the climate impact, especially where petrochemical foam-based products are used. This research sought to evaluate the use of straw bales - a low embodied energy, carbon sequestering agricultural by-product - to achieve PHIUS+2015 certification. A straw bale wall system was adapted to a single-family detached reference house designed to meet the Passive House standard. The wall system was evaluated for applicability across three Western Canadian cities using WUFI Passive energy simulation software to evaluate compliance; thermal bridging and hygrothermal performance were also evaluated. It was found that the proposed straw bale wall assembly satisfied the PHIUS+ 2015 requirements in all three locations - Saskatoon, Calgary, and Kelowna - with only minor changes required to the reference house design. The annual heating demand and peak heating load, the two targets most sensitive to design changes, were, respectively, 4% and 8.6% below the target in Saskatoon, 63.1% and 21.3% below in Calgary, and 63.1% and 32.6% below in Kelowna. The research also revealed that maintaining a high degree of air tightness is essential for satisfying the requirements. Overall, this research demonstrates that straw bales can be a beneficial component in creating high performance enclosures without exacting a large embodied carbon footprint.

1.0 Introduction
1.1 Introduction To secure a safe, reliable and low carbon energy future, it is crucial that there be major improvements to the energy performance of Canada's housing stock. Residential buildings in Canada account for 17% of final energy consumption across all uses (Natural Resources Canada, 2014), and represent 55% of energy used by buildings (Natural Resources Canada, 2016), revealing a significant opportunity for reducing energy consumption and related greenhouse gas emissions through energy conservation measures. Space heating, which makes up 63% of residential energy consumption (Natural Resources Canada, 2017), is of particular consequence when designing `low energy' housing. Only recently have specific energy efficiency requirements found their way into local building codes - through the adoption of Section 9.36. of the National Building Code of Canada - but these requirements are minimal by other international precedents, where `near' or `at' net-zero energy consumption housing is becoming status quo (Yip & Richman, 2015). Indeed, the National Research Council (2016, June 14) estimates that adopting Section 9.36. will yield energy savings of 10-20% over that of 2009 construction but still a long way off what would be required to reasonably achieve netzero housing. By some estimates, an 80% reduction in heating energy use is better aligned with meeting the net-zero target (Yip & Richman, 2015), which, in the short term at least, will be achieved by following the `performance path' permitted by the standard, and likely through one of the voluntary energy performance programs offered in Canada. One of the most aggressive energy conservation programs is Passivhaus, a voluntary certification scheme that originated in Germany in the early 1990s, and later adopted to the North American context by PHIUS (Passive House Institute US). Certified homes have an annual space heating demand that is upwards of 90% lower than for a

1

conventional house (Passive House Institute US , 2017). This is primarily achieved through superinsulation, air tightness, and thermal bridge-free construction techniques. While the certification is proven in its ability to drastically reduce operational energy demands, setting strict limits on heating demands for instance, some evidence suggests that the extra materials needed to achieve such high performance, especially the high amounts of insulation needed, may exact a high embodied energy cost on a project and thus counter-balancing the operational savings (Stephan, Crawford, & Myttenaere, 2013). Seeing that climate stabilization is a major driver for PHIUS (and for many of the other energy efficiency standards and policies), and the founding pillar of the original Passive House standard, efforts to limit embodied energy are imperative, especially as these energy costs are front loaded on a project, creating an energy and emissions deficit amortized over the life of a project. Even if balanced over time, the scientific community stresses that emission reductions are needed now, not in 20 years. As such, low embodied energy materials, and perhaps those capable of sequestering carbon, will best be able to reduce emissions now and in the future. One potential insulation material that may satisfy these needs is straw bales - an agricultural by-product that has been used as wall insulation in buildings for more than 125 years. An optimized straw bale wall system will be presented and adapted to a single- family detached reference house designed to meet the Passive House Standard. It will be evaluated for applicability across three Western Canadian cities - Saskatoon, Calgary, and Kelowna - using WUFI Passive energy simulation software. The results will demonstrate the effectiveness of using straw bales in achieving Passive House certification in Western Canada. 1.2 Background Cereal straw - a byproduct of grain cultivation, including wheat, rye, flax, barley and rice - is a ubiquitous, renewable and low embodied energy resource that, when baled, serves as a useful `building block' with high levels of thermal insulation (a 360mm to 460mm thick plastered straw bale wall has a thermal resistance of approximately RSI5.28 m2K/W (14 to 18 inches results in approximately R-30). The atmospheric carbon

2

captured through a plant's lifecycle is locked within its tissues and is sequestered within the walls of a building over the life of the project. These seemingly rudimentary bales produced by a machine that has changed little in 120 years are increasingly being used in novel ways in contemporary architecture worldwide, with projects in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australasia, Japan and China (Magwood, Mack, & Therrien, 2005; Holzhueter, 2010). Typical 2-string bales are 360mm x 460mm x 889mm to 1016mm, weighing 18 to 23 kg (Figure 1), offering a relatively speedy and low-tech building technique that requires few specialized tools or skills. But unlike most construction materials that are standardized, uniform, and modular by design, packaged in a form that is optimized for easy construction or easily manipulated for flexible arrangement, straw bales are best used intact; cutting, notching, and shaping bales is challenging and time consuming. Well executed designs seek to design around the bale module, maximizing the use of full bales, and thus resulting in a more buildable and efficient design.

Figure 1: Typical 2-String Bale Dimensions (Wilson, 1995)

Whilst there are many positive attributes associated with using straw bales in buildings, with a growing body of research demonstrating long-term durability where best practices are followed (more of this in Section 2.2), wall thickness is largely dictated by the bale dimensions. This means incremental additions of insulation to achieve thermal insulation values exceeding RSI- 5.28 m2K/W are not as straightforward as adding several more inches of straw, and adding a second bale width is for the most part

3

impractical. Creating a wall assembly that achieves the R-values recommended by PHIUS (RSI- 6.87 to 11.45 m2K/W for climate zones 6 and 7, which correspond to the select cities being studied), while still utilizing a typical 2-string straw bale, requires an approach that deviates from the typical straw bale building technique of stacking bales in a single width and plastering the bale face inside and out - what some have labeled a "first-generation" assembly (Graham, 2014).

1.3 Objectives The objective of this research is to determine how typical 2-string straw bales may be used within above-grade wall assemblies for single family dwellings seeking to achieve Passive House certification (PHIUS+ 2015). Computer simulation, informed by best practices revealed during the literature review, will be used to create an optimized assembly that will then be adapted to a detached single-family reference house in three Western Canadian cities - Saskatoon, Calgary, and Kelowna - to satisfy the Standard. 1.4 Problem Statement and Research Questions Although the PHIUS+ 2015 standard only focuses on reducing operational energy (Passive House Institute US , 2017), requirements for reducing the environmental and climate impacts associated with building materials and construction processes are on the rise. Architecture 2030, a leader in addressing the climate impact caused by the building industry, has called for zero carbon emissions by 2050 for all new construction, including both operational and embodied carbon (Architecture 2030, 2014). The use of cellulosic building materials, including straw bales, offers an important tool in the path towards zero carbon building. Yet, at the time of this writing, there are no PHIUS+ 2015certified projects built using straw bales (L. White, personal communication Nov 9, 2017). This research will enable a clearer understanding of how typical 2-string straw bales may be used to satisfy these rigorous performance standards. This project seeks to answer the following research questions: Â· Are typical 2-string straw bales suitable for creating super-insulated wall assemblies?

What is the configuration of the straw bale wall assembly and associated details that would satisfy Passive House certification (PHIUS+ 2015) in three Western Canadian cities - Saskatoon, Calgary, and Kelowna?

2.0 Literature Review
2.1 Passive House in North America The performance-driven Passive House standard (PHI) that originated in Germany under the direction of Dr. Wolfgang Feist during the early 1990's emphasized five basic principles - thermal insulation, Passive House windows, ventilation with heat recovery, airtightness, and a thermal-bridge-free design (Paquin-Bechard, n.d.). Along with a series of recommendations, the PHI standard sets a minimum airtightness target (Â£0.6ACH50), and limits primary energy consumption to Â£120 kWh/m2/year. It also established a strict annual space heating limit of 15 kWh/m2/year, regardless of where the building is located. Originally PHI partnered with Passive House Institute US (PHIUS) - the group that brought passive house principles to the US - but disagreements ensued over the appropriate approach for North America, where the climate is radically more variable than exists in continental Europe, not to mention the context for which building occurs (Paquin-Bechard, n.d.). PHIUS, working in partnership with the Building Science Corporation and the US Department of Energy, established a new standard with "climate-specific" targets tailored to their locale (Passive House Institute US , 2017). The latest iteration of this climate-specific standard is called PHIUS+ 2015 and its certification requirements are summarized in Table 1 (PHI requirements are included for comparison).

Since 2011, when PHIUS and PHI parted ways, there has been exponential growth in passive house certifications in the US, with PHIUS-certifications accounting for the bulk of the market share (Figure 2; Frappe-Seneclauze, Heerema, & Wu, 2016). This growth, according to Klingenberg (2017), indicates that the certification protocols and climatespecific targets were successful in removing barriers that hindered earlier adoption.

2.2 Recent Developments in Straw Bale Construction The main push for building with straw bales is the perceived environmental benefits. The combination of a low embodied energy/carbon and high insulation value material means that using straw bales can help reduce both embodied and operational energy/carbon by building with them. Offin (2010) found that a house built with a loadbearing straw bale assembly had the least embodied energy of all construction styles. Magwood (2015b) has published similar findings in relation to embodied carbon. Despite these benefits, Canada does not have provincial or national straw bale building codes, and those straw bale buildings that have been approved have done so on a case-by-case basis (ASRi, 2013). Anecdotal evidence suggests that professional builders have been met with resistance when attempting to obtain warranty insurance for straw bale homes, so those wishing to live in a straw bale home must apply for an owner-builder exemption, which carries its own risks and responsibilities (ASRi, 2013). A lack of standardized best practices, misconceptions regarding fire and seismic safety, and durability concerns, particularly relating to moisture, have been cited as barriers to mainstream adoption of straw bale building (ASRi, 2013; King, 2006; Holzhueter, 2010). Recently, though, the International Code Council (ICC) officially recognized straw bale construction with its inclusion of Appendix S in the 2015 International Residential Code (IRC) Â­ the basis for the residential building code in virtually every jurisdiction in the United States (The Institutes CPCU Society: Underwriting Interest Group, 2016). This is an important development and is a major step forward in the acknowledgement of straw bales as a suitable building material. Its inclusion in the IRC will hopefully make consumers, builders, lenders, insurers, and inspectors less leery of straw as a building material, thus increasing the number of permitted straw bale projects in the US. One can only hope that this development will raise awareness that will trickle north of the border.

2.2.1 Structure Straw bales can be used as a structural component in a building - structural loadbearing or structural shear wall - or simply as infill (ASRi, 2013). Variations of these are many and are well described in the Alternatives Solution Resource (ASRi, 2013), as well as in the various current books about straw bale construction (Magwood, 2005; Steen, Steen, & Bainbridge, 1994; Lacinski & Bergeron, 2000). While structural loadbearing assemblies are generally the simplest to build, reduce wood use, and thus have a lower embodied energy and carbon footprint (Offin, 2010), they preclude having a roof during construction making the technique only practical in the driest of climates. Snow and seismic loads require additional structural considerations. For these reasons, infill techniques represent the majority of North American straw bale buildings (Bronsema, 2010). There are numerous structural details pertaining to straw bale buildings, particularly where straw bales are used as a structural component. Bruce King's "Design of Straw Bale Buildings" (2006) provides a good summary of the current state of the art, covering the load bearing capacity of walls, plaster strengths and reinforcing, earthquake resistance, fire safety measures, and other related topics. 2.2.2 Hygrothermal Properties of Straw Bale Walls Thermal Performance The thermal conductivity of straw bales has been well researched over the past 25 years. The type of straw, its moisture content, density and the orientation of the fibres, and other elements such as the type of finish, all impact the overall thermal performance of the assembly. A thorough overview of the history of this research is provided by Bronsema (2010), where it is noted that the quality of the results for the overall thermal performance of an assembly is strongly influenced by the construction technique utilized. Density has a significant influence on conductivity, with higher bale densities generally providing better thermal performance (International Code Council (ICC), 2015). Appendix S of the 2015 IRC, states that "bales shall have a minimum dry

8

density of 6.5 pounds per cubic foot (104 kg/cubic meter). The dry density shall be calculated by subtracting the weight of the moisture in pounds (kilograms) from the actual bale weight and dividing by the volume of the bale in cubic feet (cubic meters)" (International Code Council (ICC), 2015). While there is a poor correlation between the measured conductivity of straw and the measured R-value of plastered walls (Bronsema, 2010), testing of plastered straw bale walls using a guarded hot-box facility, has led to some recommendations. Andersen (2001) (as cited in Bronsema, 2010) advises using a conductivity for straw of 0.08 W/mK, a value slightly more conservative than the reported range of 0.06-0.075 W/m-K suggested by Struabe & Burnett (2005). Where best practices are followed, Bronsema (2010) advises using conductivities between 0.060 and 0.070 W/m-K for bales laid on edge (heat flow perpendicular to the grain) and between 0.065 and 0.075 W/m-K for bales laid on flat (heat flow parallel to the grain). These values, though they are in line with the oft-citied 4.76 m2K/W to 5.28 m2K/W given to a plastered straw bale wall (ASRi, 2013; King, 2006; Magwood, Essential Prefab Straw Bale Construction, 2016; Stone, 2003), they are generous compared to thermal resistance values for straw bales included in Appendix S of the 2015 International Residential Code (IRC). In it, the permitted R-values are 1.3 per inch (0.11 W/m-K) for bales laid flat and 2 per inch (0.072 W/m-K) for bales on-edge. This is likely a broad net intended to capture instances where best practices are not followed, but seeing that straw bale construction is now effectively codified, at least in many parts of the US, these values are significant. Given the tremendous experience of those involved in shaping Appendix S, and noting the inherent variability of straw bales as a building material, using these especially conservative values seems prudent, especially in high performance construction where precision matters. The type of plaster used with the assembly has little bearing on the thermal resistance of the assembly since the R-value of the plaster is generally less than 5 percent of the R-value of the straw bale (Bronsema, 2010).

Air Permeability and Convection Air spaces that bypass insulation in cavities results in natural convection, which negatively impacts the thermal resistance of an assembly. Filling voids between bales and framing members with loose straw to a density comparable to the bale is essential for maintaining thermal continuity. The importance of this was demonstrated by Andersen (2001), who found that the U-factor increased by more than 10% by not properly dealing with voids within the straw bale assembly being tested, an effect that increases with temperature differences through the straw (as citied in Bronsema, 2010). Similar findings were reported by Rissanen & Viljanen (1998) in their work on the thermal conductivity in flax straw. Reducing air gaps between the plaster and straw is also important, as this too can contribute to natural convection, thus increasing heat flow. A 1996 test on a straw bale wall system at the Oak Ridge National Labs (ORNL), resulted in R-values one third of what had previously been reported (Stone, 2003). This result was due to the presence of numerous and significant air gaps between the bales and the interior mounted sheetrock and between the bales and the exterior stucco (Stone, 2003). To the testers credit, this was a demonstration for elementary school teachers and not as a rigorous attempt at measuring thermal performance. It does however serve a purpose in demonstrating the need to avoid gaps between bales and the finish used to encase them. Moisture Rotting of straw is the largest durability concern for straw bale buildings (Holzhueter, 2010). Reducing high moisture levels in straw from built-in moisture, interior and exterior humidity, driving rain, splash back, ground moisture and plumbing leaks is necessary to prevent decay. The process of decay in cellulosic materials, including straw, is covered in detail by Holzhueter (2010) and Bronsema (2010), and in lesser detail by King (2006). To deal with built-in moisture, the moisture content of straw bales at the time of installation should not exceed 20% the total weight of the bale (ASRi, 2013;
10

International Code Council (ICC), 2015). Once moisture content exceeds 20% mold spores may start to grow (ASRi, 2013). Rain control is crucial to avoid freeze-thaw damage, corrosion and decay, and the `Canadian holistic approach' as described by the three D's, 1) Deflection, 2) Drainage/Storage/Exclusion, 3) Drying, should guide decisions to mitigate durability and health problems (King, 2006). Building shape and site design are important considerations, especially as straw bale walls tend to use the storage approach for dealing with moisture (King, 2006). Thus, minimizing wetting is essential. According Gonzales (n.d.), the 3-foot (~1 metre) overhang rule-of-thumb has been used for one-storey buildings, while larger roof overhangs are recommended for taller buildings (as citied in ASRi, 2013). Where there is high exposure, rainscreen designs are possible and desirable. In all cases, adequate drip overhangs and flashing details must be in place to move water away from the walls. Grade separation and the use of porous surfaces are used to control splashback, and keeping bales a minimum of 203 mm (8 inches) above grade is generally considered the minimum for straw bale walls (King, 2006). A moisture break between the ground (typically the foundation interface) and the wall prevents moisture migration through capillary action.

Air Barriers Airtightness is important to reduce energy loss and to guard against condensation problems assosciated with uncontrolled movement of moisture-laden air into wall assemblies. Interior plasters generally provide the air barrier to a straw bale wall assembly but they must be continuous to be effective. Where plasters meet dissimilar materials, particularly at intersections with the floor, window and door jambs, ceiling, and framing members, careful detailing is required to ensure there is no air leakage into the wall assembly. Historically, achieving airtightness with straw bale assemblies has

11

been a challenge - a point well described by Racusin, Graham, & McArleton (2011), whereby post-occupancy energy performance evaluations of seven recently built straw bale homes in the northeastern US found substantial air leakage (all projects tested Â³2.5 ACH50), even where secondary air barrier strategies were deployed. This research represents the largest single effort to collect energy performance metrics on straw bale homes in North America to date. Assembly specific strategies for controlling air leakage at critical intersections, including recommendations from the report, are covered in Section 5.3.5.

Vapour Control Numerous studies have shown that straw bale wall assemblies must have the ability to transfer and release water vapour in order to prevent long-term accumulation of moisture (Gagne, 1997; Jolly, 2000; Holzhueter, 2010; Bronsema, 2010). Managing the moisture balance depends on having air barriers and using vapour control measures that minimize diffusion wetting and that promote drying of incidental moisture. The combination of straw and plaster has significant vapour diffusion resistance and large moisture storage capacity, making conventional `vapour barrier' strategies unnecessary and even detrimental (King, 2006). A typical 460mm (18 inch) straw bale has a vapour permeance ranging from 110-230 ng/Pa-s-m (~2 to 4 US perms) and evidence suggests the total cumulative permeance of the plaster skins on either face should not be less than 290 ng/Pa-s-m (~5 US perms), including any any surface treatment or sealer, to encourage fast drying (ASRi, 2013). Appendix S of the 2015 International Residential Code (IRC) states that "Class I and II vapour retarders shall not be used on a strawbale wall, nor shall any other material be used that has a vapor permeance rating of less than 3 [US] perms [172 ng/Pa-s-m]..." (International Code Council (ICC), 2015, pp. S-7). In general, limiting humidity to 80% RH within the assembly will prevent mould growth, though Bronsema (2010) suggests that this static limit imposed for all temperatures is

12

overly conservative, and "does not include time to germination...[and that] small fluctuations above these limits are likely not going to lead to mould growth..." (pg. 56). Keeping below this upper limit is, however, a useful reference point for evaluating the suitability of an assembly in regards to health and long term durability (PHIUS, 2015).

2.3 Case Studies on High Performance Straw Bale Walls The following case studies provide an overview of how typical 2-string straw bales have been used to build high performance wall assemblies. Common to the projects is an increased emphasis on airtightness, super insulation, and reduced thermal bridging to achieve the increasingly rigorous performance standards such as Passive House. 2.3.1 S-House As part of the "Building for Tomorrow" subprogram, the Center of Appropriate Technology (GrAT/Gruppe Angepasste Technologie) at the Vienna University of Technology developed a concept house ("S-House"), which sought to meet the strict energy targets of the passive house method using renewable materials. The target was to create a building that used only 10 percent of the resources and energy compared to conventional Austria construction (GrAT, 2004).

Figure 3: S-House (GrAT, 2004)

13

The wall assembly was made up of an inner wooden plate structure (CLT), wrapped in straw bales on the exterior. The exterior straw bales were then coated with a single coat of clay plaster to seal the bales, thus making the ventilated faÃ§ade less vulnerable. Custom designed Treeplast screws - made from a lignin based biopolymer and measuring 365mm (14.6 inches) in length - were used to fasten counterlathing to the straw bale wall in order to mount the wooden siding, completing the rainscreen (Figure 4; Wimmer, Hohensinner, & Drack, 2004).

Figure 4: The wall of the S-House showing the layers of the straw bale insulated novel construction in a model and on the building site (adapted from Wimmer, Hohensinner, & Drack (2004)).

The building was fitted with sensors to allow for long-term monitoring of the building components and materials, assessing humidity, temperature, heat flow, and proofing of airtightness. Unfortunately, only several months of data has been made publically available (http://www.s-house.at/BSaktuelleWerte.htm)1, making it difficult to draw conclusions on the success of this system. It does, however, mimic a "perfect wall" assembly, with the structure inbound of the insulation, which has the added protection of a ventilated rain screen. According to Brian Fuentes, a Colorado-based architect who has used the S-House as inspiration for the straw bale projects he has worked on, including his own home, says the "S-House" represents a high achievement for integrating straw bales into high performance buildings (personal conversation Sept 19, 2017).

1

Requests for additional monitoring data for the S-House were unsuccessful.

2.3.2 Modcell Developed through a collaboration with the Department of Architecture & Civil Engineering at the University of Bath, Modcell strawbale SIPs (structural insulated panels) have gone through rigorous scientific monitoring and testing, culminating in industry standards that show their energy efficiency, fire safety, long term durability, and ability to withstand extreme weather events (University of Bath, 2017). BM TRADA's QMark certification provides assurances of all these qualities and enables developers and homebuyers to obtain insurance and mortgages for straw bale homes and buildings (University of Bath, 2017). The ModCell Core + panel has received recognition as a `Certified Passive House Component', meeting the necessary heat transfer coefficient for the building envelope, thermal bridge free design connection details, and airtightness requirements for all components and connection details (ModCell, 2017). A 400mm (16 inch) deep wood frame contains the straw bales and the system is dry lined using breathable sheathing boards - a 15mm (5/8 inch) OSB3 VCL sheathing board on the interior, and a combination 12mm (1/2 inch) external breather board with a 40mm (~1 5/8 inch) wood fibre breather/plaster carrier - and finished with 7-8mm (~1/3 inch) of breathable exterior lime render (Figure 5/Figure 6; ModCell, 2017). The 0.49m thick wall panel has a thermal heat transfer coefficient of 0.122 (W/m2K), which results in a RSI of 8.20 (m2K/W; R-46.54)2.

2

The Modcell thermal resistance claim relies on straw bales with a thermal conductivity in the ballpark of

0.06 W/m-K (noting that their bales are 400mm deep versus 356mm deep for common North American straw bales on edge). This is in line with the recommend thermal conductivity range of 0.060 and 0.070 W/m-K for bales on edge noted in the literature review, and the slightly more generous than the 0.0721 W/m-K given to straw bales used in this research.

15

Figure 5: ModCell Core + Internal View (adapted from (ModCell, 2017)

Figure 6: ModCell Core + External View (adapted from (ModCell, 2017)

ModCell Core + has been developed with 26 compliant construction details including basement, wall and rood intersections, ceiling, partition and window details that can be used across Europe (ModCell, 2017). Modcell panels have been used in dozens of projects across Europe, including in schools/secondary institutions, business complexes, retail/commercial spaces, community projects and residential dwellings. 2.3.3 StrawCell StrawCell - a portmanteau that merges straw bales with dense packed cellulose - is a concept developed by New Frameworks of Vermont. The assembly affixes a typical 2string bale to an externally framed wall that is dense packed with cellulose (Graham, 2014). Its development came about after an energy audit of seven straw bale homes

16

initiated by the group, which showed some consistent problem areas. StrawCell sought to create better straw wall details to promote greater airtightness, accommodate modifications for increased energy performance (e.g. increased R-value), and to make construction easier and more affordable (Graham, 2014). The layers of the assembly from exterior to interior include (Figure 7): Exterior siding over a ventilated rain screen; WRB over 13mm (Â½ inch) insulated sheathing; 2x6 exterior load bearing wall insulated with dense packed cellulose; Straw bale on edge secured to 2x framing and plastered on the interior face (New Frameworks, 2013).

Figure 7: The StrawCell Wall Assembly (New Frameworks, 2013).

Some of the distinguishing features of this system include: No exterior plaster, which eliminates a time-consuming and weather sensitive step (this has the added benefit of extending the building season for working with straw bales, which is often limited to warm months); Straw bales are placed to the interior of the frame, making them less susceptible to weather during construction; 13mm (Â½ inch) vertical lath is used on the inside face of the bales to sandwich the bales to the framed wall. This creates stability in the unplastered wall so that

17

the bale strings can be cut to reduce time associated with stuffing the voids between bales; Interior structural elements are eliminated, thus creating fewer interruptions that can interfere with the interior plaster air barrier; Windows and doors are finished in the same way as typical construction; The additional depth of insulation makes achieving increasing standards for superinsulated structures (e.g. Passivhaus) possible; Increased flexibility for siding options to fit with the local building vernacular (New Frameworks, 2013). Overall, adding 140mm of dense packed cellulose to the straw bale wall adds an additional RSI-3.79 m2K/W, resulting in a total RSI-9.07 m2K/W for the entire assembly. This represents a 70% increase in thermal resistance over a typical single-width plastered straw bale wall. Additionally, the cellulose blown against the face of the bales deals with any voids resulting from the irregularity of the bale surface, and thus creates a flat, thermally connected surface for which subsequent layers can be affixed.

2.3.4 Zero House The Zero House was a joint project between The Endeavour Centre and Ryerson University's Department of Architectural Science and centered around five main concepts: 1) zero net energy use, 2) zero carbon footprint, 3) zero toxins, 4) zero construction waste, 5) zero cost premium over conventional construction (Alter, 2017). The demonstration unit was designed not as a sand alone house, but as a unit that could be assembled into a larger housing development (Alter, 2017). The entire building was prefabricated and modular, and included a variety of assembly configurations used to showcase the range of options for achieving these goals. Two of the walls included straw bales in a prefabricated panel (Figure 8) using two different insulation boards - one wood fibre-based, the other mycelium-based - on the exterior face of the panel to boost the R-value of the assembly. The interior was finished with ReWall EssentialBoard - a structural sheathing product made from 100% recycled

18

beverage containers. The RSI values of these assemblies were 6.87 m2K/W and 7.22 m2K/W respectively (Endeavour Centre, 2017).

Figure 8: Straw SIP used in Zero House (Endeavour Centre, 2017).

The water vapor transmission of the interior structural sheathing product (<57.2135 ng/Pa-s-m (1 US perm), which constitutes a Class I vapor retarder) does not satisfy best practice, and fails to comply with the recommendations in Appendix S of the 2015 International Residential Code (IRC). Despite this, the design team was comfortable with assembly after a hygrothermal analysis done by the Ryerson Architectural Science students involved with the project showed no signs of elevated moisture (C. Magwood, personal communication Dec 17, 2017). This suggests that assemblies that deviate from best practice may indeed yield acceptable results but must be assessed on a case by case basis to avoid issues related to durability, health and performance. 2.4 Literature Review Conclusion Passive Houses have set a high bar for energy performance, long-term durability, and human health and comfort. The Standard represents where most building/energy codes are headed (Yip & Richman, 2015), and the performance targets align with the conservation goals promoted by organizations such as Architecture 2030, at least with regards to operational energy savings. Limiting embodied carbon emissions in buildings

19

is also needed and straw bales have many qualities that make them well suited to high performance construction, while also sequestering carbon and locking it up over the life of the project. However, the successful use of straw bales in high performance building requires that best practices be followed. Choosing bales with the desired density and ensuring that voids are filled to reduce natural convection is necessary to achieve thermal performance in line with published values, while managing moisture is largely a matter of good design and proper implementation, especially with regards to ensuring adequate airtightness and controlling rain exposure. Using dry bales and keeping them dry during the construction process is necessary to avoid microbial decay. The case studies above demonstrate novel ways of combining straw bales with compatible offthe-shelf building materials to satisfy increasingly stringent energy performance standards, though the development of these hybrid assemblies is still very much in its infancy. Just as the StrawCell assembly was developed to address the specific needs of those building in the cold and wet climate of the Northeastern USA, it is only natural that other configurations will come about to meet the unique needs of other regions, whether to satisfy local code requirements, to achieve certain performance targets, to make use of locally available materials and/or trade skills, or to deal with weather and climate variables. High performance straw bale assemblies specific to Western Canada have received little focus and this research seeks to address this gap by defining and evaluating a high performance straw bale wall assembly that is regionally relevant and climate appropriate, and specific to achieving PHIUS+ 2015 in the three select cities.

3.0 Research Approach
A reference house previously certified by the Canadian Passive House Institute (CanPHI) in 2015 was used to test the impact of a straw bale wall assembly developed to satisfy the various compliance thresholds needed to achieve PHIUS+ 2015 certification for the select cities. A complete description of the reference house is presented in Section 4.0.

20

A whole building energy model was created using WUFI Passive - a software program used to determine the operating energy consumption in accordance with the Standard. Early assessments comparing predicted modeled performance with actual usage from measured data shows that the PHIUS+ 2015 algorithms and assumptions appear accurate, though this work has largely been restricted to multifamily dwellings (Klingenberg, 2017). It is anticipated that as projects become more numerous, and as more measured data is collected, similar assessments will be conducted on differing building archetypes, creating more measured data feedback loops in an effort to hone the accuracy of the modeling tools (Klingenberg, 2017). The model was populated using the parameters from the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) submitted with the original PHI certified project (the full PHPP is included in Appendix I). Three models - one for each of the select cities - were created and simulations were run using PHIUS approved climate data for each location. As the performance requirements are unique to each location, and because protocols for achieving compliance differ between the two Standards, minor adjustments were made to each model to achieve compliance with the PHIUS+ 2015 standard. An overview of the whole building energy modeling process is provided in Section 5.2. Once compliance was achieved for each of the select locations, the `as-designed' above-grade walls were then substituted with a straw bale wall assembly that maintained compliance. Defining an appropriate straw bale assembly was accomplished through an iterative process, adjusting the assembly as necessary to satisfy the targets set by the Standard for each location, and informed by the best practices revealed during the literature review. An overview of this assembly is provided in Section 5.3. Where modifications were made to the original design to accommodate the straw bale wall assemblies, thermal bridge analysis was carried out. An overview of thermal bridge free construction is provided in Section 5.3.5 and the results of the thermal bridge analysis are given in Section 6.2.

21

Finally, the hygrothermal performance of each straw bale wall assembly used to achieve PHIUS+ 2015 compliance for each of the select cities was conducted using WUFI Plus. A full overview of this process is covered in Section 6.3. The research approach is summarized in a flow chart in Figure 9 below.

4.0 Reference Building Design
4.1 Building Typology The reference building is a single-family detached (SFD) house with a basement suite built in Calgary, Alberta and certified by the Canadian Passive House Institute (CanPHI) in 2015 (Figure 10). This home was chosen for three primary reasons. Firstly, since this is a certified Passive House, the integrity of the design - orientation, floor plan layout, windows and components, and mechanical systems - could be maintained while simply allowing for the wall assembly to be modified to measure the impact on performance. Secondly, SFDs represent over half of the residential dwelling units in Canada and over 67% of total built floor area (Natural Resources Canada, 2014). It also represents the primary typology for which straw bales are used in construction (ASRi, 2013). Thirdly,
22

the inclusion of a secondary suite in the home represents an additional technical challenge for achieving the Standard but the prevalence of secondary suites in Canada is on the rise and this trend is projected to continue (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, 2017).

Figure 10: Reference House (Passive House Canada, 2017 )

4.2 Reference House Description 4.2.1 Building Geometry and Orientation The reference house has a treated floor area of 256.4 m2 (2759.9 ft2), with a 104.6 m2 (1,125.8 ft2) basement suite and the remaining 1,634.1 ft2 (151.8 m2) divided between the main floor and loft area. The building geometry is compact, with a minimal footprint. The front of the house orients south-southwest at 196 degrees. The architectural drawings of the basement and main floor plans are shown in Figure 11. Site plan, sections and elevations of the reference home have been included in Appendix II.

4.2.2 Suitability for Straw Bale Integration Overall, the reference house design is not ideally suited for straw bales. It's sloping roofline, for example, would require that the straw bales be modified and fitted to the shape rather than the shape conforming to the bale. Furthermore, fitting bales above the structural beam supporting the clerestory would prove challenging. As was discussed in the literature review, designing around a bale module is the most effective path to creating a high performance enclosure. Eliminating complex shapes during the design phase is essential for maintaining thermal continuity and air tightness, while also improving buildability. These points will be further discussed in Section 5.3. 4.2.3 Building Envelope The basement slab and walls are traditional concrete wrapped in 203mm (8 inches) of EPS foam, with the concrete slab exposed to provide accessible thermal mass. The main level and loft walls are 38x140mm (2x6 inch) framing with additional exterior rock wool insulation. The roof assembly consists of a 406mm (16 inch) TJI with blown-in fibreglass, with an additional 38x38mm (2x2) insulated service cavity behind the interior gypsum wall board. The reference building envelope sections are presented in Figure 12 and assembly thermal properties are summarized in Table 2.

4.2.4 Glazing Size and Orientation PHI-certified triple-glazed windows were used throughout. The window frames are PVC with PU-foam insulation in the air chambers. A warm edge spacer is used and the sealed units are filled with Krypton gas. South and west-facing windows have a high solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC), while north-facing windows have a low SHGC. There are no east-facing windows. A summary of the window properties specified for the reference building is provide in Table 3. The total window area is 39.4 m2 (28.3 m2 glazed area).

4.2.5 Doors There is a total of three exterior doors. Two (one north-facing, another east-facing) are solid 3 hinge fiberglass PU-insulated doors with a single deadbolt. The U-Value for each of these doors is 0.80 W/m2K. The remaining door (south-facing) contains a 1.5 m2 PHIcertified triple-glazed unit with U-Value of 0.82 W/m2K and a SHGC of 0.5185. A warm edge spacer is used and the sealed units are filled with Krypton gas.

27

4.2.6 Ventilation System Two separate ERVs were installed to provide ventilation in each dwelling unit - one in the basement suite, another for the upper levels. It is a certified component by PHI, and is rated for air flow rates of 60 to 150m3/h (Zehnder, n.d.). Each unit has an effective heat recovery efficiency of 89.4% and an electric efficiency of 0.42 Wh/m3. The units allow for air flow balancing and has frost protection for the heat exchanger with continuous fresh air supply down to -15Â°C (outdoor air). 4.2.7 Heating, Cooling and Domestic Hot Water (DHW) Solar thermal flat plate collectors, covering 11m2, provide an estimated 74% of DHW needs. A condensing gas boiler with an 80% efficiency (at constant operation) feeds hydronic coils in the supply air streams for additional space heating and makes up the balance of DHW needs. 4.2.8 Thermal Bridges No thermal bridging data was inputted into the PHPP, suggesting that a thermal bridge analysis was not completed or the values were not significant enough to require inclusion. 4.2.9 Air Tightness An air change rate of 0.3 1/h was used for calculation purposes. This value also aligns with the verified pressurization test result as reported in the PHPP.

5.0 Reference Building Simulations
5.1 Chosen Geographic Locations Geographic locations were selected to reflect three relatively different climates in Western Canada (Table 4), each with good access to a straw resource and in locations with a population of over 100,000 people, whereby sustained population growth is anticipated to carry into the future (Statistics Canada, 2017). The three locations selected were Saskatoon, Calgary, and Kelowna.

5.2 Whole Building Energy Model 5.2.1 Whole Building Energy Modeling Software WUFI Passive 3.1 was used to create a whole building energy model using the design and parameters of the reference house described in Section 4.2. Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics collaborated with PHIUS and Owens Corning to develop a software tool that is suited to the varying climate zones found in North America (PHIUS, 2017). Climate-specific performance targets are entered into the software, along with PHIUSapproved climate data, allowing for buildings to be easily evaluated for compliance with the PHIUS+ 2015 Passive Building Standard. 5.2.2 Weather Data Climate data may be entered manually or loaded into the WUFI Passive software in a pre-formatted file type, though all climate data must be approved by PHIUS for each project (PHIUS, 2017). The climate files for the select cities were acquired from PHIUS in an XLS format and loaded directly into WUFI Passive without modification.

5.2.3 WUFI Passive Modeling Procedure & Assumptions A 3-D model was created in SketchUp based on the architectural plans and imported into WUFI Passive. The model was then populated with the parameters from the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) submitted with the original project. The

29

inputted floor area value was adjusted to reflect the fact that PHIUS+ and PHI calculate living space differently. While PHI calculates Treated Floor Area (TFA) - the living or useful floor area within the thermal envelope, PHIUS calculates the Conditioned Floor Area (iCFA) - the interior (drywall-to-drywall) floor area within the conditioned space with at least seven feet ceiling height (Passive House Institute US , 2017). The calculation method has implications for the performance targets, which are largely measured on a per unit of floor area basis. The calculated areas for the reference house based on the two calculation methods are shown in Table 5.

PHIUS and PHI also calculate the number of occupants differently. The calculation method and the calculated number of residents for the reference house based on each standard is shown in Table 6.

5.2.4 WUFI Passive Simulations Using the parameters outlined in Section 4, and accounting for any changes owing to PHIUS requirements (see Section 5.2.3), a model was created for each location to determine compliance with the PHIUS+ 2015 Passive Building Standard using PHIUSapproved climate data and the climate-specific performance targets.

The inflated annual cooling demand is the result of greater internal heat gains in the WUFI Passive model compared to the PHPP outputs. While the PHPP contained specific interior lighting and consumer electronic loads, PHIUS+ requires the use of default reference quantities for these variables, one for PHIUS+ Interior Lighting, another for PHIUS+MELs (miscellaneous electric loads, including televisions and plug loads. These loads are much greater, resulting in significantly larger internal heat gains, which translate into higher annual cooling demands. To remedy this, each model was adjusted for compliance.

31

Three primary adjustments were made to achieve compliance, though not all three were needed in all locations. This was an iterative process, beginning with the `low-hangingfruit'. These included: 1) Increasing natural night ventilation, a cooling strategy called `night flushing' that allows cool night air to carry away heat absorbed by the building during the day (Griffin, 2010), from 0.02 [1/h] used in the PHPP calculations to the default value of 0.3 [1/h] in the WUFI Passive software. This was applied to all three locations, and put Calgary in compliance with the Standard. 2) Increasing the percentage of high efficiency lighting from the 0% used in the PHPP calculations to 100% in the WUFI Passive software. This was applied to Saskatoon and Kelowna and had a measured impact in the correct direction but it was not sufficient to achieve compliance in either location. 3) Changing the south and west-facing windows from high SHGC models to low SHGC models. This change was applied to Saskatoon and Kelowna and resulted in both locations achieving compliance. The results of these changes are listed in Table 9.

With each of the models now compliant with the PHIUS+ 2015 Passive Building Standard, a straw bale wall assembly was fitted to the model for all above grade walls. The assembly is defined in the proceeding section. 5.3 Developing the Straw Bale Wall Assembly 5.3.1 Assessment Criteria As the case studies revealed, there are multiple opportunities for achieving a highperforming building envelope with straw bales. To achieve Passive House certification, the wall assembly must satisfy four primary criteria, including: 1) Adequate thermal resistance; 2) Climate appropriate construction such that mold and moisture risks are minimized; 3) Thermal bridge free construction; 4) Air tightness. The recommended assembly will need to satisfy these primary criteria - verified in WUFI Passive (see Section 6.1) - while also addressing some practical considerations buildability, cost, reduced maintenance, and the overarching goal of reduced embodied carbon. These secondary criteria provide a lens by which to evaluate the materials/methods needed to satisfy the primary criteria. Of particular importance is the buildability of the assembly, especially as conventional trades are unlikely to be familiar with straw bale construction. High performance construction, especially where air tight enclosures are required, already face challenges from the trades (Magwood, 2012b); introducing an unfamiliar material only adds to this challenge. Simplifying the assembly as much as possible to match standard practice is necessary to increase the likelihood of achieving the primary criteria required to meet the Standard. And though straw bale SIPs, such as those used by ModCell, have been used successfully in projects achieving Passive House certification (in Europe), the intention of this evaluation is to recommend a site-built (and not prefabricated) assembly

33

that follows the convention of how the majority of houses are constructed in North America. This assessment will begin by looking at buildability.

5.3.2 Buildability According to Erb (2014), "a wall built according to standard practices is the most buildable wall because standard practice is "easy" in the sense that it is well-understood by all involved" (pg. 15). While most of the trades are unlikely to be familiar with straw bales, aligning the rest of the assembly with standard practices, where practical, is likely to improve the buildability. It's also worth noting that Passive House assemblies are considered less buildable in North America because they deviate from code-minimum construction methods and require more time, material, and care to build (Erb, 2014). Additional training and supervision is likely for any Passive House project in North America, not just those involving straw bale. An ideal assembly, then, is one that maximizes both buildability and the overall performance potential. With straw bale, the framing method impacts the performance potential to a large degree, influencing: 1) thermal bridging, 2) windows and door installation, including where they may be mounted within the wall plane, 3) ease of installing bales and the tightness of the overall wall (more voids and areas stuffed with loose straw results in greater heat transfer); and 4) opportunities for affixing additional components - air sealing products, sheathing and insulating boards, cabinets, or strapping for a rainscreen3. There are no fewer than a dozen framing methods for straw bale construction (Magwood, 2015a), but not all are well suited to the goals of an idealized assembly. Balicki (2014) provides an overview of many of the most common framing methods used in Passive House construction - exterior insulation, double stud, Larsen truss, vertical TJI, all of which suit themselves to straw bale construction, and have indeed been used in straw bale projects, though not with an equivalent efficiency.

3

Rainscreen assemblies are increasingly common on straw bale wall assemblies and deal with one of the greatest susceptibilities of straw - the potential for microbial decay from wind-driven rain. Rainscreens also reduce maintenance and allow for a variety of siding options.

34

Getting most of a straw bale to the exterior of the structure involves one of two options, 1) embedding the frame within the bales - which requires notching and stuffing around the framing (impacting the integrity of the wall); mid-wall framing makes for difficult attachment of additional building components; 2) placing the bales to the exterior of the frame (similar to the S-House in Section 2.3.1) - but this generally involves additional footings - one for the structure, another to carry the bale loads - adding cost and complexity. Roof loads are also difficult, as overhangs must be cantilevered far from the structure. While it does approximate an ideal assembly, mimicking the "perfect wall", whereby most of the insulation is exterior of the frame, the use of straw bales to do so adds complexity and neither of the aforementioned designs could be regarded as particularly `buildable'. Of the remaining three - double stud, Larsen truss, vertical TJI - one stands out as the most buildable. Erb (2014), who assessed the framing methods described by Balicki (2014) for buildability, reported that double stud framing "is very similar to standard practice", scoring it in the "strong buildability" category alongside exterior insulation (Figure 13). It's also the framing method most commonly used with dense packed cellulose, a wall assembly becoming increasingly common (Magwood, 2015a). This framing method provides a thermal break between the framing members and simplifies the install of additional components mentioned previously, which, as the following sections will demonstrate, increase the performance potential needed to achieve compliance.

5.3.3 Adequate Thermal Resistance The PHIUS+ 2015 Certification Guidebook (Passive House Institute US , 2017) provides R-Value Guidelines for the various building assemblies - wall, ceiling, slab - based on the designated climate zone. The recommended RSI ranges for walls in each of the select cities is listed in Table 10.
Table 10: Wall RSI Ranges for Select Cities, adapted from (PHIUS, 2017).

Location Zone Saskatoon, SK 7A Calgary, AB 7A Kelowna, BC 6 * Actual values will vary by project.

RSI Ranges (m K/W)* 8.63 - 11.45 8.63 - 11.45 6.87 - 8.98

2

These guidelines offer a soft target but the R-value is specific to each project and is influenced by such things as the surface to volume ratio of the house, its orientation and microclimate, the number occupants, and all the other components and mechanical systems that influence the design and operation of the project. WUFI-Passive is used to balance these variables, allowing the modeler to `turn the dials' on the design and system components to achieve compliance. As such, the RSI ranges may deviate from the recommendations depending on the overall building design and modeled occupant behaviour. But seeing that a typical, "first generation", straw bale wall assembly has an RSI of 5.28 (m2K/W), which falls 30% to 117% below the recommendations, additional insulation is likely needed to achieve adequate thermal resistance for compliance. The literature review (Section 2) identified some of the opportunities to increase thermal resistance of straw bale assemblies, notably the use of insulation placed to the exterior of the bales. Insulated sheathing products (e.g. Sonoclimat Eco4), non-structural insulation boards (e.g. Roxul Comfortboard), or dense pack cellulose abutting the bales (e.g. StrawCell) can be used to increase the thermal resistance of the assembly. Table 11 notes the thermal conductivity of several insulation products that may be used in conjunction with straw bales.

The right material to be used in a straw bale assembly is not necessarily the one with the greatest R-value. Choosing components that serve multiple functions within an assembly is a worthwhile goal, as it is the overall quality of the assembly that is important in high performance enclosures. For example, insulated sheathing may satisfy structural needs and serve as a secondary air barrier, while the framing needed for dense pack cellulose may serve as the structural component for the building. Understanding the ancillary benefits of a product will help guide the decision-making process. 5.3.4 Climate appropriate construction Appendix B of the PHIUS+ 2015 Certification Guidebook provides moisture control guidelines that, if followed, generally lead to a "green light" for the assembly. They list four above-grade wall assemblies that capture most of the possible enclosure configurations, which include: a) Framed assemblies with all or most of the insulation inside of the sheathing and between the framing members,  b) Framed assemblies with some insulation outboard of the framing and some insulation between the framing members,  c) Assemblies with all or most of the insulation outboard of the structure (framed or solid), and  d) Assemblies with insulation comprised only of air-impermeable and Class II vapor control insulation between, within, or outside of the structure. 

37

Each of these configurations comes with a list of zone-specific criteria that must be met for the assembly to be deemed "appropriate". Assembly configuration `c' is noted as being "the simplest and most robust wall to design with respect to vapour control" (Passive House Institute US , 2017, p. 76), and most closely approximates the perfect wall concept. As was already discussed in Section 5.3.2, this is difficult to achieve with straw bales. In many cases, configuration `b' is the most suitable to high-performance straw bale assemblies, with some insulation value external to the framing or structure. For zones 6 to 8, which captures most of Canada, the "[insulated] sheathing-to-cavity Rvalue ratio" ranges from >0.50 to >0.70 (Passive House Institute US , 2017, p. 78), which is not only difficult but unnecessary for straw bale assemblies. WUFI analysis has shown that when best practices are followed, super insulated vapour-open straw bale assemblies manage moisture to within acceptable tolerances for maintaining a healthy wall assembly (ModCell, 2017). 5.3.5 Thermal Bridge Free Construction One of the "hard requirements" for PHIUS+ 2015 certification is avoiding significant thermal bridges to reduce heat loss and to avoid mold growth on interior surfaces made susceptible by low temperatures associated with thermal bridging. The thermal bridge coefficient (Psi-value) "represents the difference between the thermally interrupted component and the uninterrupted component that is assumed for the balance" (PASSIPEDIA, 2016). Thermal bridges occur where insulation is non-continuous, often at transition areas between dissimilar materials. These areas are to be modeled in THERM and if the thermal bridge is significant enough (Psi Â³ 0.01 W/mK) it must be accounted for in the WUFI Passive software. Additionally, compliance requires that the maximum temperature difference between the interior air and the interior surface temperature not be more than 4.0Â°C (PHIUS, 2015). As was discussed in Section 5.3.2, the framing system chosen for the assembly has a large impact on thermal bridging. Some framing systems are inherently better suited to reduced thermal bridging than others. For example, a double stud wall is naturally thermally broken, whereas a wall framed with a TJI is not. The framing system also has
38

implications for window and door installation, and for the mounting of insulated sheathing products that may reduce thermal bridging at vulnerable intersections. It is typically at the transition areas from one assembly to another (e.g. foundation to wall connection) where insulation continuity is difficult to maintain (Figure 14), and where thermal bridges are most pronounced. Choosing a framing system that allows for the inclusion of an adequate amount of insulation at these transition areas is important for a thermal bridge free design.

Figure 14: A Typical Straw Bale to Foundation Detail Where Insulation is Not Continuous (Magwood & Walker, 2001).

Aligning the insulation planes is also important to reduce thermal bridging. In the case of the reference house, the `as designed' above grade walls have externally mounted insulation that extends in the same plane as the externally mounted EPS insulation on the basement walls. To carry the loads of the straw bale assembly through the foundation using a typical thermally broken base plate, it requires offsetting the above grade walls from the basement walls, forcing the isotherms to fall out of plane, and creating a thermal bridge (Figure 15). Even when a solid baseplate is used to canteliver the bales over the EPS insulation, and adding significantly more insulated sheathing

39

and overinsulation at the basepate, an undesirable thermal bridge is created (Figure 16).

Figure 15: Straw bale assembly (with typical thermally broken base-plate) mounted on 'as designed' reference house foundation, showing distortion of the isotherms. Psi=0.100 W/mK. The lowest interior surface temperature was 4.9Â°C.

Figure 16: A solid base-plate allows the straw bale wall to cantilever over the EPS insulation but even with additional insulation and overinsulation at the connection point, an undesirable thermal bridge is created. Psi=0.049 W/mK. The lowest interior surface temperature was 11.8Â°C.

Choosing a foundation system that better suites the insulation profile of a straw bale is desirable to reduce the need for overinsulation and to improve buildability. Switching the `as designed' foundation to an ICF (insulated concrete form) foundation results in a straightening of the isotherms and mitigates the thermal bridge, even with a simpler straw bale wall assembly (Figure 17). The thickness of the EPS insulation and concrete

40

was maintained between the `as-designed' wall and the substituted ICF foundation and, therefore, the thermal resistance was maintained at an RSI of 6.73 m K/W as noted in
2

Table 2.

Figure 17: Using an ICF foundation allows the use of a simpler straw bale wall assembly without thermal bridging at the interface. Psi=0.0097 W/mK. The lowest interior surface temperature was 16.5Â°C.

5.3.6 Air Tightness Achieving air tight assemblies with straw bales can pose a challenge. While plasters provide an air barrier, they must be continuous to be effective. Where plasters meet dissimilar materials, particularly at intersections with the floor, window and door jambs, ceiling, and framing members, careful detailing is required to ensure there is no air leakage into the wall assembly. Overlapping plasters with adjoining wood is one strategy to achieve air tightness. A variation of this is to use an `air fin', which is typically a piece of drywall, tar paper, house wrap or homasote with added mesh to provide an adherent surface for the plaster (Figure 18). The air fin is then placed behind the framing or fixed to the framing with tape or acoustic sealant over which plaster is applied, effectively continuing the plaster without interruption. It is worth noting that the effectiveness of these non-commercial, `homemade' air fins has been shown to be inconsistent, with some resulting in bonding issues that result in unwanted air leakage (Magwood, 2012a). A better solution for this detailing is to use the increasingly available
41

off the shelf fleece air barrier tapes designed to hold plaster, thus making airtight construction much easier and effective (Figure 19).

Figure 18: Tar paper/diamond lath air fin at window buck (Frey, 2014).

Figure 19: CONTEGA FC tape ready to accept stucco over straw bale (475 High Performance Building Supply, 2014).

Another strategy is to use sheet materials to provide the air barrier. Care must be taken to choose products that maintain the "vapour-open" profile required to keep a straw bale wall assembly healthy. Sheet products that may be used include gypsum wall board (interior use only), wood fibre sheathing - a compressed wood fibre board with a waxbased binder - and magnesium oxide board (permeability ratings can vary widely depending on the manufacturer, so confirming the permeability is essential). Manufactured wood sheathing (plywood and oriented strand board (OSB)) does not
42

have the necessary water vapour permeability to be used with straw bale wall assemblies (Magwood, 2016). The major benefit of using sheet products is that they provide a solid backing for supporting air sealing tapes, making the air sealing process more robust and increases installation efficiency. And as was discussed in Section 2.2.2, care must be taken to fill out any voids between the bale face and the sheet material, as these voids allow for natural convection that lower the insulating ability. 5.3.7 Proposed Assembly The proposed assembly (Figure 20) came about through an iterative process, beginning with simulations using a `first-generation' wall assembly to establish a reference point (the results are summarized in Section 6.1.1), and adjusted as necessary to satisfy the targets set by the Standard for each location, and further informed by the best practices and case studies described in the literature review. The assessment criteria are listed in Section 5.3.1.

The assembly (Figure 21) consists of a double stud wall - 38x140mm (2x6 inch) outer stud and 38x64mm (2x3 inch) inner stud - built on 495mm centers (19.5 inches). This allows full bales to be used, placed on end, with the 360mm (14 inch) dimension creating the thickness of the wall - a configuration has the straw fibres running perpendicular to heat flow, and thus a higher R-value per inch. The base plate is 387mm wide (15.25 inches), with doubled up top plates to connect the wall to the roof bearing assembly. The exterior 38x140mm stud is offset from the exterior-most bale face by 32mm (1.25 inches) to accommodate the mineral wool insulated sheathing (e.g. Roxul Comfortboard) that will add to the R-value of the assembly, while also compressing into any voids that may be present on the bale face (thus reducing convective heat transfer)4. Outboard of the framing and the mineral wool insulated sheathing is 38mm (1.5 inches) of insulated sheathing (e.g. SonoClimat Eco4) to provide additional structural support and a solid backing for the mounting of the air-tight water resistant barrier (WRB; Solitex Mento+) which will be taped with a compatible airtight product (e.g. Tescon Vana by Pro Clima). 19x89mm (1x4 inches) vertical strapping will be mounted outboard of the WRB and the assembly will be finished with siding (e.g. Hardiboard). The interior bales will be finished with 38mm (1.5 inches) of earthen plaster (2 - 3 coats as per convention), and detailed with a felt-based air sealing tape (e.g. Contega PV by Pro Clima) designed for plasters. This tape is affixed to the adjoining interface and floated into the plaster to create an air-tight seal.

4

The primary purpose of the mineral wool insulated sheathing is to reduce natural convection that has been found to occur between the bale face and sheet materials. The easy to handle mineral wool insulated sheathing (which typically comes in 600x1200mm sheets) is flexible enough to facilitate easy filling of voids behind the material as it is installed, thus eliminating voids that cause natural convection. It has the added benefit of adding additional thermal resistance and provides a solution that eliminates all wet construction from the exterior of the assembly, increasing the construction window for building with straw bales. An alternative to this, especially where installation is not temperature sensitive (e.g. during months where freezing is not a risk), is to replace the mineral wool insulated sheathing with a coat of earthen plaster. The offset framing allows the plaster to be screeded across the framing faces to create a flat surface for which to affix the outboard insulated wood fibre sheathing. In this instance, if additional thermal resistance was required, the mineral wool insulated sheathing could be moved outbound of the WRB.

The total R-value of the assembly is 6.72 m2K/W (from 8.05 m2K/W). The final thickness, including the vented rainscreen is 0.52 metres (from 0.41 metres for the `as designed' wall assembly) - a 26% increase in thickness. The impact this has on floor area (iCFA) is discussed below. The results generated from substituting the `asdesigned' walls for the reference house with the proposed straw bale assembly are detailed in the results section that follows.

6.0 Results and Discussion
6.1 WUFI Passive Results 6.1.1 `First-Generation' Assembly A typical `first-generation' wall assembly comprised of a single width of bales on end with the interior and exterior bale faces plastered with 38mm of an earthen (clay-based) plaster was inputted to the PHIUS+ 2015-compliant models for each of the select cities. The assembly has a total R-value of 5.01 m2K/W. It's worth noting that the plaster type has negligible effect on the thermal resistance of the assembly, so any plaster system clay-lime, lime, cement-lime - could have been used for this analysis. The physical properties of the components used in the simulations for the first-generation straw bale assembly are listed in Table 12.

To assess the sensitivity of air leakage on the model, two sets of simulations were generated. The first simulation applied the 0.3 1/h air change rate (which corresponds to 0.0225 cfm/ft2 within the WUFI Passive model) used in the reference house PHPP model, while in the second simulation the air leakage rate was increased to 0.05 cfm/ft2 - a value that represents the maximum air leakage rate allowed for certification. For these simulations, the iCFA was kept the same as the reference house, thus suggesting the slight increase in wall thickness (0.43m from 0.41m) would be `pushed' to the exterior. A summary of the results for the five primary compliance criteria are listed in Table 13.

The results show that, with the exception of Saskatoon, the straw bale wall assembly satisfied all of the PHIUS+ 2015 primary certification criteria, even with the air leakage rate increased to the maximum permitted by the Standard (which is still a fraction of what is common of standard building practice). The decreased thermal resistance of the assembly had a negative impact on the annual heating demand and peak heating load in all locations; it did however have a beneficial impact on the annual cooling demand and peak cooling load in all locations. The source energy demand was little changed and complied in all locations. Regarding the Saskatoon model, the straw bale assembly was inadequate for meeting the annual heating demand and peak heating load, exceeding the target by 11.6% and 1.4% respectively. Increasing the air leakage rate to the maximum allowable limit resulted in poorer performance, with the target being exceeded by 21% for the annual heating demand and 16.9% for peak heating load. It needs to be said that while these outputs comply with the primary certification criteria for Calgary and Kelowna, and provide a useful reference point for building from, a `firstgeneration' straw bale assembly is not well suited to achieving the other criteria outlined in Section 5.3 necessary to achieve compliance. Air tightness and thermal bridge free construction are two matters that are not well suited to such a simplified system, thus necessitating an evolution toward a hybrid system that combines the desirable qualities of straw bale (e.g. thermal resistance, low embodied carbon, aesthetics) with complimentary materials to create an assembly suited to high performance enclosures. The next section summarizes the results of the proposed assembly.

6.1.2 Proposed Assembly The proposed wall assembly was inputted to the PHIUS+ 2015-compliant models for each of the select cities. The physical properties of the straw bale and earthen plaster are taken from above, while the additional components used in the proposed assembly are listed in Table 14.

Seeing that the proposed wall assembly is considerably thicker than the `as designed' wall assembly (0.52m from 0.41 m), two sets of simulations were performed to assess the sensitivity of the increased wall thickness on the models. In the first scenario, the additional wall thickness is `pushed' to the exterior, maintaining the same iCFA as the reference house model. The second scenario maintains the plane of the basement walls with that of the above grade walls, thus reducing the iCFA from 245.7m2 to 236.7m2. Both were modeled with an air change rate of 0.0225 cfm/ft2 (which corresponds to the 0.3 1/h air change rate achieved by the reference house). Because the PHIUS+ 2015 targets are measured on a per-unit of area basis, a smaller iCFA results in an energy intensity penalty, thus negatively impacting the results. This is a consideration that must be balanced during the design phase. A summary of the results for the five primary compliance criteria are listed in Table 15.

As was mentioned above, reducing the iCFA had a negative impact on performance and pushed the Annual Heating Demand for Saskatoon slightly above the target (from 27.3 kWh/m2a to 28.59 kWh/m2a, and 0.7% above the target). All other targets were satisfied in Saskatoon with the reduced iCFA. Calgary and Kelowna satisfied the targets under both scenarios. Where the iCFA was maintained, adapting the proposed straw bale assembly to the above grade walls of the reference house satisfied the five primary performance targets for all 3 locations (the full WUFI Passive reports for each location are included in Appendix IV). This remainder of the discussion will centre on these models (where the iCFA = 245.7m2), as it provides an apples-to-apples comparison to the reference house.

50

The compliance achieved in the above simulations is also based on the thermal resistance across a clear section of wall. To determine if there is penalty to the thermal resistance owning to thermal bridging at the connections between the proposed assembly and the existing components, further analysis is required. This is examined in Section 6.2. The results also show that even with the same assembly, there is not a linear relationship between the climate-specific PHIUS targets and the modeled outputs. For example, Saskatoon complies within 4% of the annual heating demand target, while Calgary, with only a slightly smaller annual heating demand target (27.13 versus 28.39 kWh/m2a), achieves it by a margin of 63.1%5. Kelowna achieves its annual heating demand target by 63.1%. This non-linear relationship suggests that performing a whole house model is necessary to determine the suitability of various components, walls included, in determining the overall performance of a building. Inferring an assembly's R-value for a corresponding climate zone is not likely to give dependable results. As was noted above, it was also assumed that the airtightness achieved with the wall assembly in the reference house was maintained with the proposed straw bale wall assembly. The proposed assembly was designed to offer ample opportunities for air sealing, including some redundancy. For example, the use of exterior mounted insulated sheathing mounted behind an airtight membrane provides a good measure of initial air tightness, while the earthen plaster used in conjunction with air sealing tape at vulnerable intersections provides redundancy on the interior. To test the sensitivity of air tightness on the overall performance of the building, additional simulations for two variations (0.04 cfm/ft2 & 0.05 cfm/ft2) were conducted. The results are summarized in Table 16.

5

The similar annual heating demand permitted under PHIUS+ 2015 for Saskatoon and Calgary is curious, as Saskatoon is a much colder climate (see Table 4), though both locations are similar in other respects - wind speed (https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/Canada/Cities/wind-annual-average.php) and mean daily insolation values (http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/18366). This disparity is perhaps something PHIUS needs to address.

These results reveal the scale of impact that airtightness has on overall performance, most notably impacting the performance during the heating season. While Calgary and Kelowna could buffer the impact of a leakier building, the Saskatoon model could not, with the annual heating demand and peak heating load exceeding the target at both intervals. This again speaks to the need to develop an assembly that lends itself to airtight construction. With the Saskatoon model edging so close to its performance targets, if an extremely high degree of airtightness could not be assured (e.g. ~0.0225 cfm/ft2) it may be necessary to add additional outboard insulation to buffer the effects of increased air leakage. 6.2 Thermal Bridge Analysis 6.2.1 THERM Software THERM is a 2-dimensional heat-transfer modeling program developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). It also practitioners to model 2-dimensional heat transfer effects in building components where thermal bridges are of concern, allowing a precise evaluation of a component's energy efficiency. It also provides local temperature patterns that could lead to condensation, moisture damage, and/or structural concerns. THERM is also commonly used with the Berkeley Lab WINDOW program to determine window product U-factors and SHGCs. 6.2.2 Thermal Bridge Simulations Five intersections were identified for thermal bridge analysis: the basement wall to slab (Figure 22), basement wall to above grade straw bale wall (Figure 23), corners between two walls (Figure 24), and two connections of the straw bale wall to the roof - one for the obtuse connection (Figure 25) and another for the acute connection (Figure 26). Each of these `typical' building envelope connection details was created and simulated in THERM.

It was assumed that windows would be installed in a similar manner to the reference house, with 2 inches of ridged insulation installed on the head and sill prior to mounting the window frame (Figure 27). A YInstallation of 0.040 (W/mk) was assumed for all windows and reflected in the total window u-value reported in Table 3.

As was discussed in Section 5.3.4, the basement walls were changed to ICFs to better align the insulation plane created with the proposed assembly and to increase buildability. This configuration resulted in a small thermal bridge where the ICF basement wall meets the slab (psi = 0.0123 W/mK; Figure 28). The lowest minimum interior surface temperature is 16.2Â°C, which complies with PHIUS' criteria for thermallybridged construction details. This thermal bridge was omitted from the WUFI Passive simulations for the 3 select cities owing to its negligible size.

6.3 Hygrothermal Analysis When the zone-specific criteria set out in Appendix B of the PHIUS+ 2015 Certification Guidebook (Passive House Institute US , 2017) are not met, a hygrothermal analysis (WUFI) is required to demonstrate that the proposed assembly manages moisture within an accepted range. Since the proposed assembly deviates from the zone-specific criteria moisture control guidelines established by PHIUS, namely that the insulated sheathing-to-cavity ratio be 0.5 to 0.7 for climate zones 6 and 7/8 respectively, hygrothermal analysis was conducted on the proposed straw bale assembly.

6.3.1 WUFI Plus WUFI Plus is a simulation tool developed to compute dynamic heat and moisture transfer in a one-dimensional assembly. Its capabilities include modeling heat and moisture transfer through multilayered assemblies using user defined exterior and interior conditions, including temperature, relative humidity, driving rain, and solar radiation. According to Bronsema (2010): Heat transfer is calculated through thermal conduction, enthalpy of moisture movement and phase changes, solar radiation and nighttime radiation. Surface film coefficients are used to calculate heat loss to the surroundings in a manner that is similar to the conduction equations, these films can be constant or wind dependent. Moisture movement is broken into two compounds: vapor and liquid. The vapor movement is computed by vapor diffusion as well as solution diffusion. Liquid transport is characterized by capillary conduction and surface diffusion (p. 152). WUFI simulations are accurate in predicting hygrothermal behavior in building enclosures so long as robust climate data is used, and the correct physical and boundary conditions are supplied (Straube & Schumacher (2003) as cited in Bronsema, 2010).

6.3.2 WUFI Plus Simulations Hygrothermal simulations were run for the proposed straw bale assembly in each of the three select cities. Hourly weather files (.wac format) were obtained for each location and used for the analysis. Material properties were created using technical data sheets from the manufactures. Where specific properties were not provided, defaults found in the material database for similar materials were used. The properties most crucial for accurate hygrothermal analysis are listed in Table 20.

Following ASHRAE 160P (Section 4.6.1 - Rain Penetration), the default value for water penetration through the exterior surface was set at 1% of the water reaching the exterior face of the water resistive barrier (PHIUS, 2015). Again, following the PHIUS (2015) guideline, an air change rate of 50 [1/h] was applied to the vented cavity using the actual thickness of the ventilation cavity (19mm).

Figure 32: Mean RH (%) of NE Wall in Kelowna

These plots show a clear pattern of seasonal wetting and drying, with no noticeable increase in RH over that time. The wall assembly in Calgary and Kelowna show seasonal cycling within safe limits (<80% RH) for all layers over the 5 year period. In Saskatoon, the insulated sheathing (e.g. Sonoclimat Eco4) shows elevated RH during winter months but there is strong drying as temperatures begin to increase. ASHRAE Standard160P states that in order to minimize the conditions for mould growth the: "30day running average surface RH<80% when the 30-day running average surface temperature is between 5C and 40C (p.12)." The data were assessed using these criteria for the NE wall in a typical year (2018). It was found that the conditions for mould growth defined by ASHRAE Standard 160P were not present, suggesting the proposed straw bale wall assembly is not at risk in the Saskatoon climate. Temperature and RH for the insulated sheathing layer are plotted together for the Saskatoon in Figure 33. Again, the NE wall is shown as it represents the most extreme case.

6.4 Summary The results show that the proposed assembly is capable of meeting the PHIUS+ 2015 certification criteria in each of the 3 select cities. Achieving a high degree of airtightness (as was achieved with the reference house) is, however, necessary to satisfy the targets. Seeing that straw bale buildings have historically struggled to achieve extremely high degrees of air tightness, it would be prudent to model with an air change rate closer to the maximum permitted under the Standard. This is especially true of locations, Saskatoon for instance, where the performance targets are narrowly satisfied even with an assumed air change rate far below that permitted under the Standard. This allows the designer to turn the dials in other areas (e.g. adding more outboard insulation to the straw bale wall assembly) to ensure the performance targets are satisfied. The inclusion of a secondary suite skews the results by increasing the total occupancy by one6, and this has implications for the target criteria, increasing the heating demand and load, as well as the source energy demand (cooling demand and load decrease owing to fewer occupants and associated internal gains; see Appendix V for full results). Occupancy needs to be considered early in the design process, as the number of occupants has a significant impact on the overall performance of the home.
6

Recall, PHIUS+ 2015 calculates the occupancy at # of bedrooms +1. In the case of the reference house, there are 2 units, each with 2 bedrooms, resulting in 6 occupants. Removing the basement suite results in 5 occupants.

65

The proposed assembly takes inspiration from the case studies, particularly the prefabricated straw bale panels that have successfully been used in passive house projects, using complimentary materials to maintain thermal continuity and air tightness, and to add additional thermal resistance necessary for compliance. While these high performance straw bale assemblies may be seen as a vast departure from the rather elegant and uncomplicated plastered bale wall that early practitioners used to good effect, for straw bale building to remain relevant the systems must evolve to meet new code and performance requirements, and to satisfy occupant expectations relating to durability and aesthetics.

7.0 Conclusions
Though straw bales have not been used in a PHIUS+ 2015-certified project to date, the results of the analysis indicate that straw bales can be a beneficial component in satisfying the requirements of the Standard in Western Canada. The literature review identified the qualities of straw bales required to assure reliable performance from the material, while also highlighting the key characteristics of complementary materials need to create a superinsulated straw bale assembly. These material qualities are necessary to achieve thermal performance, as well as to mitigate any issues relating to excessive moisture within the assembly. Deficiencies related to thermal bridging and air tightness are minimized by following one of the main guiding principles of Passive House design, namely simple form. Designing around a bale module is the most effective path to maintaining the integrity of the thermal envelope, and minimizing transitions reduces thermal bridging and reduces the air control detailing necessary for air tight construction. Merging thoughtful design with material compatibility allows straw bales to be used in creating building enclosures capable of achieving the Passive House standard, while also minimizing the embodied carbon of the enclosure.

66

8.0 Future Work
With the theoretical groundwork in place, there remains a need to test straw bale buildings that are specifically designed with the goal of achieving Passive House standards, particularly in regards to achieving the air tightness goals set out by the standards. There remains ample opportunity to evaluate alternate assembly configurations using straw bales, and associated components, within high performance enclosures, including both modular (and pre-fabricated) and site-built assemblies. There will no doubt be adherents to the more traditional straw bale assemblies that employ both interior and exterior plasters. As such, evaluating the performance of different plaster compositions (e.g. clay, lime, cement-lime), particularly their effect on the moisture characteristics of advanced straw bale assemblies, is worthy of investigation.
