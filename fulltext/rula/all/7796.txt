Masters of Planning In Urban Development Ryerson University

Abstract: One of the main issues faced by the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) is the poor structural condition of its aging school buildings. As of school year 2016/2017, the total renewal/repair backlog for all of TDSB schools has reached $3.4 Billion, with approximately 103 TDSB schools operating at a 65% or lower utilization rate (TDSB, 2014f). There is an immense pressure on school boards, particularly the TDSB, to sell off schools that have been declared as surplus (Mangione & Suen, 2015). However, the selling of school properties that have a high social and economic value is not a sustainable approach for the long run. Hence, there is a need for an effective and resilient planning strategy that will efficiently address the issues faced by the TDSB. As a result, this research will be recommending a land assessment tool that will efficiently repurpose and redevelop school properties, in critical condition, into community hubs and replace old and deteriorating TDBS schools with newer school facilities.

1. Chapter 1: Introduction 1.1. Nature of the Study

One of the main issues faced by the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) is the poor structural condition of its school buildings. As of school year 2016/2017, the total renewal backlog for all TDSB schools reached $3.4 Billion. In addition, numerous TDSB schools are currently underutilized, with approximately 103 TDSB schools at a 60% or lower utilization rate. With a declining student enrollment rate, the TDSB receives less funding for operating costs (TDSB, 2014f). In terms of building age, the average age of a TDSB school building is 60 years of age, with 80 schools older than 90 years, and 7 of which were built before the 1900s. Ontario's Education Minister, Liz Sandals, has stated that the province spends more than $1 billion on under-utilized schools across all Ontario school boards. Considering that it is the largest school board in Canada, the TDSB has the majority of these under-utilized schools across the province. As a result, there is immense pressure on school boards, particularly the TDSB, to sell off schools that have been declared as surplus. (Mangione & Suen, 2015). Trustees voiced their concerns that some of these under-utilized schools are not only used by students, but also used by the surrounding community for other purposes. And considering the prime real estate of these school properties, there is a concern that selling these properties without a deeper investigation of their true community value will result in a great loss for the neighbourhood in the long run (Brown & Rushowy, 2015). This issue faced by the TDSB is currently being experienced by cities on a much larger scale. Approximately 370 cities around the world are currently faced with an urban planning phenomenon known as the shrinking cities (Lee & Sung, 2017). According to Hollander (2011), shrinking cities refers to urban areas experiencing a decline in their population. The negative impacts associated with shrinking cities is economic instability, declining labor and employment opportunities, and, most relevant to this research, the under-utilization and even vacancy of public buildings and properties. However, Hollander explains that situations like these truly show how resilient and versatile planning is when it comes to addressing these issues. Rather than attempting

to reverse the issue, planning should be a flexible tool that is able to plan for the community and land use needs of a city with a smaller population. And although Toronto's population is not in decline, its schools are experiencing a decline in student enrollments. Hence, there is a need for an effective and resilient planning strategy that will efficiently address the issues faced by the TDSB in terms of under-utilization and deteriorating school buildings. At the same time, this will provide an opportunity to present students, parents, and surrounding communities with a socially and economically suitable alternative to simply selling public asset properties for a maximum revenue. The "how" of this research will be discussed in further detail in section 1.2 of this chapter.

1.2.

The Research

The purpose of the research is to develop a land assessment tool that will efficiently repurpose and redevelop surplus school lands into community needed infrastructure, services, and/or amenities and replace old and deteriorating TDSB schools with newer school facilities. The strategy will be presented in the form of a 5-step assessment process. Each step of the assessment will be informed by current land disposal practices from other jurisdictions, case studies, and from previous research. The land disposal assessment considers factors that go beyond the physical school property itself. These factors include looking into the area demographics, existing services and amenities in the area, and conducting a planning due diligence of the school property and other properties surrounding it. By understanding these factors that go beyond the physical building or property, this allows for the TDSB, the City, students and parents, community members, and possibly the private sector to identify the highest and best use for this property that would maximize the benefits for each stakeholder group.

1.2.1. The Scope of the Study The main focus of this study will be on the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) within the City of Toronto, the largest school board in Canada and one of the largest in North America. The TDSB is currently operating approximately 588 schools across Toronto in order to accommodate more than 246,000 students and approximately 160,000 life-long learners in Adult and Continuing Education programs. In total, 12.5% of Ontario's student population attend TDSB schools. In other words, it is one of the largest school districts within Ontario. And with a large student body population to teach, the TDSB's mission is to enable and provide all of its students with tools, resources, and an environment that enables them to "reach high levels of achievement and to acquire knowledge, skills, and values they need to become responsible members of a democratic society" (TDSB, 2014c).

1.2.2. Research Structure Chapter 2: Context This section will begin by taking a deeper look into the issues that the TDSB is currently facing. This chapter will also provide a detailed overview of the current approaches the TDSB has taken to manage and deal with under-utilized, deteriorating, and aging school properties. Chapter 3: Literature Review This section will look at the general topic of under-utilized or vacant public properties/assets from an urban planning lens. It will begin by understanding the shrinking cities phenomenon and what role planning should and should not be playing to address these urban issues. The chapter will transition into exploring some of the practices being followed by other jurisdictions when it comes to assessing and disposing of public assets, more specifically surplus school properties. Chapter 4: Methodology As mentioned in section 1.2, this research will be proposing an assessment tool that will identify and prioritize school in critical condition, and that will the determine the highest and best use for the property. This chapter will introduce the Surplus School Land 5-step assessment tool. Each step or phase of the assessment will be broken down, explaining the specific factors that need to be considered and how each step is to be carried out.

Chapter 5: Analysis This chapter will apply the 5-step assessment (outlined in Chapter 5 of the report) to 4 school properties that have been identified to be in "critical condition" in phase 1 of the assessment. This will provide an example of how the assessment would perform if it were to be put into action. Chapter 6: Limitations This chapter will outline some of the limitations found in the approach of this research and in the assessment, itself. Chapter 7: Conclusion This chapter will provide concluding thoughts on the land current land disposal process and the proposed 5-step assessment tool.

2. Chapter 2: Context 2.1. TDSB School Conditions

As mentioned earlier, one of the major issue currently faced by the TDSB is its deteriorating and aging school buildings. A quarter of TDSB schools are considered to be in critical conditions (Sachgau, 2016a). Currently, the TDSB is dealing with schools that have issues such as leaky roofs, old boilers, and broken AC units. It is important to note, however, that while schools are in deteriorating condition, this does not mean they are unsafe for students to attend. Anything that may be a threat to the students' safety, is addressed immediately. However, this also does not mean that the root of the issue is being dealt with, rather the issue is patched up and kept "under control". A parent, quoted in a Toronto Star article, indicates that issues, such as leaky roofs, are being patched up and temporarily fixed, rather than replacing the roof altogether. Trustee for Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Pamela Gough, stated that due to limited funds, there is only so much that can be done in terms of fixing and replacing school building equipment and parts (Sachgau, 2016a). To further understand the extent of the problem, this section will be looking at the following four major categories: renewal backlog, the facility condition index (FCI), utilization rate, and building age. 2.1.1. Renewal Backlog As of September 2017, the total value of repairs is approximately $3.7 billion. This consists of 22,686 different repairs needed for 583 TDSB schools. And while this backlog does not reflect or represent the health or safety of the school, it is an issue that needs addressing nonetheless1. Robin Pilkey (2017), the Chair of the TDSB, states in a letter to the Provincial government that without adequate and consistent funding, the TDSB's renewal backlog is predicted to reach $5.6 Billion in the year 2028 (TDSB, 2015a).

Expenditure

Figure 1: Annual Renewal Backlog and Project Expenditures (Source: Data provided by TDSB's Design, Construction & Maintenance Department)

To put this into perspective, to build an elementary school (Grades JK to 8) it costs approximately $1,959.89 per square metre, and with the average facility size of an elementary school within the City of Toronto being approximately 7064 square metres, this means it costs approximately $14 million (more or less) to build one elementary school in Toronto. To build a secondary school (Grades 9 to 12), it costs approximately $2,138.08 per square metre, and with the average facility size of a secondary school being approximately 7080 square meters, the cost of building one secondary school in Toronto is approximately $15 million. Hence, with a current backlog of $3.7 billion, the TDSB can build approximately 264 elementary schools or 246 secondary schools.

Referring to Figure 1 (above), the graph shows the renewal backlog for each school year (red) and the annual provincial funding allocated for project expenditures (blue). It is important to note that the province provides grants and funding specifically dedicated towards school renewal and repair projects. For school year 2016-2017, the TDSB received a total of $261.5 million (Sekaly, 2016). However, due to the high volume of needed repairs and the short time period to complete these repairs (most work tends to be done over the summer when students are out of school), the TDSB was only able to spend $140 million that school year (refer to Figure 1). This means that only 54% of the allocated funding was spent that school year, and it only covered 4% of the $3.4 billion backlog. For school year 2017-2018, the province provided the board with a $297 million grant. It is expected that $50 million should be used to replace energy efficient building components. The

remaining of the grant ($247 million) should be used to replace/repair building components, with hopes of it reducing the FCI of school buildings (refer to section below for the definition of FCI)1. This means that, if the funding were to be spent as indicated above, this will only reduce the overall renewal backlog by 8%. A Torontoist article suggests that the TDSB should explore different funding options such as increase in taxes, issuing bonds, or using educational development charges (EDCs)2. However, the bottom line many people and organizations are reaching is that there needs to be an increase in provincial grants and funding in order to reduce the backlog. And while the province's attempt to address growing repair backlogs for Ontario school boards was to increase funding to $1.1 billion for 2016-2017 school year, it is not sufficient to solve the problem or significantly reduce the TDSB's $3.7 billion backlog (Sachgau, 2016b). The need for funding is a fair request from school boards, however, it is also not a realistic or sustainable solution to address the TDSB's growing backlog, considering that there is only so much money that can go around each year to each school board in Ontario. This further proves that there is a need for a new and improved strategy that will reduce the TDSB's renewal backlog issue. 2.1.2. Facility Condition Index (FCI) The facility condition index or FCI provides each school a rating based on its structural condition. The FCI is a percentage calculated by dividing the renewal backlog by the total cost of replacing/rebuilding a school (FCI = Repair costs/ Rebuilding costs3). According to the Ministry of Education ranking system, schools with an FCI greater than 65% are better off being rebuilt, rather than spending money and resources on repairs. Schools with an FCI of 100% or greater means that repair costs are equal to or higher than the cost of rebuilding the school. The FCI is updated when the school's backlog is updated/adjusted, which occurs every 5 years (TDSB, 2014d). It is important to note that the FCI does not reflect the safety of the school building.

© SAFIYYAH OMAR SALEH 7

According to the 2016 TDSB dataset4, it has been identified that 98 elementary schools5 and 23 high schools6 had an FCI equal to or greater than 65% (TDSB, 2014). In other words, the TDSB is currently spending funding and resources on repairs within schools that are identified and assessed to being unrepairable and are better off rebuilt from scratch. If these 121 schools were to be replaced with newer school facilities, this would potentially eliminate a grand total of $1.3 billion from the renewal backlog (i.e. elementary schools = $752.9 Million; high schools = $557.7 Million).

2.1.3. Utilization Rate 2.1.3.1. Under Capacity

It is important to understand that even with high renewal backlogs, this does not necessarily mean that the TDSBs resources and schools are being utilized at full or over capacity. According to the 2016-2017 dataset, 129 TDSB schools (approx. 22%) are currently operating at a utilization rate7 of 65% or lower. The pupil accommodation review indicates that schools that are operating at a utilization rate of 65% or lower and it is projected to remain so for the next 5 years, they are considered to be under-utilized and need to be assessed for potential closure (TDSB, 2014). A school in "good" standing in terms of enrollment should have a minimum utilization rate of 80% to 90% (TDSB, Long-term program, 2016b). In 2015, the Ontario Education Minister, Liz Sandals, has requested from the TDSB to provide a list of schools that are considered to be under-utilized and to start the process of assessing these schools for potential closure. However, Brown and Rushowy (2015) explain that the province's measure cannot be applied on every school without considering additional factors. For example, Burnhamthorpe Collegiate Institute is operating at a 35% enrollment rate, however, this calculation does not include the approximately 1,000 adult students going back to school to get high school credits because they are identified as "adults" in the system (Brown & Rushowy, 2015). Even after

The 2016-2017 TDSB dataset can also be found in Appendix A. Toronto has many different types of elementary schools, with different grade ranges. Some elementary schools range from Jk to

grade 5, JK to grade 8, JK to grade 4, etc. This particular statistic includes these schools. However, this does not include schools that go from grade 4 to 8, grade 6 to 8, or grades 1 to 5. 6 These statistics includes schools that have grade ranges such as grade 9 to 12, grades 10 to 12, and grade 7 to 9.

providing a list of "under-utilized" schools, trustees warned against the ministry from taking any quick decisions solely based on the "utilization rate" calculation alone. Trustee Ausma Malik explained that some of the schools are being also used as community hubs, however under the ministry's formula, they appear to be "near-empty" (Brown & Rushowy, 2015). 2.1.3.2. Over Capacity

On the other hand of the argument, there are a number of TDSB schools that are operating at overcapacity. According to the 2016-2017 dataset, 127 schools are currently operating at 100% capacity or greater (TDSB, 2014). According to an advocate group known as Fix Our Schools, explains that overcapacity schools operate extremely efficiently and they save the province a lot of money (Fix Our Schools, 2015). However, these schools are also not ideal learning environments for students. School staff are working all around the clock, spending time and energy on managing logistics rather than investing more time and energy into providing students with top quality learning experience. The group states that organizing an event such as a school assembly or a concert can be a mission impossible considering the large volume of students they need to coordinate and manage. And due to limited or no space at all, if a classroom is going through repairs, students, in some cases, must have their class in the hallway. In addition, caretakers and cleaning staff are working around the clock to ensure an overcapacity school is kept in good cleaning condition, and this can have a wear-and-tear effect on the school's facilities (Fix Our Schools, 2015). The issue of over capacitated schools also stems from soaring condominium developments in certain parts of the City. There are several cases where new families are moving into a newly built development in an area and their child(ren) is(are) unable to register at the neighbourhood's local school due to overcapacity, and are bused to a further location. The TDSB has asked developers to insert a "warning clause" alerting potential buyers that their children may not be able to attend the local public school in their area (Otis, 2015). Hence, identifying and understanding the utilization rate of a school is necessary for the development of a new planning strategy or assessment, since these rates fluctuate each year for various reasons, which need to be taken into

account. It is also important to consider enrollment or utilization rate projections for the next 5 years8.

2.1.4. Building Age As mentioned earlier, the TDSB renewal backlog is currently at $3.4 billion and continues to grow. A main contributor to the growth of the backlog is the aging TDSB school buildings. According to the TDSB (2014d) website, the average age of a TDSB school building is over 60 years of age, with 80 schools older than 90 years, 7 of which were built before the 1900's (TDSB, 2014a). This means that building components are also aging and require continuous repairs or complete replacement.

2.2.

Concerns with Current Process

In order to understand the current land disposal of surplus school properties process and the concerns and barriers that surround this process, section 2.2 will be divided into two parts. The first part of the section (2.2.1. Current Process) will talk about who carries out the assessment, the factors considered within the assessment, and the provincial regulations in place to guide this assessment. The second part of this section (2.2.2. Concerns & Barriers) will discuss the concerns and barriers that surround this very process. This will include concerns and issues expressed on the municipal level, the inability of the TDSB to access certain development revenue tools, and the current strategies in place to possibly address these issues (and why they may not be effective). 2.2.1. Current Process i. Toronto Lands Corporation

Toronto Lands Corporation (TLC) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the TDSB, and was incorporated on April of 2008. TLC manages the TDSB's leasing and selling portfolio for school properties that have been declared surplus. Their main objective is to maximize the income/revenue gathered on properties, whether that income comes from the sale of the property or from leasing it. Once the school property has been declared surplus by the TDSB, the property

is passed on to TLC in order to begin the land disposition process outlined under O. Reg. 444/98 (TLC, 2014). As their mission statement suggests, TLC does not only aim to sell and lease surplus school properties. The corporation seeks to find new and innovative strategies to provide a quality education experience for TDSB students and ensure that the economic and social value of a school property is maximized through the management, redevelopment, and/or the sale of surplus school properties (TLC, 2014).

ii.

Pupil Accommodation Review

The process of identifying the level of deterioration can be brief or thorough, depending on the property in question. In order for a TDSB school to be determined as surplus, the school must go through a Pupil Accommodation Review. A system or assessment such as this is applied to schools that are underutilized or closed schools. The process involves several steps including the establishing of a Pupil Accommodation Review Committee, presenting of an initial staff report, holding public consultations providing the opportunity for community participation, school staff engagement, and providing a final report (TDSB, 2009). Refer to Appendix B for the full Pupil Accommodation and Program Review document. In certain scenarios, a shortened/ modified version of the Pupil Accommodation Review Process can be applied. The initial staff report must present a rationale for exempting the school from conducting the full-length assessment process9. The rationale must include one or more of the following factors and must meet the parameters listed below each factor (TDSB 2009): 1) Enrollment a. An elementary school with an enrolment equal to or less than 150 students for the current school year, and is projected to continue to have low enrolment levels for the next 5 years b. A secondary school with an enrolment equal to or less than 350 students for the current school year, and is projected to continue to have low enrolment levels for the next 5 years

In this case, once the modified pupil accommodation review process is approved, a committee is not established.

2) Utilization rate a. A school with a utilization rate of 65% or lower, and projections show that it will remain low for the next five years 3) Facility condition a. Schools repairs require large amounts of capital investments b. When the facility condition index deems the school prohibitive to repair 4) Distance a. Walking distance to the nearest public school to accommodate students from the school being considered for closure. Walking distance is based on the TDSB's Transportation of Students policy P02010 : · · · Walking distance for JK to grade 5: less than 1.6 km Walking distance for grades 6 to 8: less than 3.2 km Walking distance for grades 9 to OAC: less than 4.8 km

For full details of the TDSB Pupil Accommodation Review, refer to Appendix B. iii. O. Reg. 444/98 Disposition Real Property

When a school is identified as surplus by the TDSB, it becomes the responsibility of Toronto Lands Corporation. The property goes through O. Reg. 444/98 Disposition Real Property, which is a 180day process that begins when a school property is declared as a surplus. In the first 90-days, other school boards, non-profit organizations, or the City are given priority to express interest in the surplus school property. After the first 90 days (i.e. 3 months) have passed, interested public agencies have another 90 days to present a proposal for the property stating their plans for the property. The property is either leased or sold at fair market price. If within the 180 days, no interest has been expressed from any of these agencies or an agreement has been reached with a public organization, the property is put on the open market for developers to purchase it. And while the funds collected from selling the land help support other schools in the district, there have been concerns raised about the closure and disposition of school properties.

2.2.2. Concerns & Barriers i. Municipal Concerns with School Land Disposal

In a Staff Report, the City of Toronto expressed its concern with school closures happening due to ageing school building and changing student population. The report states that the City is not opposed to the sale of school properties, however it encourages the school board to consider the social and community value of the property. Some school properties hold a great value for the surrounding community and neighbourhood, that surpasses the physical economic value of the property. Losing these properties can have a negative impact on their well-being. The discussion of school closures and the sale of school properties has become a great concern for the City and the community. As mentioned earlier in a 2016 Staff Report, the City of Toronto expressed their concern with the speed at which school properties are being sold at. They had stated that while there is a designated reserve fund for the purchasing of school properties, it is no longer able to continue to purchase these properties at fair market value with only $6 million remaining in the fund. This is seen as an issue particularly for school properties that support public infrastructure and provide community services for the local neighbourhood. In addition, the moment these properties are taken out of public ownership, it becomes increasingly difficult for the public sector to utilize these properties for community use. The staff report provides recommendations in order to mitigate this issue. Their main recommendation is to have the Province of Ontario play an active role in coordinating the process of identifying and acquiring TDSB properties that "represent valuable public infrastructure". This infrastructure includes facilities that deliver provincially funded services, including mental health services, child and youth services, and community and social services. However, holding on to a school identified as surplus is also not financially or socially viable. Even with the school shut down, it needs to be maintained and inspected regularly in order to ensure that it is not vandalized, destroyed, or broken into. And to ensure that there are no issues with the building utilities, such as electrical wiring potentially starting a fire or a water pipe bursting during the winter. Accidents and emergencies such as these become more likely for extremely old school that are in critical structural conditions. This is an additional cost the school board must cover for something that is not providing any value for the surrounding community,

which could have been otherwise invested into other projects and programs. For example, the school board in Milwaukee in the US spent more than $1 million annually maintaining its 27 surplus schools (DCG Strategies, n.d.). Hence, it is clear that balance needs to be established when dealing with surplus school properties, ensuring that these properties are not easily sold off and that taxpayer money is not being invested into a black hole. ii. Education Development Charges (EDCs)

EDCs are a source of funding that school boards can receive by charging new development within close proximity to their schools. EDCs allows school boards to charge developers a percentage and allows them to purchase land to build more schools to accommodate the influx of new students into a particular area. Boards are not allowed to spend EDC funds on the building/construction of a new school or renovating an existing one. In the case of Toronto, the TDSB is not qualified to collect EDCs because its schools are not operating at full capacity (i.e. low student enrollment/utilization rate). As mentioned earlier, certain parts of Toronto have experienced an increase in high-density, vertical residential development over the past decade. This has resulted in an influx of new residents entering Toronto neighbourhoods and it is projected that there will be 214,000 new residential units over the next 15 years, which has and will continue to cause pressure on TDSB schools. Currently, the TDSB has adopted accommodation strategies in order to manage the enrolment growth at some of its schools. These strategies include using portables, relocating new students to schools further away from their home schools, and the changing of school boundaries (TDSB, 2014e). However, these strategies are not enough to address the root of this issue. Councillor Mike Layton has expressed that students attending over-capacity schools in fast growing neighbourhoods should not be penalized just because schools in other parts of the city are operating under-capacity (Gordon, 2017). Currently, the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB) is one of the school boards in Toronto that is able to tap into this source of funding. However, due to the spending restriction that EDCs place on school boards, it has not been a complete benefit for the TCDSB. A Toronto Star article explains that since EDCs can only be used to purchase land for new schools, this can
© SAFIYYAH OMAR SALEH 14

be hard for school boards located in Toronto due to the limited amount of vacant land in in the City (Gordon, 2017). As a result, the TDSB has been and continues to advocate for the Ontario Government to amend the EDC regulations under the Education Act, in order to allow the TDSB to use this tool and possibly use these funds to solve its ever-growing renewal backlog (TDSB, 2014e). Nonetheless, the TDSB is aware that the ability to access EDCs is not a permanent solution to address their renewal backlog and deteriorating school buildings issue. There is a need for a new and improved "funding strategy to reduce" the TDSB's "Renewal Needs Backlog and maintain and operate" its schools (TDSB, 2014e).

iii.

Better Schools, Brighter Futures Program

In 2012, the TDSB had established a program called the Better Schools, Brighter Futures. The program was developed for the purpose of addressing the need for better and advanced programming, to address the declining student enrollment, the need to replace aging school building structures with new and innovative facilities, and the current pressures on both the operating and capital TDSB funding (TDSB, 2014f). As mentioned earlier, the Toronto Lands cCorporation is a subsidiary of the TDSB and they manage the leased TDSB properties and are responsible of disposing properties that are declared surplus by the school board. The launch of this new program gained TLC the approval from the Ministry of Education that allows them to invest any funds collected from leasing or from disposing/selling of land into renovating existing schools or invested into building new school facilities that replace the older ones (TDSB, 2014f). However, when considering the pace at which the TDSB's renewal backlog is growing, the long list of deteriorating and aging schools, and the selling of 60 plus TDSB properties, there is still a need for more work to be done. And while this program sets the goals and principles for how TDSB properties should be assessed, there is still no clear tactical plan that can put this program into motion.

And while O. Reg. 444/98 provides a step by step process of school land disposition after it has been declared as surplus by the TDSB, it does not provide any guidance on how to select the ideal tenant or buyer for the land and ensure that the proposed development replaces previous public services and improves the overall well-being of the surrounding community and neighbourhood11. There is a need for an action plan that can be followed or referenced when a property is being considered for the leasing or the procurement and for redevelopment.

2.2.3. Community Hubs Initiative In May of 2016, the Ontario government announced that surplus school properties can be considered for the placement of a community hubs or any other public services, while also ensuring that the school board receives "good economic value for the property". This initiative has been called the Community Hub Action Plan. Locating community hubs on surplus school properties is seen as ideal, because it is easily accessible to the surrounding neighbourhood and community (Carroll, Pasquino, Haile, 2016a). This is an example of a provincial initiative to address the issues some school boards are currently facing (including the TDSB), such as the declining public school enrollment, aging school buildings, and the ongoing increase of renewal/repair backlog (Carroll, Pasquino, Haile, 2016). It is part of the Ontario government's initiative to foster collaborations between different government bodies and agencies to achieve cost efficient and effective delivery of services to diverse communities and neighbourhoods (Carroll, Pasquino, Haile, 2016b). The Community Hub Action Plan addresses and attempts to solve challenges relating to planning, integrated service delivery, and community infrastructure/ public properties. This allows organizations to address these issues without waiting for legislative or policy changes to happen (Carroll, Pasquino, Haile, 2016b). The use of the term "community hub" for this initiative is brilliant and most ideal. The term "community hub" does not have a specific definition, model, or requirements. According to

11

Note that the buyer is to be selected or negotiated after the land had been off the market for 90 days so that school boards and non-profit organizations are given a chance to put in an offer on the property.

MPAC, community hubs are service delivery models, bringing a wide range of services and amenities to a neighbourhood to satisfy the needs and priorities of the surrounding community. These services and amenities can include affordable housing, recreational services, health clinics, legal aid, settlement and employment services, and child care facilities, just to name a few (MPAC, 2018). Hence, a community hub is what the surrounding community defines it to be.

3. Chapter 3: Literature Review: 3.1. Shrinking Cities

3.1.1. Declining Populations & Under-utilized properties The issues the TDSB is currently facing in terms of declining student enrollment, low utilization rates, and aging and structurally deteriorating school buildings, are an example of a larger planning phenomenon that is occurring on a bigger scale for some cities around the world. This planning phenomenon is known as shrinking cities, which refers to the decline of population within a densely populated urban area (Hollander & Nemeth, 2011). The impacts of shrinking cities are not limited to a declining population, but also include an economic transformation such as a decline in employment and tax revenue. Another major impact or sign of shrinking cities, and that is relevant to this research, is the aging and under-utilization or abandonment of public buildings and properties (Lee & Sung, 2017). And while Toronto is not necessarily facing a decline in its population, the TDSB is currently faced with this issue when it comes to student enrollment. As mentioned earlier, approximately 22% of TDSB schools are currently operating at a utilization rate of 65% or lower. In addition, a large proportion of these schools have significantly aged and have deteriorated in condition. These schools have proven to becoming an economic and social burden on the TDSB, which has been discussed in length in Chapter 2 of this research. However, in order to deal with these issues, one of the strategies adopted by the school board is the selling of these school properties. Between 2008 and 2015, 67 schools have been sold by Toronto Lands Corporation (Altus Group, 2016). And while the sale of these surplus school properties has generated a substantial amount of revenue for the school board, there is a concern that these prime real estate properties will be lost and will be difficult, if not impossible, to retrieve or find something similar to it in Toronto's limited land inventory.

3.1.2. Planning: Public Redevelopment When attempting to understand the root reason for shrinking cities, there are several reasons for the causation of this planning phenomenon. This can include natural disasters, deindustrialization, suburbanization, globalization and the boom and bust of the economic cycle (Hollander & Nemeth,
© SAFIYYAH OMAR SALEH 18

2011). Nonetheless, regardless of what the reason maybe, what truly matters is how the issue is addressed and dealt with. Hollander (2011) explores a new planning phenomenon called smart decline, which is "planning for less, fewer people, fewer buildings, (and) fewer land uses" (Pg. 131). In other words, planning should be prepared for "social emergencies" such as these and must have a contingency plan that allows the city to adjust to these changes and make the best out of them, rather than work to reverse this phenomenon. City officials and planners should ensure that the city experiences an "effective shrinkage", which means that the number of abandoned buildings and vacant lots are controlled and minimized, and that there is a plan in place to convert them into other land uses, such as parks, recreational, retail and/or residential uses (Hollander, 2011). Hollander's (2011) article explains that the only option to addressing the issues caused by depopulation is to consider and rethink public redevelopment. The article states that the public redeveloping of a shrinking city aims to improve its overall economic conditions and it improves "the physical realm of an area" (Hollander, 2011, Pg. 130). However, public redevelopment may not be achievable for every single property due to limited resources and funds. As a result, with these demographic and urban changes and with limited funds, there is a need for a land use planning strategy and reforming of policies and regulations to address these issues in an efficient and cost-effective manner. 3.1.3. Benefits of a Declining City With under-utilized or abandoned properties, there is an opportunity to enhance the overall quality and public health of communities and neighborhoods. For example, there is the opportunity to install or enhance the green infrastructure within the neighbourhood, that otherwise would not be possible due to limited space and/or funds (Schilling & Logan, 2008). An example of a city that has experienced the shrinking cities phenomenon is the city of Youngston, in the state of Ohio. As the city's population declined, the Master Plan was adjusted to adopt this change and to plan for a "better, smaller Youngstown". Rather than focusing on

19

growing the city and attracting foot traffic, the updated plan aims to improve the quality of life for remaining residents (Hollander, 2011). The repurposing and redevelopment of underutilized public properties will provide social and economic opportunities for the surrounding community. Some of these benefits or opportunities include the replacement of aging infrastructure and structures with brand new buildings, allowing the board or city to eliminate any repair costs associated with that particular structure. It also opens up the opportunity to brainstorm creative ideas to repurpose and redevelop the property, ensuring that this time around community needs and gaps in servicing and housing are met or addressed (BC Housing, n.d.). The BC Housing article also indicates that it provides the opportunity to build environmentally sustainable structures. According to the Advisory Committee for School Repurposing and Community Development in Chicago, if a vacant property is repurposed or redeveloped in an effective and efficient manner, these buildings or sites can provide "opportunity and positive change" to the surrounding communities (Milhouse, 2014, Pg. 8). With that being said, the benefits and opportunities that are a result of repurposing a vacant public property, can take a different form and can extend beyond the above list, depending on the nature and the surrounding environment of the property. 3.1.4. The Need for Action Moreover, to summarize, the research on shrinking cities focuses on the benefits and value of this phenomenon and provides a general guideline of how planning should address issues such as declining populations and vacant public properties. However, similar to the TDSB's approach to addressing under-utilized deteriorating school buildings, there remains a missing discourse in regards to an action plan. And while Hollander (2011) states that a major strategy to addressing depopulation is rethinking public redevelopment, he does not provide any suggestions or recommendations on how this rethinking or redevelopment will look like and what is it trying to achieve exactly. Hence, there is a need for narrowed down recommendations, that can be customized for different geographical contexts, in which public officials can use as an action plan to act upon.

This research paper attempts to fill in this gap and add further dimension and direction on this issue of shrinking populations (or student enrollments for that matter) and deteriorating public buildings (or schools). This research paper proposes and explores a land assessment tool that will allow public officials to efficiently identify, prioritize, analyze and repurpose under-utilized or vacant public properties. It is important to note that this recommended tool is not the ultimate and only tool that will address the shrinking cities phenomenon and the issues associated with it. However, it does provide a starting point for public officials that want to take action to address issues of declining populations and deteriorating public properties. To further understand how this land assessment tool would look and function like, the next section will provide examples of cities and/or states using slightly different versions of this land assessment tool. These examples will also inform the structure and function of the assessment tool recommended/proposed for the TDSB in chapter 4 of this research.

3.2.

Repurposing and Redeveloping Assessment Practices

The repurposing and revitalizing of deteriorating, under-utilized, and vacant public assets is not a new phenomenon. Different jurisdictions follow different strategies and processes that work best for their communities. As a result, this section will be looking into various approaches and systems that different school boards and municipal governments, from different jurisdictions, follow when it comes to determining which pubic properties are in poor conditions and are physically, economically, and socially better off being rebuilt and repurposed. 3.2.1. Michigan In the state of Michigan, they have developed a guide for the repurposing of vacant and underutilized historic buildings. Similar to the TDSB, their guide allows public officials to develop a plan that will allow them to "identify, evaluate, market, and finance these buildings so they can...become valuable resources to the community" (Taylor, 2014, Pg. 2). Their process of repurposing vacant public assets begins by identifying and prioritizing buildings that are need of repurposing or redevelopment. This step of the assessment constitutes inspecting its architectural and structural integrity, including the roof, foundation, evaluating hazardous materials, safety features and accessibility infrastructure. This step is similar to identifying what the FCI is for the
© SAFIYYAH OMAR SALEH 21

building at the TDSB. This will ensure that resources are invested efficiently and effectively into properties that are most in need. However, unlike the TDSB, this assessment goes beyond the factors and parameters listed above by the TDSB. The community guide developed by the State of Michigan also explores whether the building is considered to be a "community anchor or local landmark" (Taylor, 2014). This step of the process considers the current social and community value of the property to the residents and neighbourhoods surrounding this property/building. This does not solely refer to the sentimental or nostalgic value that people tend to place on an old building or site they knew from a young age. It also refers to the public services this building provided the community and neighbourhood, such as a city hall, fire department, library, hospital or school (Taylor, 2014). In some cases, public schools provide more than just educational services. They also provide space that is utilized by the community for various reasons. Understanding this value is important because it sets a precedent or a standard of what the future repurposing project should provide for the area at the very least. The process or guide also explores whether the repurposing or redevelopment of the site will result in a financial return for the community. The return can be in the shape of housing, needed public services, jobs, or even the revitalization/rebuilding of the existing building (Taylor, 2014).

3.2.2. Chicago, Illinois In the state of Illinois, the Chicago Board of Education had requested from the Advisory Committee for School Repurposing and Community Development to develop a set of guiding principles and a proposed process for the repurposing/redeveloping of schools that have been identified as surplus by the school board. The document or guide developed by the Advisory Committee provides a guideline of "how to make the most efficient use of these properties in timely, financially viable ways that returned them to constructive use quickly" (Milhouse, 2014, pg 6). The initial step of the process the advisory committee conducts a physical and financial assessment/ review for each property. To determine what kind of uses and development can be proposed for the property, the city of Chicago considers a list of principles and criteria when

reviewing a development application/ proposal. Some of these criteria include ensuring that the proposers are able to carry out the project, the proposal project provides community support and benefits, the financial viability of the project, whether the proposal project complements the current character of the surrounding community, and ensuring there are employment opportunities during and after construction. 3.2.3. Columbia, Washington In the state of Washington, in the district of Columbia, the evaluation process for a surplus school is similar to the above US examples. However, the District of Columbia implemented a point system rubric to score potential tenants and buyers that are interested in the surplus school property. Some of the criteria on this rubric include Financial Feasibility (25 points), Project Vision and Implementation Plan (20 points), Demonstration of how the respondent will meet identified needs and provide equitable service (15 points), and Community Engagement and Access (15 points) (DME, 2017). This allows the board to rank school tenants or buyers based on the services they will provide that will benefit the community the most.

Toronto Case Studies

This section will present two Toronto case studies of schools declared surplus and the unique approach taken to repurpose and redevelop the properties to their highest and best use. 3.3.1. Bloor-Dufferin Project A well-known project underway at the moment is the Bloor-Dufferin redevelopment project. Two large high schools, Bloor Collegiate Institute (includes the Alpha 2 Alternative school) and Kent Senior Public School, located on the corner of Bloor Street and Dufferin, were determined to be surplus school properties in 2016. According to the 2016-2017 TDSB dataset, Kent Senior Public School was built in 1909, making it a 108-year-old building with a student capacity of 794. The building has an FCI of 160% and had a $16.1 million repair backlog. The Kent Senior Public School is also designated as a historical building. As for Bloor Collegiate Institute, it is a 101-yearold school with a student capacity of 792 students. The school had an FCI of 77% and a renewal backlog of $19.5 million (TDSB, 2014). After going through the policies and regulations outlined in O. Reg. 444/98, the TDSB was seeking a proposal for the repurposing of the 7.3-hectare site. Once the successful proponent, Capital Developments and Metropia, was selected to redevelop the site, the public consultation process began. The final proposed project for the property was 2,219 residential units, retail space, office space, and community space. The development will also include a new public park and the creation of two new north-south streets. The 3-storey historic Kent school will be retained and restored and is proposed to be converted into a 30,000-square foot community hub, that will include space for a day care, on the main and basement floor, and office space on the second and third floors (Harrison, 2018). Adjacent to the Bloor-Dufferin site is Brockton High School, located at the northeast corner of Croatia and Brock Street. On December 2016, the Government of Ontario announced that it will be providing $20 million in funding for the construction of a new secondary school that will accommodate approximately 900 students. The funds provided by the Ontario government are

24

expected to be spent on the construction of a new 30,000 square feet community hub, providing space for a child care centre and for community programming (Mirabelli, 2017). This project is a perfect example of a public private partnership, between the city, the school board, the developer, and most importantly with the surrounding community. Understanding the needs of each of these stakeholder groups allowed for an informed negotiation resulted in benefits for each group. As part of the procurement of the site, the Toronto Lands Corporation12 negotiated with the developer to include a community hub. This is seen as an innovative and ground-breaking procurement process. From a financial standpoint alone, the redevelopment project also includes the replacement of two aging schools, which eliminates a total of $35.6 millions of renewal backlog. The purchase price for the site was $121 million, which can be reinvested into other TDSB school buildings/properties that are identified as a priority. 3.3.2. Midlands and Lawrence School Property This project involves the consolidation of two high schools: Bendale Business and Technical Institute at 1555 Midland Avenue in Scarborough, and David and Mary Thomson Collegiate Institute at 2740 Lawrence Avenue East also in Scarborough. There is approximately 1 km distance between the two schools which equates to a 10-minute walk. After the property had been declared as surplus and has gone through the disposal process outlined under O. Reg. 444/98, the Midland and Lawrence school property has been approved for a new project proposal. The TDSB is currently in the process of beginning the construction of a new school, a modern track and field facilities, and providing additional community walkways. In addition, the two separate parcels on the property, one at 7.6 acres and the other at 9 acres, have been sold for residential redevelopment (TLC, n.d.). This project is another example of a mixed used development. If we look at the statistics for each school, it provides us with a better understanding of what the TDSB, students and parents gained from this agreement. For Bendale Business and Technical

Institute, according to the 2016-2017 dataset, the school has an FCI of 70% and a renewal backlog of $18.2 million. The school had a capacity of 945 students however it was only being utilized at a rate of 43%. Looking at the utilization rate projections for the next 5, 10, 15, and 20 years, the rate remains between 42% and 43%. As for David and Mary Thomson Collegiate Institute, the high school has an FCI of 77% and a backlog of $31.2 million. The school had a capacity of 1623 students however it was only operating at a utilization rate of 60%. According to the 5, 10, 15, and 20 years student enrollment projection, the student enrollment utilization rate decreases and ranges between 52% and 55% (TDSB, 2014). The new school facility will be accommodating students from both high schools, a total of 1500 students from grades 9 to 12. Considering that it is only a 10-minute walk between the two schools, the consolidation of the two properties makes it viable for students from both high schools. The school has 4 floors, with classes dedicated from science labs, visual and media art rooms, construction technology, culinary art, and environmental sustainability. The construction of the school will be complete by September 201913. With that being said, the community will not only gain a new state-of-the-art high school, it will also be able eliminate two schools in poor structural conditions and high FCIs, and eliminate a combined repair backlog of approximately $50 million.

4. Chapter 4: Proposed Methodology for Surplus School Repurposing
After exploring the various methodologies and approaches taken by various jurisdictions, chapter 4 will be presenting the proposed methodology for effectively and efficiently repurposing surplus school properties. The assessment process consists of 5 steps/phases. The chapter will provide a detailed description of how each step/phase will be structured and carried out upon application.

4.1.

Pre-Assessment Phase

Before diving into the land assessment tool, there is a pre-assessment phase that needs to be established. Section 4.1 will be discussing the need for an advisory committee with members of various skills and expertise. And it will also discuss the benefits of having a public private partnership when it comes to repurposing/redeveloping a public asset. 4.1.1. Advisory Committee Similar to many of the land disposal processes mentioned in the previous chapter, including the TDSB, an advisory committee is needed in order to conduct a thorough assessment. Currently in Toronto, to carry out the Pupil Accommodation Review, a committee is formed to present an initial staff report on the property, hold public consultations for the community, school staff, and students, and providing a final report with recommendations on an action plan. The committee must include parent and guardian representatives from the school that is under review. However, it is not clear what kind of credentials these committee members have to conduct this process other than they are employees of the TDSB. In the City of Chicago, in their School Repurposing and Community Development Guide, they state that it is necessary to have an advisory review and evaluation committee with members of skills and knowledge that will be an asset and benefit for the overall process (Milhouse, 2014). The six members on this particular advisory committee should each have expertise in one of the following categories: · Community and Neighbourhood Planning o Expertise should be in planning, zoning, and land use, ensuring that proposals for repurposing and redevelopment are "consistent with existing plans for their
© SAFIYYAH OMAR SALEH 27

local areas, and are compatible with other neighborhood uses" (Milhouse, 2014, Pg. 14). · Community Benefit o This individual is to weigh in and identify the potential benefits (or lack of) the proposed project has for the surrounding area. The member is preferably from the neighbourhood development group or a community service provider. · Job Creation o This member would provide guidance and suggestions on potential job creation opportunities that can occur on the subject property. This includes job creation during and after the construction phase. · Economic Development o This member provides input on tax generation and other potential economic benefits. The member can be from the chamber of commerce, a real estate consulting firm, or from the City's department of planning and development. · Project Implementation o A person, which can be a non-profit or for-profit developer, would provide their expertise on the feasibility of implementing a particular proposal on the subject site. · Community Engagement o This person can be a parent or a community representative providing input and perspective of a local resident. Having each individual from the committee have at least one of these skills provides an informed discussion upon reviewing surplus school properties and reviewing future proposals for these sites. In addition, the Chicago advisory committee works closely with the Chicago Public School to develop criteria for proposals and to provide guidance on the community process (Milhouse, 2014, Pg. 14).

4.1.2. Public Private Partnership The purpose of Public Private Partnerships (PPP's) is to assist in the implementation and/or financing of a new project or business plan. This partnership allows for the costs and risks associated with a project, such as building public infrastructure or a public facility, to be shared among the public and private sector (ACEC, n.d.). In some cases, the public sector may not be able to deliver necessary services to the community in need within a timely matter due to limited resources and funds or is unable to pay for the maintenance of a service or facility. Hence, with a collaboration between the private and public sector, the City or anybody of government, can carry this service or project out without any delays and be assisted with the costs of operating and maintaining a property, facility, or service. With that being said, partnerships are not limited to the private sector. School boards are also encouraged to developing partnerships and collaborations with non-profit organizations. The Ontario Ministry of Education developed a guide that would promote more of this kind of collaboration. 4.1.2.1. Non-Profit Partnerships

To assist school boards in managing surplus school space, the province of Ontario has developed the Community Planning and Partnerships Guideline. This provides a framework for school boards that want to bring "a tenant or partner into a school or a portion of a school, on a cost recovery basis" (Ministry of Education, 2016, Pg. 5). These partnerships can include child care agencies, youth centres, settlement and health services, just to name a few (Ministry of Education, 2016). It is the responsibility of all levels of government to maximize the use of vacant/surplus school space and to determine the highest and best use for these properties. Having partnerships between schools and non-profit organizations can strengthen the role of schools within a neighbourhood, providing surrounding communities access to programming and facilities that they would otherwise not be able to access easily. Hence, the guide was established to encourage school boards to collaborate with other school boards and community organizations (Ministry of Education, 2015).

29

In terms of cost, the guide outlines that any operational and capital cost, such as administrative costs and property taxes, need to be charged to the partners. When it comes to new construction on the property, partners using or sharing the space are expected to pay and finance their share of construction as well. The guide states that cost details and expectations need to be made clear to future/potential partners (Ministry of Education, 2015).

4.2.

Phase 1: Identifying School Building Condition

Similar to the cases mentioned above, the first step of this strategy is to identify schools that are considered to be in critical conditions. Similar to what is outlined in the Modified Pupil Accommodation Review, this research will be using the same standards to identify schools that are considered to be in poor conditions. These include: the FCI, Building Age, and Utilization Rate. This research will also be considering an additional factor and that is the renewal backlog14 for the school. While the FCI gives the committee an indication whether the school should be maintained or replaced, the renewal backlog places a price tag on the repairs and maintenance the school is in need of to be in "good condition". Note that the Modified Pupil Accommodation Review also considers the walking distance between two schools. The walking distance factor will be considered in the Second Phase: School Consolidation. This phase can be used to prioritize which schools should be declared as surplus and/or for redevelopment. It is also important to note that the purpose of this phase is not to declare all properties in "critical condition" as surplus. Similar to the Bloor-Dufferin and Midland project, the objective of the assessment is to replace current school buildings, providing students with better school facilities, and an overall better learning experience. For each of the factors considered for Phase 1 of the assessment, parameters have determined and a scoring has been applied for each parameter. These parameters will be entered into a software called Baragar Solutions Systems which is discussed further in section 4.1.7.

As mentioned in the introduction, the renewal backlog is the said school's repair costs that have been accumulating over the years. In other words, any repair jobs that have not been completed in a certain school year, they get carried over to the next year and so on.

4.2.1. Facility Condition Index Based on the TDSB Capital Planning presentation (2015a) and the Accommodation and Program Review document (2016a), FCI is categorized and ranked in the following manner (blue columns):
FCI Good Fair Poor Critical FCI Rating Range FCI < 10% 10% < FCI< 30% 30% < FCI < 65% 30% < FCI < 65% Scoring 5 15 30 50

The orange column is the scoring that was applied to each category in Baragar. The lower scoring refers to schools in good standing/good condition. The higher scoring refers to schools in worse conditions. 4.2.2. Building Age The blue columns show how the variable was categorized and the orange columns shows the scoring for each category/group. The lower scoring refers to a newer/younger building and the high scoring refers to an older/aging building.
Building Age Good Fair Poor Critical Building Age Range 4 < BA < 30 30 < BA < 60 60 < BA < 90 90 < BA < 126 Scoring 5 15 30 50

Considering that majority of these are aging and are well above the 90-year mark, it is important to check whether the school is also designated as a heritage building. However, that will be discussed in further detail in Phase 2 of the assessment.

4.2.3. Utilization Rate The utilization rate was categorized as shown below (blue columns):
Utilization Rate Critical Poor Fair Good Utilization Rating Range UR < 65% 65% < UR < 80% 80% < UR < 100% 100% < UR Scoring 50 30 15 5

According to the Accommodation and Program Review, it focuses on schools with a utilization rate of 65% or lower (TDSB, 2016a). However, the document did not provide a category breakdown for schools with a utilization rate greater than 65%. As a result, the rest of the values have been categorized based on my interpretation of the data. The orange column is the scoring applied to each category, with the lower scoring referring to a school with high utilization rate, and a lower scoring referring to a school with a high utilization rate or low vacancy rate. 4.2.3.1. Enrollment Rate Projection

The following step, is to evaluate the student enrollment projection for each school. While a school may be identified as "under-utilized" based on the high-level evaluation proposed above (i.e. utilization rate lower than 65%), the following 5 years may indicate an increase in student enrollment projection and need for a school facility that will accommodate this increase. On the other hand, schools that may be identified as in "good standing" in terms of their enrollment rate (i.e. utilization rate greater than 65%) may experience a decreasing student enrollment rate in the next five years. There will also be a consideration for school properties with a utilization rate of 100% or greater. Over-populated schools tend to place pressure on its academic and extra-curricular programs. Hence, this evaluation will also look into the enrollment rate projections for these over-populated schools in order to understand if this high enrollment is due to certain circumstances that occur in one school year, or if this is an ongoing trend that needs to be addressed with a larger and newer school facility. This will be further explored in the school consolidation phase of this assessment.

4.2.4. Renewal Backlog
Renewal Backlog Good Fair Poor Critical Renewal Backlog Range RB < $5 M $5 M < RB < $10 M $10 M < RB < $15 M $15 M < RB Scoring 5 15 30 50

The renewal backlog variable was categorized as shown in the blue columns. The values were categorized/grouped in equal intervals. The lower scoring referred to a school with a low renewal backlog and the higher scoring referred to a school with a higher renewal backlog. 4.2.5. Baragar Systems The factors, parameters, and scorings described above will be entered into a geographic software known as Baragar Systems. This software specifically geographically maps out school catchments and any statistics related to that school. It allows for the user to geographically analyze data associated with each school by conducting queries using different factors. It functions similar to ArcGIS software; however, only data related to schools can be entered and analyzed on this software. Section 5.1 will demonstrate how the software is use and what it is capable of producing.

Phase 2: School Consolidation

4.3.1. Consolidation A major part of the process of repurposing/redeveloping a school site is understanding and being aware of other school properties within close proximity of the subject site. Before considering a property for repurposing/redeveloping, it is important to know what are the needs of schools surrounding the subject site, such as the need for additional space, the need for additional academic and extra-curricular programming, or the need for a completely new facility or building to replace an aging one. For example, in the state of Washington, in order to determine if a school is surplus, City Council must also consider the surrounding school area, including nearby enrollment, capacity, utilization rates, and academic programs (DME, 2017). By consolidating two aging schools, identified to be in "critical condition", the TDSB, students, and the surrounding

community gain many benefits: The TDSB is able to eliminate two aging schools (or more), both with high FCIs and repair backlogs; Students gain a new building with up-to-date technology, equipment, and new program opportunities; And with the redevelopment of the site, there is an opportunity to provide additional services that would benefit and satisfy the needs of the surrounding community. Once a school is identified as being in "critical condition" (i.e. identified in phase 1 of the research), this phase looks at surrounding school catchments and for the opportunity to consolidate with other schools. Schools that are within close proximity to one another and are also underutilized could be considered for consolidation, which means both schools would be combined onto one property, where a new school will be built. This will allow for the opportunity to build a completely new school building, providing students with a new school facility with advanced resources, technologies, and contemporary structural design. At the same time, the TDSB will be able to remove aging schools from its inventory and eliminating any repair backlog associated with each school. The selection of a suitable property for the purpose of combining/consolidating multiple schools will be based on factors such as location, land acreage, and walking distance to and from that location. The walking distance parameters are stated in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.1.2.. Through this process of consolidation, this will result in having a vacant school property, which takes the research to phase 3 of the analysis. 4.3.2. Heritage After identifying schools that are considered to be in poor conditions, it is important to identify which of these schools is declared as a heritage building. This will dictate whether the building can be completely replaced with a newer facility, or if the exterior walls and façade of the building are maintained while the insides are refurbished and upgraded. As observed from the Michigan repurposing guide in section 3.2.1, the state checks if the building on the subject property has been declared to being a historical/heritage building before considering it for potential redevelopment.

Phase 3: Social Scan

The social scan will review and analyze demographic data of the population living in the area surrounding the school property. This will provide a better understanding of who is living in the area and what their needs are in the area. Knowing who lives in the surrounding community allows for an informed decision making process when it comes to deciding the type of resources and services that should be invested in the future. Understanding and analyzing demographic data provides insight into the types of businesses that could move into the area, if the area is in need of employment or language services, if there is a demand for after school programming or space for non-profit organizations and so on (French, 2014). From a planning perspective, demographic data shapes the neighbourhood's Master Plans and zoning by-laws and regulations (French, 2014). This information will be based on an in-depth research of the Statistics Canada 2016 census data. As part of Phase 3 of the proposed assessment, school properties identified to being in poor condition (i.e. in Phase 1) will undergo an in-depth research and review of the following datasets: · · · · · · · Age and population Household Structure (single couples, married couples with kids, no kids, etc.) Race & language Income status Employment & Unemployment Rate Occupations Tenure Type (Home ownership, rental, affordable housing, co-op housing, etc.)

Phase 4: Community Scan

The community scan will analyse the available community/public services available and missing in the surrounding area. This type of assessment is conducted to collect data and analyse the community's problems and weaknesses, to identify the community's needs, to identify the services, resources and assets the community currently owns and has access to. This phase will also analyse and identify what services the subject school property provided to the community. This phase will ask questions such as: · · · Does the school run extra-curricular activities after school hours? Do community groups use the school building after school hours? What existing services and amenities does the area have within walking distance? Examples include (but not limited to) o Community Centre o Local and diverse businesses o Public and Green space o Grocery stores o Language and immigration centre o Employment centre and services o Medical clinics and/or hospitals o Child care services o Local restaurants and dining spots o Emergency services (ambulance, police department, fire department) · If not accessible within walking distance, are these services and amenities accessible via public transportation? It is important to have this phase come after Phase 3: Social scan in order to see if current services in the area are truly catering to the needs of the current neighbourhood population. For example, if majority of the population have children and are working parents, it may be reasonable to consider bringing in child care services or provide after school programming that provides homework/academic assistance for the students. As a result, the questions asked and investigated in this phase may shift and change depending on the school property.

It is important to note that using geographical data that locates the existing services within the area (i.e. secondary data) is not necessarily sufficient to truly capture the quality of these services. In order to truly understand the current quality and effectiveness of these services, an in-depth investigation needs to be done on a qualitative scale. In other words, based on a report by the Ontario Centre of Excellence for Child and Youth Mental Health, it suggests to conduct the community assessment and collect data from multiple groups living or providing services (private or public) within the area. These groups include health and human providers, government officials, community activists, businesses, and residents, just to name a few. The report suggests various methods such as looking into existing data, conducting surveys, interviews, consultations, observations, inventories, and so on (Ontario, 2013). Hence, this scan can be considered to be a "preliminary" scan to provide the committee a highlevel idea of the area's strengths, weaknesses, needs, and wants. The results accumulated from the community scan can assist in guiding upcoming public consultations, allowing for a slightly more narrowed down discussion on what the issues the area and its residents may be facing. Once, it has been established that further information is needed to determine the true issues the area is facing and its needs, an internal or external team can be appointed to conduct an in-depth community assessment.

Phase 5: Development Scan

In this stage of the analysis, a full planning due diligence review of the land will take place. Conducting a development scan or a planning due diligence of the property will identify the provincial and municipal regulations and policies that apply to the site (Halinski & Grover, 2010). The development scan will also identify zoning by-laws that dictate the permitted uses on the land, maximum/minimum density, size and height of the building, building setbacks, required parking spaces, just to name a few (Taylor, 2014). Nonetheless, understanding the overall provincial and municipal planning and zoning regulations and policies, allows the TDSB and the City to be aware of what kind of development could potentially go on the land. It also provides a heads-ups for the school board and the City of some of the zoning by-law amendments the developer will need to go through in order to gain approval for a certain use, to increase height/density, to deal with setback restrictions (Halinski & Grover, 2010). This sets realistic expectations for the proposed project timeline, potentially saving time and reducing risk for everyone. In the City of Toronto, the following searches are included in the conducting a planning due diligence (Halinski & Grover, 2010): 1. Provincial Policy Statement 2. Provincial Plans a. Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan b. Niagara Escarpment Plan c. Greenbelt Plan d. Greater Golden Horseshoe Growth Management Plan e. Parkway Belt West Plan 3. Official Plans a. Official Plan b. Secondary Plan(s) 4. Zoning By-laws

5. Committee of Adjustment Decisions (Variances) 6. Ontario Municipal Board Decisions 7. Heritage Act Designation or Listing 8. Conservation Authority Regulation 9. Municipal Ravine and Tree By-Laws 10. Municipal Demolition of Rental Housing Controls 11. Statutory Agreements Registered on Title 12. Legal Non-Conforming Status Enquiry As mentioned earlier, the process and procedure followed for each phase may be slightly different depending on the property in question. Hence, these searches provide a head start or guidance of how to apply or conduct the development scan or planning due diligence for the property, but it does not necessarily mean that these are the only questions that must be asked (Halinski & Grover, 2010).

Summary

The proposed tool attempts to effectively and efficiently repurpose and redevelop surplus school properties. The table below summarizes the proposed tool and the purpose of each step in the assessment.
Pre-assessment Phase Phase 1: Identifying School Building Conditions Establish advisory committee and potential private or non-profit partnerships This phase will identify schools that are considered to be in critical condition. The factors that will be considered to identify schools in critical conditions are the FCI, building age, utilization rate, and renewal backlog. The purpose of this phase is to establish a priority list of schools that should be catered to right away. Phase 2: School Consolidation Once a list of schools in "critical condition" have been complied, this phase looks at surrounding school catchments and for the opportunity to consolidate with other schools. The selection of a suitable property for the purpose of combining/consolidating multiple schools will be based on factors such as location, land acreage, and walking distance to and from that location. In addition, in this phase, we will also identify if the school property is designated as a heritage building.

Phase 3: Social Scan

In phase 3 of the assessment, demographic area for the communities and neighbourhoods surrounding the school will be reviewed and analyzed. Data collected for this phase will include age, population, household structure, immigration, language, income status, employment, and tenure type. This phase will provide the advisory committee a clear idea of who lives in the area and what their social and economic needs may be.

Phase 4: Community Scan

The community scan will analyse the available community/public services available and missing in the surrounding area. This phase will also analyse the role the school site in the area played for the community by identifying what services the school provided to the community. This phase will ask questions such as: Does the school run extracurricular activities after school hours? Do community groups use the school building after school hours? What existing services and amenities does the area have within walking distance? Examples include (but not limited to) Community Centres, libraries, Public and Green space and Grocery stores.

Phase 5: Development Scan

In this stage of the assessment, a full planning due diligence review of the school property will take place. The development scan will identify zoning by-laws that dictate the permitted uses on the land, maximum/minimum density, size and height of the building, building setbacks, required parking spaces, just to name a few (Taylor, 2014).

5. Chapter 5: Analysis
To grasp an idea of how this methodology or 5-step assessment would look like if applied in a real-world setting, this chapter will be applying the assessment to 4 adjacent school catchments. Note that this assessment will not investigate or explore every single dataset, service, amenity, and zoning policy related to this area. The purpose of this assessment is to provide an example of what it would look like if it were to be carried out in real life.

5.1.

Phase 1: Identifying School Building Condition

The factors and parameters outlined in phase 1 (section 4.3), were entered into Baragar Systems software. Using Baragar allows the user to conduct phase 1 for all schools at once, rather than entering in the data separately for each school. However, for the rest of the assessment, each property will need be assessed on a school to school basis. Hence, for the purposes of this study, this research will only focus on a cluster of adjacent school properties. Once the factors, parameters, and scores were overlapped, they resulted with the map in Figure 2 and 3 (below). Figure 2 shows a map of TDSB elementary schools and Figure 3 shows a map of TDSB high schools. For each map, the schools have been categorized into 4 different quartiles. The colour associated with each school catchment area indicates the amount of points that were assigned for that school, indicates the condition of the school. Schools in relatively "good condition" are in deep dark red and received a scoring between 20 and 65 points. Schools in relatively "fair condition" are in bright red and received a scoring between 65 and 80 points. Schools that are in relatively "poor condition" are in orange and received a scoring between 80 and 100 points. And schools that are in relatively "critical condition" are in bright yellow and received a scoring between 100 and 200 points. In other words, the greater amount of points, the worse the school's condition is. Since this type of assessment is unique of its kind, there are no parameters or thresholds that indicates what constitutes to being in good, fair, poor, and critical condition. As a result, I divided the final results into equal quartiles (i.e. each colour group has an equal number of schools).

5.1.1. Case Study: Area A As mentioned earlier, phase 1 can be applied to all properties. However, for phases 2 to 5, the assessment will be applied to specific school catchments. For this example, the assessment will be applied to school catchments in Area A that have been identified to be in "critical condition" (i.e. yellow catchments: schools with 100 to 200 points), which is circled in blue on Figure 2. The schools within the circled area and that will be considered for this example are the following: 1) Blacksmith Public School 2) Shoreham Public Sports & Wellness Academy 3) Gosford Public School 4) Firgrove Public School To see where these schools are exactly located, refer to the map in Figure 4 (below).

5.2.

Phase 2: School Consolidation

The first part of phase 2 is to determine if the schools, that have been identified to be in "critical condition", can be possibly consolidated onto one property. The second part of phase 2 is to identify if the school is designated as a historical or heritage building. Figure 4 (below) provides a geographical reference of where these schools are located relative to one another and the distance between each school. Table 1 (below) provides the following statistics for each school: grade range, land acreage, renewal backlog, FCI, current capacity, utilization rate, and building age. Before analyzing the statistics into depth, I will be identifying some obvious facts about these 4 properties. In terms of FCI, all 4 properties are well above the 65% threshold, which means no matter which school is consolidated, it will be a benefit for the TDSB and its students. None of the properties have a heritage designation, which makes sense considering that they are not too old in terms of age. The first factor that will be considered is the distance between each school. As established earlier, walking distance for an elementary school is anything less than 1.6 km. Schools 1, 2 and 3 are within walking distance of one another. However, school number 4 is too far for students coming from schools 1 and 2, hence it may not be a suitable option for consolidation. It is important to

44

note that with consolidation, the distance between some of the students' homes and the new consolidated school will increase, hence, it no longer is considered to be "walking distance". However, upon determining which schools are to be consolidated, the shortest distance between the schools should be selected or preferred. In terms of enrollment, schools 1 and 2 are both below the 65% utilization rate threshold. Also, when considering the enrollment/utilization rate projections for the next 5 years, school 1 is projected to decrease down from 63% to 56% and school 2 utilization rate is projected to decrease down from 51% to 44%. And while school 3 is well above the utilization rate threshold (80%), it is projected that in the next 5 years it will decrease to 71%. Hence, building a new school that accommodates the area's needs and accommodates two or more schools onto one property may be a suitable option to consider. There are different consolidation options that can be considered for Area A school catchments. It is important to note that the consolidation options below are solely based on numerical data. Once we go through phases 3 to 4, this decision may change. The each consolidation options are described as follows: Consolidation Option # 1 Schools 1 and 2 can be consolidated on either property (since both almost have the same size of land). The school will have a capacity approximately between 500 to 600 students and this will eliminate a total renewal backlog of approximately $14 million. Simultaneously, schools 3 and 4 can be consolidated onto one property as well. The new school will have a capacity approximately 750 to 800 students and will eliminate a total backlog of approximately $17.4 million. If this option of consolidation is implemented, this will allow for the TDSB to eliminate 4 deteriorating schools (with a high FCI) and eliminate a total backlog of $31 million.

Consolidation Option # 2 School 1, 2 and 3 can be consolidated onto school property 3 which has 6 acres of land. Since school 3 is located in the centre, between schools 1 and 2, it is seen as the most suitable for this

45

option of consolidation. This will mean the new school will have a capacity of approximately 800 students. By building a new school, the TDSB will be able to eliminate 3 schools, with a total backlog of $21 million, each with an FCI ranging between 70% and 90%. This will potentially free up two school properties, with a combined land acreage total of approximately 12 acres, opening up the opportunity for repurposing and/or redevelopment. Consolidation Option # 3 Schools 1 and 3 can be consolidated onto one school property. This will eliminate approximately $13 millions of renewal backlog. And this will free up approximately 6 acres of land.

Consolidation Option # 4 Schools 2 and 3 can be consolidated one property. This will eliminate approximately $16 millions of renewal backlog. And this will free up approximately 5 to 6 acres of land.

Phase 3: Social Scan for Area A

To conduct a social scan, demographic data for the communities surrounding the area will be analyzed. The demographic data will be based on the census tract in which the 4 schools listed above are located in. The census tracts that will be analyzed for Area A are 312.04, 312.05, 315.03, 316.01, 316.03, 316.04, 316.05, and 316.06 (Statistics Canada, 2016a). Figure 5 (below) provides a map of the census tracts that will be analyzed for this phase.

Age and population Table 2 below shows the overall percentage for each age group for all census tracts combined16. The total population of the area (i.e. combining population from each census tract) is 36,830 and the average age for the area is 37 years old. Looking across all age groups (except for age cohort 65 and older), they all have close percentages ranging between 5% and 8%. Ages 5 to 14 years old make up 14% of the area population, which is the min age group for elementary schools in the area. The working age group (i.e. 15 to 64 year olds) are the majority, consisting of 66% of the area population. The senior group (i.e. 65 years and older) make up 13% of the area16.

Household Structure This section looks at the general family structure in the area and it is based on the 2016 Census of Population Family Characteristics of Adults dataset. This dataset indicates that 49% of adults are married or are in a common-law relationship. Of those married couples, 32% do not have children and 68% have children. Single parent households (i.e. lone parent) make up 18% of the population. Single adults or adults that are not living with a family member or non-family member, make up 20% of the area's population17. It is clear that Area A predominantly consists of married couples with one or more children. This means that any future services, amenities, and or development should appeal to a growing family household. Immigration This section presents statistics about the percentage of people living in Area A that are identified as immigrants or non-immigrants. The immigration and language data is based on the 2011 National Housing Survey Income and Housing Dataset. According to the dataset, 63% of the area consists of individuals identified as immigrants and 37% are identified as non-immigrants. In terms of the mother tongue language, 53% of the Area A's mother tongue language is English and 46% has a non-official language as their mother tongue (i.e. not English). Only 1% of the area speaks French as their mother tongue language. Considering that the majority of Area A's population are immigrants and almost half of the area's population speak a language other than English, there needs to be consideration for amenities and services that cater to their needs. These services and amenities can include ESL classes, employment services, and cultural centres, just to name a few.

Income status Income levels for the area are based on the 2011 National Household Survey (NHS) Income and Housing dataset since 2016 is not available18. The data shown in Table 3 (below) is based on "After-tax income" of private households in 2010. According to Statistics Canada, the household income is the sum of the after-tax incomes of all members of that household. A private household refers to a person or a group of people who live in the same private dwelling and do not have a usual place of residence elsewhere in Canada. Referring to Table 3 (below), the income level with the highest percentage of residents are $20,000 to $29,999 and $30,000 to $39,999, both levels at 15%. The second highest is $60,000 to $79,999 at 14%. The third highest is $40,000 to $49,999 at 13%. It is clear that there is a greater percentage of residents that fall below or close to the poverty line. For reference, according to the Low Income Cut Offs (1992 base) After Tax chart (refer to the table in Appendix C), for the year 2008 and for urban areas with a population of 500,000 and over, a one-person household would be considered below the poverty line at an income of $18,373 or lower. For 2 to 4 person households, the cut off would be approximately between $22,000 and $35,000. And households for 5 to 7 persons (or more) have a cut off of approximately between $40,000 and $48,000 (Statistics Canada, 2015).

Employment & Unemployment Rate To further understand the income levels observed in the Income Status section, this analysis will also be analyzing the employment trends occurring in Area A and the surrounding environment. Starting at a larger scale, jobs in North York, which is where all 4 schools are located in, make up 2.6% of jobs in the City overall. According to the Toronto Employment Survey for 2017, 8 in 10 jobs in North York Centre are office jobs, which are approximately 33,000 office jobs (Toronto, 2018). However, the North York Centre saw an overall decrease of in the office, retail and manufacturing sectors. On the other hand, the centre has experienced a growth and increase in the service, institutional, and community and entertainment industries (Toronto, 2018). On a more focused scale, based on the 2011 National Household Survey Labour and Housing dataset, Area A has an employment rate of 48% and unemployment rate of 13.7%19. While the unemployment rate for Area A is low, however the employment rate is not that high. An

assumption for this current state can be identified by observing the employment activity in the area shown on the Employment Concentrations map in Figure 6 (below). The map shows that Area A is located directly to the right-hand side of a "Core Employment Area". The map shows that majority of the activity and employment is clustered mostly west of Highway 400. Hence, the census tracts used to collect this data would not be able to capture the employment activity occurring west of Area A.

Area A

Occupations Table 4 (below) provides a list of occupation industries that residents in Area A work in. This data is based on the 2011 National Housing Survey labour and housing data set19. The occupation or job sector with the highest percentage is sales and service with 28%. The second highest is trades; transport and equipment operators; and related occupations, with 20% and the third highest job sector is the manufacturing and utilities sector with 18%. While the manufacturing industry in the North York Centre has decreased in 2017, overall it is clear that it remains a predominant employment industry for Area A.

The tenure data will be providing data on the percentage of residents that own or rent their homes. According to the 2011 National Housing Survey labour and housing dataset, 36% of Area A residents own their homes and 64% rent their homes20. It is clear that there is large market for rental housing in the area. In addition, it is important to consider how much of the rental housing consists of affordable or subsidized housing. According to Statistics Canada, the definition of "affordable or subsidized housing" can include rent geared income units, social housing, public housing, government-assisted housing, non-profit housing, rent supplements and housing allowances (Statistics Canada, 2011). In the case of Area A, 31% of residents live in subsidized housing. Hence, in addition to the fact that there is a demand for rental housing, any future development should also consider some form of social housing.

Phase 4: Community Scan for Area A

This scan will observe services and amenities within close proximity to each of these schools. The data for this scan have been compiled from Toronto services map and google maps. i. Libraries

Referring to Figure 7 (below), there is only one library that is accessible to all four schools. The library is within 1.4 km from Firgrove, 1.6 km from Gosford, 1.7 km from Shoreham, and 2.5 km from Blacksmith.
Figure 7: Libraries (Toronto Maps v2, n.d.)

Social Services

In terms of social services, Area A has high accessibility to these types of services. These services range from child care services, pharmacies, chiropractors, Academic upgrading services, to immigration and refugee services. These social services appear as green circles on Figure 8 below. While these green circles are not labelled, upon clicking on each one, I noticed that all four schools had access to a child care centre, however all academic and immigration centres and services were clustered closer to Firgrove Public School.

Transportation

The major transit service available in the area is bus services. As suspected, these school properties do not have any form of public transit service (i.e. buses) stopping right in front of them. Students commuting to these properties will need to walk from the bus stop to their school. Bus service that runs along Jane Street (north-south) is bus 35 Jane. The 35 bus runs from Jane subway station to York University. This bus also stops at Pioneer Village subway station. Along Finch Avenue (west-east) bus 36 Finch West, and it runs from Finch subway station to the Woodbine Race Tracks. This bus also stops at Finch West subway station (TTC, 2018).

Phase 5: Development Scan for Area A

The development scan will provide a planning due-diligence for Area A. This particular scan will provide a high-level development scan and will not go into a detailed due-diligence analysis. However, upon applying this tool in a real-life scenario, it is highly recommended to conduct a full due diligence analysis in order to support future decisions relating to the subject property. i. Toronto Official Plan Referring to Toronto's Official Plan Map 13 Land Use Plan, all four school properties are located within neighbourhood designated areas. The City of Toronto Official Plan describes neighborhoods as a residential area with a wide range of lower scale buildings such as detached houses, semi-detached houses, duplexes, triplexes, and townhouses. There are also apartment buildings that are no higher than 4 storeys. Neighborhoods can also have parks, small scale recreational and cultural facilities, small scale retail, service and office use. You can also find low scale local institutions, such as schools, places of worship, libraries, community centres, day nurseries, nursing homes, etc. When it comes to developing on a or near a neighborhood designated property, it is important to maintain the physical character of the neighborhood. New development must respect, preserve, and establish the current physical patterns in the neighbourhood. Any physical changes to the neighborhood must be sensitive, gradual, and fit the current physical fabric and character of the area. It must be noted that no changes will be made through rezoning, minor variance, consent or other public action that do not match the general character of the neighbourhood. The zoning bylaw will contain numerical standards and regulations that will ensure that new development will be compatible with the physical character of a neighbourhood. ii. Zoning by-law

For all four properties, they have all been zoned under the Former City of North York By-law No. 7625 (OMB, 1953). According the zoning code map, the schools are zoned as Multiple Family Dwelling Third Density Zone or RM3. Under this zoning they permit semi-detached, duplex, converted, double duplex, and apartment houses. The height of any residential use must not go beyond 3 storeys. This designation also permits uses listed under R1, R2, and R3 zones. These

58

uses include recreational uses such as parks, playgrounds, golf courses and includes institutional uses such as schools, Sunday schools, or libraries. The maximum height permitted for any use built on these school properties is 3 storeys. iii. Surrounding Zoning

It is also important to note that while the school properties are zoned by the former by-law, the surrounding properties are zoned by the City of Toronto Zoning By-law 569-2013. All 4 of the schools are mostly surround by residential neighbourhoods, ranging from single-detach, townhouses, and apartment buildings. In addition, there is a substantial amount of parkland surrounding these areas. To further understand the surrounding environment, this part of the assessment will be exploring the various zoning designations that currently surround all four school properties. Listed below are the main zoning uses that surround the four schools along with a brief description of the permitted uses for each zoning: a. Residential Detached Zone- RD In a Residential Detached Zone or RD zone, it permits dwelling units and parks. It also permits other uses but under certain conditions. Some of these conditional uses include a day nursery, community centre, group home, or library. The maximum permitted height is 10 metres (3 storeys). b. Residential Multiple Dwelling Zone - RM In a Residential Multiple Dwelling Zone or RM zone, the permitted uses are the same as an RD zone, however the permitted height is 12 metres (3 to 4 storeys). c. Residential Townhouse Zone ­ RT In a Residential Townhouse Zone or RT zone, the permitted uses are the same as an RD and RM zones, however the permitted height is 24 metres (7 storeys). d. Residential Apartment Commercial ­ RAC In a Residential Apartment Commercial Zone or RAC zone, the permitted uses are the same as an RD, RM, and RT zones, however the permitted height is 10 metres (3 storeys).

59

e. Open Space ­ Recreation Zone - OR In an Open Space- Recreational Zone, it permits uses such as art galleries, community centres, day nurseries, parks, and libraries. The maximum permitted height on an OR zone is 15 metres (4 to 5 storeys). f. Open Space ­ Natural Zone ­ ON In an Open Space- Natural Zone, it permits uses such as agricultural use, parks, police station, public utility, and transportation use. The maximum permitted height on an ON zone is 15 metres (4 to 5 storeys).

Discussion

Based on this preliminary overview of the area surrounding Blacksmith Public School, Shoreham Public Sport and Wellness Academy, Gosford Public School and Firgrove Public School, the following conclusions and recommendations have been complied: In terms of available services and amenities, the four schools or residents of Area A have access to many public services including recreational/community centres, schools, parks, and child care centres. However, the community scan did raise some red flags and concerns in regards to certain services. As mentioned in section 5.3, majority of academic and immigration services were clustered closer to the Firgrove Public School property. Considering that 63% of the area's population are identified as immigrants and 46% of residents speak a non-official language (i.e. not English) as their mother language, there is a need for academic, ESL, and/or immigration services closer to the other three school properties. The area is also in need of more libraries. As mentioned in section 5.3, there is only one library servicing the area, and it is within 1.4 km of Firgrove, 1.6 km of Gosford, 1.7 km of Shoreham, and 2.5 km of Blacksmith. And while three of the schools are within reasonable distance, having another library closer to Blacksmith and Shoreham would service the area well. In terms of development, there are several points that need to be taken into consideration. While the zoning designation for these school properties allow for residential uses, the designated height and density make it harder to build a high density residential project like an apartment building

that goes higher than 3 storeys. And while small scale housing can be provided such as townhouses or single detached that will complement the current uses in the surrounding area (e.g. single-detach homes, townhouses, apartment buildings), it may not be the highest and best use for the area. As a result, it is recommended that any future development to occur onto these properties should be developed into a community hub that focuses on providing social, cultural, and employment services for the area. As mentioned in section 5.3, 30% of the area's population fall within the $20,000 to $40,000 income bracket, and the area has an employment rate of 48%. Hence, with the potential of redeveloping these properties, there is an opportunity to bring in employment opportunities for the area. This can be done by dedicating space on the properties for commercial use, such as convenient stores, medical clinics, and coffee shops. In addition, considering that the highest percentage of the area's population works in the sale and servicing sector, these commercial uses will be in demand by the area's residents. To conclude this assessment, after considering all the area's demographic data, available services and amenities, and land and zoning uses, one can make an informed decision upon choosing the best consolidation options, which were presented in section 5.2 of this chapter. Considering that the Shoreham Public Sport and Wellness Academy and the Firgrove Public School property are surrounded by RAC zones (i.e. Residential Apartment Commercial zones) there is a high possibility for the school board to rebuild bigger school buildings that will accommodate students from different schools. In addition, the other two school properties, Blacksmith and Firgrove Public schools are the two properties that are the farthest from existing services and amenities. Hence, there is an opportunity to build a community hub (as described in the paragraph above iii. Development Opportunities) that will complement the existing character and the needs of the surrounding neighbourhoods, and that can remain within the zoning regulations in terms of permitted uses, height, and density. Hence, it is recommended that Blacksmith Public School is consolidated with Shoreham Public Sport and Wellness Academy onto the Shoreham school property and that Firgrove Public School is consolidated with Gosford Public School onto the Gosford school property. In addition,

consolidating all four of the schools (i.e. two on each property) will allow for the elimination of approximately $31 million in renewal backlog and replacing four old, deteriorating schools with newer facilities.

6. Chapter 6: Limitations 6.1. Baragar Systems School Catchment Areas

Baragar does not account for all the schools within the TDSB district. It excludes alternative schools, schools with specific or special programming, adult schools, and so on. These types of schools are not included into Baragar because they do not have a catchment boundary. Students from all over the City can apply and attend these schools, once they are accepted. It also does not include administrative buildings or schools that have closed down.

6.2.

Community Hubs and Schools

While this research encourages a collaboration between the TDSB, the City, the public, and/or the private sector, it is important to note that the TDSB is not responsible of running or managing anything but TDSB schools. Any other uses on the property will need to be managed by the City and/or the responsible organization. In addition, it must be made clear that community hubs cannot be implemented or imposed by the TDSB onto the proponent. This will need to be the City's responsibility to negotiate with the proponent, as community services and facilities are implemented and managed by the City. Hence, while the TDSB can provide insight and a preliminary analysis of how to develop the school property to its highest and best use, once the property is sold and is no longer under the TDSB jurisdiction, it has no control over what is done on the property after that point.

7. Chapter 7: Conclusion
This research paper explores and analyzes one of the major issues faced by the TDSB and that is the deteriorating conditions of its school buildings. The TDSB's renewal backlog has reached an all-time high of $3.4 billion and has 103 schools (18% of school inventory) that operate at a 65% or lower utilization rate (TDSB, 2014). In addition, TDSB school buildings are aging, with approximately 80 school older than 90 years and 7 schools older than 100 years. To address this issue, under-utilized and deteriorating properties have been declared surplus by the TDSB in order to be sold or leased to other school boards, non-profit organizations, or private investors/developers (Mangione & Suen, 2015). However, the selling of properties with high social and economic value can be a great loss for the school board and for the public, and may not be a sustainable approach for the long run (Brown & Rushowy, 2015). To further understand these issues from a planning perspective, the research dives into the urban planning phenomenon known as Shrinking Cities. According to Hollander (2011), shrinking cities refers to urban areas that are experiencing a decline in their population (Hollander, 2011). One of the main impacts associated with shrinking cities is the under-utilization or even the vacancy of public buildings and properties, a similar dilemma that the TDSB currently faces. However, Hollander (2011) explains that the role planning should play in a situation like this is to adapt to these new changes and to adjust its strategies and policies in order to accommodate a smaller population. Similarly, the TDSB is in need of a new strategy that will efficiently address these issues and allow the TDSB to adapt to these new changes. Hence, this research recommends and proposes a new tool/assessment that will efficiently repurpose and redevelop surplus school lands into community needed infrastructure, services, and/or amenities and replace old and deteriorating TDBS schools with newer school facilities. The assessment consists of the 5 steps/phases. The pre-assessment phase includes establishing an advisory committee that will overlook this assessment and includes identifying potential partnerships, non-profit and/or private, that the TDSB can establish before the site development.

Phase 1: Identifying School Building Conditions This phase will identify schools that are considered to be in critical condition. The factors that will be considered to identify schools in critical conditions are the FCI, building age, utilization rate, and renewal backlog. The purpose of this phase is to establish a priority list of schools that should be catered to right away. Phase 2: School Consolidation Once a list of schools in "critical condition" have been complied, this phase looks at surrounding school catchments and for the opportunity to consolidate with other schools. The selection of a suitable property for the purpose of combining/consolidating multiple schools will be based on factors such as location, land acreage, and walking distance to and from that location. In addition, in this phase, we will also identify if the school property is designated as a heritage building. Phase 3: Social Scan In phase 3 of the assessment, demographic area for the communities and neighbourhoods surrounding the school will be reviewed and analyzed. Data collected for this phase will include age, population, household structure, immigration, language, income status, employment, and tenure type. This phase will provide the advisory committee a clear idea of who lives in the area and what their social and economic needs may be Phase 4: Community Scan The community scan will analyse the available community/public services available and missing in the surrounding area. This phase will also analyse the role the school site in the area played for the community by identifying what services the school provided to the community. This phase will ask questions such as: Does the school run extra-curricular activities after school hours? Do community groups use the school building after school hours? What existing services and amenities does the area have within walking distance? Examples include (but not limited to) Community Centres, libraries, Public and Green space and Grocery stores.

65

Phase 5: Development Scan In this stage of the assessment, a full planning due diligence review of the school property will take place. The development scan will identify zoning by-laws that dictate the permitted uses on the land, maximum/minimum density, size and height of the building, building setbacks, required parking spaces, just to name a few (Taylor, 2014). To further test this proposed tool, the paper applies this assessment to 4 TDSB school properties that have been identified to being in "critical condition" in phase 1. While the assessment in this paper was conducted at a high level, it was able to provide insight on alternative ways these school properties can be repurposed and enhanced in terms of use.

Alternative school: A school that is unique in pedagogy, form of governance, and staff involvement; has strong parental and/or student involvement; and provides an educational experience suited to individual learning styles/preferences and/or needs. Annual Planning Document: A detailed list of program and accommodation studies that will be done during the next year. It reflects the short term work in the form of Local Feasibility Studies that will be done to execute the Long-Term Program and Accommodation Strategy. Attendance boundary: The geographical limits that define the area served by a school or a program. Attendance Boundary Change Study: A study of attendance boundaries between two schools may be undertaken to reduce over-crowding, to utilize surplus space, or to designate addresses to a closer school.

Page 2 of 17

Policy P068 Accommodation and Program Review Intensive Support Program: A special education program for students with one or more exceptionalities, in which students are enrolled for more than half of the instructional program on a school day. Local Feasibility Study: A preliminary analysis of an accommodation or program concept to determine its viability that is conducted by a staff team and the affected Trustee(s). The team, called the Local Feasibility Team, is led by the local Superintendent(s) of Education. The study could lead to other formal public processes such as Boundary Reviews, Program Area Reviews and Pupil Accommodation Reviews that include community engagement. Long-Term Program and Accommodation Strategy: A roadmap for the future that provides an approach to program and accommodation planning with a ten-year timeframe that allows for responsiveness and flexibility in a changing environment by including an annual cycle of review. Modified Pupil Accommodation Review Process: In certain circumstances, where potential pupil accommodation options are deemed by the Board to be less complex, Trustees may decide to undertake a modified Pupil Accommodation Review process. Parents: Includes legal guardians. Program Area Review: A process undertaken for consideration of changes to grade configuration of a school (excluding changes to grade configurations of French Immersion or Extended French programs and programs for students with exceptionalities); the establishment of new schools; or new specialized programs. Pupil Accommodation Review: A process that involves studying a school that is significantly under-utilized and its adjacent schools. The review will consider ways to reduce surplus space and build viable programs. The review may result in the movement of a large number of students between schools. A school closure is a possible outcome. School: A body of elementary or secondary students that is organized as a unit for educational purposes by the TDSB, and includes the teachers and other staff members associated with the unit and the lands and premises used in connection with the unit. Specialized program: A program with a particular curricular focus that has unique admission criteria and specific program requirements. The attendance boundary of specialized programs is the city so that students throughout the city may apply for admission. "Specialized programs" do not include French Immersion or Extended French programs or programs for students with exceptionalities. [Note: a policy to formally define a specialized program (codifying current practice) will be developed and cross-referenced here.]

The Board will make effective and efficient use of facilities to maximize the effectiveness of programs and to ensure that resources are available for programs and supports for students. Whenever the Board considers changes in the location or configuration of programs and schools, staff shall ensure that those who could be most affected have an opportunity to comment on proposed changes. (a) The opportunity to comment on proposed changes shall be provided to students, parents, staff, and members of the community who could be most affected by changes under consideration. Public notice shall be provided in advance of decisions to the extent that is necessary and practicable using a variety of means. It is recognized that the requirements of staffing allocation and other operational requirements may make it difficult to provide a significant period of notice, or make it impracticable in some instances to provide an opportunity for comment in advance of decisions.

Policy P068 Accommodation and Program Review

PREAMBLE
School boards are responsible for managing their school capital assets in an effective manner. They must respond to changing demographics and program needs while ensuring continued student achievement and well-being, and the financial viability/sustainability of the school board. One aspect of a school board's capital and accommodation planning is reviewing schools that have underutilized space. These are schools where the student capacity of the school is greater than the number of students enrolled. When a school board identifies a school that is projected to have long-term excess space, a school board would typically look at a number of options such as:

· · · ·

moving attendance boundaries and programs to balance enrolment between over and underutilized schools; offering to lease underutilized space within a school to a coterminous school board; finding community partners who can pay the full cost of operating the underutilized space; and/or decommissioning or demolishing a section of the school that is not required for student use to reduce operating costs.

If none of these options are deemed viable by a school board, the board may determine that a pupil accommodation review process take place which could lead to possible school consolidations and closures. These decisions are made within the context of supporting the school board's student achievement and well- being strategy and to make the most effective use of its school buildings and funding. The Ministry of Education expects school boards to work with their community partners when undertaking capital planning, including when a school board is beginning to develop options to address underutilized space in schools. The Ministry of Education's Community Planning and Partnerships Guideline (CPPG) outlines requirements for school boards to reach out to their local municipalities and other community partners to share planning related information and to explore potential partnership opportunities. This version of the Pupil Accommodation Review Guideline (the "Guideline") builds upon the CPPG by providing requirements for school boards to share information with and seek feedback from their local municipalities and other community partners related to any pupil accommodation reviews a school board initiates. If a pupil accommodation review results in a school closure decision, a school board will then need to decide whether to declare that school as surplus, potentially leading to the future sale of the property. These sales are governed by provincial regulation. Alternately, a school board may decide to use a closed school for other school board purposes, or hold the property as a strategic long- term asset of the school board due to a projected need for the facility in the

Policy P068 Accommodation and Program Review
future. Each school board decides when it is appropriate to review its strategic property holdings to determine if these properties are still required to be held or should be considered surplus to the school board's needs and considered for a future sale. This document provides direction to school boards on one component of their capital planning - the pupil accommodation review process. It provides the minimum standards the province requires school boards to follow when undertaking a pupil accommodation review. It is important to note that school boards have flexibility to modify their pupil accommodation review policies to meet their local needs, and can develop policies that exceed the provincial minimum standards outlined in this document.

I. PURPOSE
The purpose of the Guideline is to provide a framework of minimum standards for school boards to undertake pupil accommodation reviews to determine the future of a school or group of schools. This Guideline ensures that where a decision is taken by a school board regarding the future of a school, that decision is made with the involvement of an informed local community and is based on a broad range of criteria regarding the quality of the learning experience for students.

This Guideline is effective upon release and replaces the previous Guideline of June 2009.

II. INTRODUCTION
Ontario's school boards are responsible for deciding the most appropriate pupil accommodation arrangements for the delivery of their elementary and secondary programs. These decisions are made by school board trustees in the context of carrying out their primary responsibilities of fostering student achievement and well-being, and ensuring effective stewardship of school board resources. In some cases, to address changing student populations, this requires school boards to consider undertaking pupil accommodation reviews that may lead to school consolidations and closures. Under paragraph 26, subsection 8 (1) of the Education Act, the Minister of Education may issue guidelines with respect to school boards' school closure policies.

III. GUIDING PRINCIPLES
The Guideline has been established to align with the Ministry of Education's vision and as such, focuses on student well-being; academic achievement; and school board financial viability/sustainability.

Board Policy P068, Accommodation and Program Review G02(R:\Secretariat\Staff\G02\03\Pol\P068.doc)sec.1530

Page 4 of 18

Policy P068 Accommodation and Program Review
All school board pupil accommodation review policies should be designed to align with these guiding principles.

IV. SCHOOL BOARD ACCOMMODATION REVIEW POLICIES
School boards are responsible for creating and implementing a policy to address pupil accommodation reviews to serve their local needs. The Ministry of Education expects school boards to consult with local communities prior to adopting or subsequently amending their pupil accommodation review policies. All pupil accommodation review policies must be clear in stipulating that the final decision regarding the future of a school or group of schools rests solely with the Board of Trustees. If the Board of Trustees votes to close a school or schools in accordance with their policy, the school board must provide clear timelines regarding the closure(s) and ensure that a transition plan is communicated to all affected school communities within the school board. It is important to note that this Guideline is intended as a minimum requirement for school boards in developing their policies. School boards are responsible for establishing and complying with their pupil accommodation review policies to serve their local needs. A copy of the school board's pupil accommodation review policy, the government's Pupil Accommodation Review Guideline and the Administrative Review of Accommodation Review Process documents are to be made available to the public as determined in the school board's policy, and posted on the school board's website. The Guideline recognizes that pupil accommodation reviews include a school or group of schools to facilitate the development of viable solutions for pupil accommodation that support the guiding principles. School board pupil accommodation review policies will include statements that encourage the sharing of relevant information as well as providing the opportunity for the public and affected school communities to be heard. The Ministry of Education recommends that, wherever possible, schools should only be subject to a pupil accommodation review once in a five-year period, unless there are circumstances determined by the school board, such as a significant change in enrolment.

V. SCHOOL BOARD PLANNING PRIOR TO AN ACCOMMODATION REVIEW
As described in the Community Planning and Partnerships Guideline, school boards must undertake long-term capital and accommodation planning, informed by any relevant information obtained from local municipal governments and other community partners, which takes into consideration long-term enrolment projections and planning opportunities for the effective use of excess space in all area schools.

Board Policy P068, Accommodation and Program Review G02(R:\Secretariat\Staff\G02\03\Pol\P068.doc)sec.1530

Page 5 of 18

Policy P068 Accommodation and Program Review
School boards must document their efforts to obtain information from local municipal governments as well as other community partners that expressed an interest prior to the pupil accommodation review; and provide any relevant information from municipalities and other community partners as part of the initial staff report (see Section VI).

VI. ESTABLISHING AN ACCOMMODATION REVIEW
School boards may proceed to establish a pupil accommodation review only after undertaking the necessary assessment of long-term capital and accommodation planning options for the school(s).

Initial Staff Report
Prior to establishing a pupil accommodation review, the initial staff report to the Board of Trustees must contain one or more options to address the accommodation issue(s). Each option must have a supporting rationale. There must be a recommended option if more than one option is presented. The initial staff report must also include information on actions taken by school board staff prior to establishing a pupil accommodation review process and supporting rationale as to any actions taken or not taken. The option(s) included in the initial staff report must address the following:

· · · · · · ·

summary of accommodation issue(s) for the school(s) under review; where students would be accommodated; if proposed changes to existing facility or facilities are required as a result of the pupil accommodation review; identify any program changes as a result of the proposed option; how student transportation would be affected if changes take place; if new capital investment is required as a result of the pupil accommodation review, how the school board intends to fund this, as well as a proposal on how students would be accommodated if funding does not become available; and any relevant information obtained from municipalities and other community partners prior to the commencement of the pupil accommodation review, including any confirmed interest in using the underutilized space.

Each recommended option must also include a timeline for implementation. The initial staff report and School Information Profiles (SIPs) (see Section VIII) will be made available to the public, as determined in the school board's policy,

Board Policy P068, Accommodation and Program Review G02(R:\Secretariat\Staff\G02\03\Pol\P068.doc)sec.1530

Policy P068 Accommodation and Program Review
and posted on the school board's website following the decision to proceed with a pupil accommodation review by the Board of Trustees. School boards must ensure that individuals from the school(s) under review and the broader community are invited to participate in the pupil accommodation review consultation. At a minimum, the pupil accommodation review process must consist of the following methods of consultation:

· · · ·

Accommodation Review Committee (ARC) (see Section VII); consultation with municipal governments local to the affected school(s) (see Section IX); public meetings (see Section X); and public delegations (see Section XI).

VII. THE ACCOMMODATION REVIEW COMMITTEE
Role
School boards must establish an ARC that represents the school(s) under review and acts as the official conduit for information shared between the school board and the school communities. The ARC may comment on the initial staff report and may, throughout the pupil accommodation review process, seek clarification of the initial staff report. The ARC may provide other accommodation options than those in the initial staff report; however, it must include supporting rationale for any such option. The ARC members do not need to achieve consensus regarding the information provided to the Board of Trustees. The school board's staff resources assigned to the ARC are required to compile feedback from the ARC as well as the broader community in the Community Consultation section of the final staff report (see Section XI) to be presented to the Board of Trustees.

Membership
The membership of the ARC should include, at a minimum, parent/guardian representatives from each of the schools under review, chosen by their respective school communities. Where established by a school board's pupil accommodation review policy, there may also be the option to include students and representation from the broader community. For example, a school board's policy may include a requirement for specific representation from the First Nations, Metis, and Inuit communities. In addition, school board trustees may be ad hoc ARC members to monitor the ARC progress.

Board Policy P068, Accommodation and Program Review G02(R:\Secretariat\Staff\G02\03\Pol\P068.doc)sec.1530

Page 7 of 18

Policy P068 Accommodation and Program Review Formation
The ARC should be formed following the Board of Trustees' consideration of the initial staff report but prior to the first public meeting. The school board will invite ARC members from the school(s) under review to an orientation session that will describe the mandate, roles and responsibilities, and procedures of the ARC.

Terms of Reference
School boards will provide the ARC with Terms of Reference that describe the ARC's mandate. The mandate will refer to the school board's education and accommodation objectives in undertaking the ARC and reflect the school board's strategy for supporting student achievement and well-being. The Terms of Reference will also clearly outline the school board's expectations of the roles and responsibilities of the ARC; and describe the procedures of the ARC. At a minimum, the ARC will provide feedback on the initial staff report option(s). The Terms of Reference will outline the minimum number of working meetings of the ARC.

Meetings of the Accommodation Review Committee
The ARC will meet to review materials presented by school board staff. It is recommended that the ARC hold as many working meetings as is deemed necessary within the timelines established in their school board's pupil accommodation review policy.

VIII. SCHOOL INFORMATION PROFILE
School board staff are required to develop School Information Profiles (SIPs) as orientation documents to help the ARC and the community understand the context surrounding the decision to include the specific school(s) in a pupil accommodation review. The SIP provides an understanding of and familiarity with the facilities under review. The SIP is expected to include data for each of the following two considerations about the school(s) under review:

· ·

value to the student; and value to the school board.

A SIP will be completed by school board staff for each of the schools under review. The following are the minimum data requirements and factors that are to be included in the SIP:

School boards may introduce additional items that could be used to reflect local circumstances and priorities which may help to further understand the school(s) under review. Each school under review will have a SIP completed at the same point-in-time for comparison purposes. The Ministry of Education expects school boards to prepare SIPs that are complete and accurate, to the best of the school board's ability, prior to the commencement of a pupil accommodation review. While the ARC may request clarification about information provided in the SIP, it is not the role of the ARC to approve the SIP.

IX. CONSULTATION WITH LOCAL MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS
Following the Board of Trustees' approval to undertake a pupil accommodation review, school boards must invite affected single and upper-tier municipalities as well as other community partners that expressed an interest prior to the pupil accommodation review to discuss and comment on the recommended option(s) in the school board's initial staff report. The invitation for this meeting will be provided through a written notice, and will be directed through the Clerks Department (or equivalent) for the affected single and uppertier municipalities. The affected single and upper-tier municipalities, as well as other community partners that expressed an interest prior to the pupil accommodation review, must provide their response on the recommended option(s) in the school board's initial staff report before the final public meeting. School boards must provide them with advance notice of when the final public meeting is scheduled to take place. School boards must document their efforts to meet with the affected single and upper-tier municipalities, as well as other community partners that expressed an interest prior to the

Board Policy P068, Accommodation and Program Review G02(R:\Secretariat\Staff\G02\03\Pol\P068.doc)sec.1530

Page 10 of 18

Policy P068 Accommodation and Program Review
pupil accommodation review; and provide any relevant information from this meeting as part of the final staff report to the Board of Trustees (see Section XI).

X. PUBLIC MEETINGS
Once a school board has received an initial staff report and has approved the initiation of a pupil accommodation review, the school board must arrange to hold a minimum of two public meetings for broader community consultation on the initial staff report. School board staff are expected to facilitate the public meetings to solicit broader community feedback on the recommended option(s) contained in the initial staff report. The public meetings are to be announced and advertised publicly by the school board through an appropriate range of media as determined by the school board. At a minimum, the first public meeting must include the following:

· · ·

an overview of the ARC orientation session; the initial staff report with recommended option(s); and a presentation of the SIPs.

XI. COMPLETING THE ACCOMMODATION REVIEW
Final Staff Report
At the conclusion of the pupil accommodation review process, school board staff will submit a final staff report to the Board of Trustees which must be available to the public as determined in the school board's policy, and posted on the school board's website. The final staff report must include a Community Consultation section that contains feedback from the ARC and any public consultations as well as any relevant information obtained from municipalities and other community partners prior to and during the pupil accommodation review. School board staff may choose to amend their proposed option(s) included in the initial staff report. The recommended option(s) must also include a proposed accommodation plan, prepared for the decision of the Board of Trustees, which contains a timeline for implementation.

Board Policy P068, Accommodation and Program Review G02(R:\Secretariat\Staff\G02\03\Pol\P068.doc)sec.1530

Page 11 of 18

Policy P068 Accommodation and Program Review

Delegations to the Board of Trustees Meeting
Once school board staff submits the final staff report to the Board of Trustees, the school board must allow an opportunity for members of the public to provide feedback on the final staff report through public delegations to the Board of Trustees. Notice of the public delegation opportunities will be provided based on school board policy. After the public delegations, school board staff will compile feedback from the public delegations which will be presented to the Board of Trustees with the final staff report.

Decision of the Board of Trustees
The Board of Trustees will be provided with the final staff report, including the compiled feedback from the public delegations, when making its final decision regarding the pupil accommodation review. The Board of Trustees has the discretion to approve the recommendation(s) of the final staff report as presented, modify the recommendation(s) of the final staff report, or to approve a different outcome. The Ministry encourages school boards not to make final pupil accommodation review decisions during the summer holiday period (typically from July 1 to the day after Labour Day).

XII. TRANSITION PLANNING
The transition of students should be carried out in consultation with parents/guardians and staff. Following the decision to consolidate and/or close a school, the school board is expected to establish a separate committee to address the transition for students and staff.

XIII. TIMELINES FOR THE ACCOMMODATION REVIEW PROCESS
The pupil accommodation review process must comply with the following minimum timelines:

·

Following the date of the Board of Trustees' approval to conduct a pupil accommodation review, the school board will provide written notice of the Board of Trustees' decision within 5 business days to each of the affected single and upper-tier municipalities through the Clerks Department (or equivalent), other community partners that expressed an interest prior to the pupil accommodation review; and include an invitation for a meeting to discuss and comment on the recommended option(s) in the school board's initial staff report. School boards must also notify the Director(s)

Policy P068 Accommodation and Program Review
of Education of their coterminous school boards and the Ministry of Education through the office of the Assistant Deputy Minister of the Financial Policy and Business Division.

·

The affected single and upper-tier municipalities, as well as other community partners that expressed an interest prior to the pupil accommodation review, must provide their response on the recommended option(s) in the school board's initial staff report before the final public meeting. Beginning with the date of the Board of Trustees' approval to conduct a pupil accommodation review, there must be no fewer than 30 business days before the first public meeting is held. There must be a minimum period of 40 business days between the first and final public meetings. The final staff report must be publicly posted no fewer than 10 business days after the final public meeting. From the posting of the final staff report, there must be no fewer than 10 business days before the public delegations. There must be no fewer than 10 business days between public delegations and the final decision of the Board of Trustees.

XIV. MODIFIED ACCOMMODATION REVIEW PROCESS
In certain circumstances, where the potential pupil accommodation options available are deemed by the school board to be less complex, school boards may find it appropriate to undertake a modified pupil accommodation review process. The Guideline permits a school board to include an optional modified pupil accommodation review process in its pupil accommodation review policy. A school board's pupil accommodation review policy must clearly outline the conditions where a modified pupil accommodation review process could be initiated by explicitly defining the factors that would allow the school board the option to conduct a modified pupil accommodation review process. The conditions for conducting a modified pupil accommodation review process need to be based on two or more of the following factors:

· · ·

distance to the nearest available accommodation; utilization rate of the facility; number of students enrolled at the school; or

· when a school board is planning the relocation (in any school year or over a
number of school years) of a program, in which the enrolment constitutes more than or equal to 50% of the school's enrolment (this calculation is based on the enrolment at the time of the relocation, or the first phase of a relocation carried over a number of school years).

Page 13 of 18

Policy P068 Accommodation and Program Review
School boards may consider additional factors that are defined in their pupil accommodation review policy to qualify for the modified pupil accommodation review process. Multiple factors may be developed by the school board to appropriately reflect varying conditions across the board (e.g., urban, rural, elementary panel, secondary panel, etc.). The Board of Trustees must approve these explicitly defined factors, after community consultation, in order to adopt a modified pupil accommodation review process as part of their school board's pupil accommodation review policy. The guiding principles of this Guideline apply to the modified pupil accommodation review process. Even when the criteria for a modified pupil accommodation review are met, a school board may choose to use the standard pupil accommodation review process.

Implementing the Modified Accommodation Review Process
The initial staff report will explain the rationale for exempting the school(s) from the standard pupil accommodation review process, in accordance with the school board's pupil accommodation review policy. The initial staff report and SIPs must be made available to the public, as determined in the school board's policy, and posted on the school board's website. A public meeting will be announced and advertised through an appropriate range of media as determined by the school board. Following the public meeting, school board staff will submit a final staff report to the Board of Trustees which must be available to the public as determined in the school board's policy, and posted on the school board's website. The final staff report must include a Community Consultation section that contains feedback from any public consultations as well as any relevant information obtained from municipalities and other community partners prior to and during the modified pupil accommodation review. Once school board staff submit the final staff report to the Board of Trustees, the school board must allow an opportunity for members of the public to provide feedback through public delegations to the Board of Trustees. Notice of the public delegation opportunities will be provided based on school board policy. After the public delegations, school board staff will compile feedback from the public delegations which will be presented to the Board of Trustees with the final staff report.

Policy P068 Accommodation and Program Review

The Board of Trustees has the discretion to approve the recommendation(s) of the final staff report as presented, modify the recommendation(s) of the final staff report, or to approve a different outcome. The Ministry encourages school boards not to make final pupil accommodation review decisions during the summer holiday period (typically from July 1 to the day after Labour Day). A transition plan will be put in place following the decision to consolidate and/or close a school.

Timelines for the Modified Accommodation Review Process
The modified pupil accommodation review process must comply with the following minimum timelines:

·

Following the date of the Board of Trustees' approval to conduct a modified pupil accommodation review, the school board will provide written notice of the Board of Trustees' decision within 5 business days to each of the affected single and upper-tier municipalities through the Clerks Department (or equivalent), other community partners that expressed an interest prior to the modified pupil accommodation review; and include an invitation for a meeting to discuss and comment on the recommended option(s) in the school board's initial staff report. School boards must also notify the Director(s) of Education of their coterminous school boards and the Ministry of Education through the office of the Assistant Deputy Minister of the Financial Policy and Business Division. The affected single and upper-tier municipalities, as well as other community partners that expressed an interest prior to the modified pupil accommodation review, must provide their response on the recommended option(s) in the school board's initial staff report before the final public meeting. The school board must hold at least one public meeting. Beginning with the date of the Board of Trustees' approval to conduct a modified pupil accommodation review, there must be no fewer than 30 business days before this public meeting is held. The final staff report must be publicly posted no fewer than 10 business days after the final public meeting. From the posting of the final staff report, there must be no fewer than 10 business days before the public delegations. There must be no fewer than 10 business days between public delegations and the final decision of the Board of Trustees.

XV. EXEMPTIONS
This Guideline applies to schools offering elementary or secondary programs. However, there are specific circumstances where school boards are not obligated to undertake a pupil accommodation review. These include:

·

where a replacement school is to be built by the school board on the existing site, or built or acquired within the existing school attendance boundary, as identified through the school board's policy; where a replacement school is to be built by the school board on the existing site, or built or acquired within the existing school attendance boundary and the school community must be temporarily relocated to ensure the safety of students and staff during the reconstruction, as identified through the school board's policy; when a lease for the school is terminated; when a school board is planning the relocation (in any school year or over a number of school years) of grades or programs, in which the enrolment constitutes less than 50% of the school's enrolment (this calculation is based on the enrolment at the time of the relocation, or the first phase of a relocation carried over a number of school years); when a school board is repairing or renovating a school, and the school community must be temporarily relocated to ensure the safety of students during the renovations; where a facility has been serving as a holding school for a school community whose permanent school is over-capacity and/or is under construction or repair; or where there are no students enrolled at the school at any time throughout the school year.

·

· ·

·

·

·

In the above circumstances, a school board is expected to inform school communities about proposed accommodation plans for students before a decision is made by the Board of Trustees. The school board will also provide written notice to each of the affected single and upper-tier municipalities through the Clerks Department (or equivalent), as well as other community partners that expressed an interest prior to the exemption, and their coterminous school boards in the areas of the affected school(s) through the Director of Education, and to the Ministry of Education through the Assistant Deputy Minister of the Financial Policy and Business Division no fewer than 5 business days after the decision to proceed with an exemption.

XVI. DEFINITIONS
Accommodation review: A process, as defined in a school board pupil accommodation review policy, undertaken by a school board to determine the future of a school or group of schools. Accommodation Review Committee (ARC): A committee, established by a school board that represents the affected school(s) of a pupil accommodation review, which acts as the official conduit for information shared between the school board and the affected school communities. ARC working meeting: A meeting of ARC members to discuss a pupil accommodation review, and includes a meeting held by the ARC to solicit feedback from the affected school communities of a pupil accommodation review. Business day: A calendar day that is not a weekend or statutory holiday. It also does not include calendar days that fall within school boards' Christmas, spring, and summer break. For schools with a year-round calendar, any break that is five calendar days or longer is not a business day. Consultation: The sharing of relevant information as well as providing the opportunity for municipalities and other community partners, the public and affected school communities to be heard. Facility Condition Index (FCI): A building condition as determined by the Ministry of Education by calculating the ratio between the five-year renewal needs and the replacement value for each facility. On-the-ground (OTG) capacity: The capacity of the school as determined by the Ministry of Education by loading all instructional spaces within the facility to current Ministry standards for class size requirements and room areas. Public delegation: A regular meeting of the Board of Trustees where presentations by groups or individuals can have their concerns heard directly by the school board trustees. Public meeting: An open meeting held by the school board to solicit broader community feedback on a pupil accommodation review. School Information Profile (SIP): An orientation document with point-in-time data for each of the schools under a pupil accommodation review to help the ARC and the community understand the context surrounding the decision to include the specific school(s) in a pupil accommodation review.

Why a Survey Now?
The Toronto Employment Survey collects annual employment data from business establishments across the city. This information is used to measure the city's economic and employment structure and monitor the progress of Official Plan policies. The continued collection of survey information enables the city to monitor long range economic trends citywide and emerging activity in areas designated for employment or business growth, including Downtown, the Centres, Secondary Plan Areas and Employment Areas (see Map 1). The survey results allow more effective long range projection and planning for urban infrastructure and municipal services, and help monitor the city's progress toward its investment and fiscal goals.

What Data Was Collected?
The Toronto Employment Survey collects citywide business information through in-person visits on an annual basis. Between May and August, surveyors record the following information into a citywide dataset of businesses: · primary type of employment activity · full-time and part-time employee counts · length of time business has been at that location In the case of major, multi-branch employers, the information is collected through a questionnaire mailed to the primary contact at the head office. Business and employment activity is classified by both NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) and the Land Use Activity Codes of RISWG (Regional Information Systems Working Group of the Regional Planning Commissioners of Ontario) codes to allow comparisons to other jurisdictions. In 2017, employment data was acquired from 88.8% of identified businesses establishments. In 2016 the response rate was 88.5%.

Survey Geography
The survey conducts in-person business establishment interviews in commercial, industrial, institutional and mixed use areas across the city, including: · Major office and service clusters in the Downtown and Centres · Employment Areas designated for employment use and business growth · Mixed Use Areas in Downtown, the Centres, Secondary Plan areas, along the Avenues and throughout the city · Institutional precincts containing health or education uses · Retail malls and power centres · Community and local retail uses in residential areas including private schools and community uses. Employment activities that are "footloose" or not place-specific on a daily basis are captured at head or reporting offices when the data is available. In 2017, the Survey explored how to better capture home-based and volunteer work through a pilot project (see Special Topics, below).

City Employment Overview
Riding the global growth wave Toronto's 2017 employment growth of 57,550 jobs or 3.9% was the highest since 1999, when employment grew by 5.1%
In 2017, the Toronto Employment Survey recorded 1,518,560 jobs in the City of Toronto, a gain of 57,550 jobs or 3.9% from 2016. This is above Toronto's five-year compound employment growth rate of 2.7%, and the strongest since 1999, when employment grew by 5.1%. According to the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook October 2017, Toronto's employment growth (roughly Q3 2016 through Q2 2017) aligned with strong economic output from both Canada (3.8% nominal) and the U.S. (3.9%) and with a global upswing in economic activity projected to reach 3.6% in 2017 and 3.7% in 2018.2

Services-driven economy
Economic output from serviceproducing industries has continued to outpace that from goods-producing industries. Overall, Canadian servicebased output from Q3 2016 through Q2 2017 grew 3.1%, above the 5-year (2.3%) and 10-year (2.0%) trends. Surprisingly, Canadian goodsproducing during the same period grew 5.9%, significantly above the 5-year (1.8%) and 10-year (1.0%) growth rates.

Business and consumer outlook
The consumer confidence index surveys consumer optimism about current economic conditions, and is an indicator of near-term sales for consumer products companies. The index stood at 100.9 in July 2017, up from 100.0 in 2016 and 99.0 in 2012.3

Broad category gains
The city's remarkable employment growth was also shared by the Manufacturing, Services, Retail and Community and Entertainment categories, significantly outpacing their 5-year trends.

Despite the 2016-2017 trend, the total share of part-time employment in the city has grown on average by 2.4% per annum between 2012 and 2017 (see Table 2, Appendix).

Improved survey coverage
In 2017, improvements were made to the employment reporting process, most notably in the Community and Entertainment category. Also, by working closely with major employers, the Survey was able to more thoroughly count employees with a non-regular or varying place of work.

Key Citywide Trends Figure 4: Total 2017 2017 Total Employment by Category Manufacturing Employment by Category
Despite a long-term secular shift from goods to services production in Toronto's economy, manufacturing employment grew at a remarkable rate, adding 8,260 jobs or 6.7% from 2016. Processed Goods Processing led category job growth, with food and chemical product processing subcategories each adding more than 1,000 jobs. Warehousing employment also added 850 jobs. The city's manufacturing establishments grew at an above-average rate (1.4%), adding 70 businesses. The average number of employees per establishment increased to 27 from 25 in 2016. Potential industry factors contributing to this growth include a competitive tax environment, a lower Canadian dollar, an improving export environment, decreased fuel and transportation costs, and higher capital investment in machinery and equipment.5

Demand for industrial space in Toronto increased, with the industrial vacancy rate falling to 0.6% in Q2 2017 from 1.0% in Q2 2016, well below the 1.7% vacancy rate in the Greater Toronto Area.6

Community and Entertainment Trends
Toronto's smallest employment category, Community and Entertainment, was the city's fastestgrowing in 2017, adding 6,320 jobs to grow by 12.9%. A third of growth came in 2017 from the construction sub-category. The city gained more than 2,300 construction jobs in 2017 as Toronto's real estate cycle continued. More than half of these jobs were located in Downtown. Sports and entertainment venues also added significant growth. BMO Field and the Air Canada Centre added 2,300 net new jobs in 2017. Employment growth at these venues has coincided with the success and increased season length of the city's major league sports teams.

Manufacturing employment grew at a remarkable rate, adding 8,260 jobs or 6.7% from 2016

Retail Trends
Retail employment grew at an aboveaverage rate in 2017, adding 4,750 jobs or 3.2%. Structural trends in the retail sector have resulted in slower annual growth since 2012 (1.2%). Factors potentially influencing this trend include growing consumer use of online channels, increasing automation in retail environments, and concentration of retailing in fewer, larger locations.9 Ongoing trends in expansions and upgrades to retail environments appear to be continuing from 2016, which saw the renovation of major retail centres such as the Eaton Centre and Yorkdale Mall.

Employment by NAICS Economic Sector
Service-based industries make up 77.5% of employment in Toronto's economy
In 2011, the Survey incorporated the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) into its data coding. While the employment categories, through activity codes, profile the land use and occupancy in the city, NAICS offers additional detail about the structure of the economy. As a coding standard across North America, NAICS also allows for more accurate analysis and comparison of Toronto's results with other jurisdictions. In 2017, the Survey was extremely successful in coding Toronto's establishments with 98.4% of businesses assigned a full 6-digit code.

Toronto's Economy
Three major sectors make up the employment shares of Toronto's economy: Service-Based industries (77.5%), Government and Institutional industries (13.9%) and Goods Producing industries (8.6%). Since 2012, annual growth in Government and Institutional (3.9%) and Service-Based jobs (3.0%) have offset employment losses in Goods Production (-0.9%). Total 5-year employment net change was 187,060 jobs added, including Service-Based (156,160 jobs) Government and Institutional (36,940 jobs) and Goods Producing industries (a loss of 6,010 jobs).

Since 2012, additional sectors have experienced high annual growth rates and five-year employment increases: · Real Estate, Rental and Leasing added 10,270 jobs since 2012, averaging 5.4% annual growth Management added 12,010 jobs since 2012, averaging 5.3% annual growth Educational Services added 26,990 jobs since 2012, averaging 5.2% annual growth Administrative and Support, Waste Management and Remediation Services added 15,060 jobs since 2012, averaging 4.5% annual growth Finance and Insurance added 25,920 jobs since 2012, averaging 3.9% annual growth Arts, Entertainment and Recreation added 6,130 jobs since 2012, averaging 3.8% annual growth.

Major Sectors
NAICS classifies the economy into 20 major sectors. In 2017, 49.8% of all jobs in Toronto were in the top five NAICS sectors. Three of these five sectors have increased their shares of total employment since 2012: Finance and Insurance (0.6%), Health Care and Social Assistance (0.6%) and Educational Services (0.9%). In 2017, the top sectors for job growth included Administrative and Support, Waste Management and Remediation Services (adding 8,410 net jobs or 12.4%), Finance and Insurance (adding 7,350 net jobs or 5.1%) and Educational Services (adding 6,610 net jobs or 5.8%).

Together, these areas form the backbone of the city's urban economic structure. They are connected by transit and transportation arteries, maximizing existing infrastructure and services in order to best accommodate growth. The Official Plan also identifies 34 Secondary Plan areas, many of which are experiencing rapid growth through intensification.

both residential and employment growth. Employment Areas are designated primarily for employment-related land uses. The Places to Grow Act is the Provincial legislation that governs planning for growth and development in a way that supports economic prosperity, protects the environment and helps communities achieve a high quality of life in Ontario. The Places to Grow Act also enables the development of regional growth plans that guide government investments and policies, such as the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, 2017 ("Growth Plan"). The Growth Plan reinforces Toronto's Official Plan by enabling the identification of Strategic Growth Areas. These areas

Employment in Secondary Plan Areas
Secondary Plan areas contain 317,130 jobs, 20.9% of city employment
With 20.9% of all employment (317,130 jobs), Secondary Plan areas reflect much of the city's recent urban growth. In 2017, Secondary Plan employment grew by 21,030 jobs or 7.1%, well above the city average growth rate of 3.9%. The Official Plan contains Secondary Plans to manage growth and change in specific parts of the city. Secondary Plan areas contain a range of land use designations and cover diverse geographic areas across Toronto, including parts of Downtown, the Centres, and Employment Areas. As a result, the employment and establishment data in Secondary Plan

areas should be understood in relation to the City as a whole, rather than compared to data for Downtown, the Centres, or Employment Areas. Also, the Secondary Plan areas for the Downtown, North York Centre and Yonge Eglinton Centre differ from the areas of the Centres and Downtown designated in the Official Plan. Employment and establishment data differ from the Downtown and Centres information in these areas.

Secondary Plan Employment
Secondary Plan employment includes 24.1% of all Office employment in the city, as well as 26.3% of all Community and Entertainment employment in the city (see Table 6, Appendix).

Smaller Secondary Plan areas

Top areas by employment
The largest Secondary Plan areas (those with 10,000 or more employees) are generally situated in or near Downtown, the Centres, along the city's rapid transit network, or around major post-secondary institutions. In these areas, Office is the predominant employment category, with four exceptions: Sheppard East Subway Corridor and Lawrence-Allen have mostly Retail employment due to the presence of the Yorkdale and Lawrence Square shopping centres, and both York University and University of Toronto have predominantly Institutional employment. All of these Secondary Plan areas have added jobs over the past year, with the

Smaller Secondary Plan areas (under 10,000 employees) are comprised of smaller geographic areas further from Downtown, but still contain significant concentrations of employment. While many of these areas have a predominant share of Office employment, Service employment is predominant in Motel Strip, Railway Lands West, Queen River, and Port Union Village Community.

Employment Areas
Toronto's Employment Areas contain 27.1% of all jobs and 29.2% of all business establishments
Toronto's Employment Areas are a key part of the city's land use framework and are designated for employment use and growth. These areas are important as regionally and globally competitive locations for national and international business as well as areas for business formation. Employment Areas are generally occupied by manufacturing, warehousing and product assembly activities as well as commercial business parks. They provide a broad range of job opportunities for Toronto residents and the regional labour force, and help ensure a stable environment for investment and to maintain and grow the city's revenue base.

Areas identified in the City's Official Plan at the time of the 2017 Toronto Employment Survey. Overall, 29.2% of all establishments (22,080 locations) and 27.1% of all jobs (411,970 jobs) are located in Toronto's Employment Areas. Employment Areas are particularly important to the Manufacturing sector, with 79.4% of Manufacturing establishments and 92.3% of all Manufacturing jobs located in Toronto's Employment Areas (see Map 4). Employment Areas continue to attract new businesses, with 1,470 or 29.9% of new establishments in the city locating in Employment Areas in 2017.

If the average rate of employment growth continues (2.7% annually over the last five years), Toronto will achieve Growth Plan forecasts by 2022, almost twenty years before the target. Given the pace of Toronto's employment growth relative to the forecast, the Province can be expected to undertake another review of Growth Plan targets. The Growth Plan also provides for an Official Plan designation for Prime Employment Areas, to protect land for consumptive or low density employment uses such as manufacturing, warehousing, goods movement or utilities. Often, industrial and other impactful employment uses have few alternative locations in the city due to the potentially negative impacts of their activities on residential and other sensitive land uses. Conflicts related to

the conversion of employment lands to residential or other sensitive uses can destabilize an entire area, resulting in employment loss and erosion of available areas for business formation or expansion.

These designations came into force by an order of the Ontario Municipal Board on December 20, 2016. Core Employment Areas are for the most part, geographically located within the interior of employment areas. Uses that would attract the general public into the interior of employment lands and possibly disrupt industrial operations are not generally permitted in Core Employment Areas. General Employment Areas are often located on the periphery of Employment Areas, along major roads. This designation provides for retail stores, service shops and restaurants. These areas have increased visibility and transit access to draw the broader public.

Official Plan Amendment 231
On December 18, 2013, Council adopted Amendment 231 of the Official Plan (OPA 231). OPA 231 amends Policy 2.1.2 of the Official Plan by deleting the term Employment Districts and replacing it with Employment Areas. As a result, the Survey began reporting on Employment Areas in 2016 (including data to 2013). See Tables 7 and 8 in the Appendix.

Core and General Employment Areas
Section 4.6 of OPA 231 differentiates Core and General Employment Areas.

Special Topic: HomeBased and Volunteer Pilot
Office establishments in the Downtown pilot area were the most likely to have home-based employment (32.1%). Establishment Basis of Survey
As an establishment-based survey, the Survey collects information annually through field visits to business establishments and asks for information about the number of employees who are working in the business location. As such, it differs from place-of-work information captured by the Statistics Canada Census instrument, which only records an individual's primary occupation, not secondary employment activities.

As a result, the Survey is not designed to capture the full extent of home-based employment, or employment that is "footloose," not place-specific on a daily basis.

Home-based and volunteer employment pilot studies
While a certain share of home-based and footloose employment is captured by the Survey directly through head or district office reporting, research has been undertaken to explore how to expand its coverage to capture additional employment. In 2017, the Survey included two pilot studies to study counts of homebased and volunteer employment. The counts of home-based employees and volunteers were not included in the total employment information for 2017, given the preliminary nature of the pilot study. The pilots were conducted in four geographically distinct areas of the city. These areas included a Downtown area with primarily office-based employment, a suburban part of Scarborough with mostly community and institutional establishments, a predominantly retail area in central Toronto, and a manufacturing area in North York. Occupants were asked whether they had any home-based employees, and if so, the total number; as well as whether there were volunteers, such as interns, and the total number if applicable.

Home-Based Employment Results
A total of 1,070 establishments were surveyed in the four areas of the pilot studies. The overall response rate was 86.0%, with 920 of 1,070 establishments providing responses. About 14% of respondents overall (150 establishments) indicated that they had home-based employment. The highest rate of establishments with home-based employees was in

the Downtown office area, 31.9% of respondents, followed by 7.5% of respondents in the central Toronto retail area, 5.5% of respondents in the Scarborough suburban area and 3.8% of respondents in the North York manufacturing area. Despite these levels of establishments with home-based employees, the overall share of home-based employment relative to place-specific employment was low, at 2.4%, or 560 of 22,840 jobs. Individual areas ranged from a 4.3% equivalent share in the downtown office area to a 0.4% share in the North York manufacturing area. Office establishments were more likely to have home-based employment. Some 21.7% of office establishments in pilot areas had employees working from home compared to 3.1% of Community and Entertainment establishments. In the Downtown pilot area, 32.1% of Office establishments reported home-based employment. These findings suggest the importance of exploring home-based employment geographically, with a focus on Downtown, and by category, with a focus on the Office category.

the relative share of volunteers varied considerably by pilot area. In the suburban Scarborough area, the amount of volunteers relative to the area's total employment was 13.4%, while it was only 2.0% in the central retail area. The overall share of volunteers compared to total employment in the pilot areas was 4.4%. These results indicate that any future study of volunteers in Toronto should focus on Institutional establishments across the city.

Institutional establishments were the most likely in the pilot areas to have volunteers (21.2%)

The lowest proportion was in the central retail area, where volunteers were recorded at only 3.5% of establishments. About 21.2% of Institutional establishments reported having volunteers.

2016 Establishment Count Comparison
It is estimated that the Survey reported on 99.3% of business establishments outside of residential areas in 2016
To understand how to improve Survey coverage, the 2016 Toronto Employment Survey establishment locations were compared with Statistics Canada's Business Patterns and Environics Analytics' Business Locations data. Both datasets counted higher levels of business locations. The Business Register data set counted 18.7% more establishments than the Survey, while the Business Locations counted 11.1% more establishments than the Survey.

To explore this further, location mapping was undertaken to determine the geospatial distribution of Business Locations data. It can be seen that many establishments are located in residential areas (Neighbourhoods or Apartment Neighbourhoods as designated in Toronto's Official Plan), while most establishments the Survey tended are along main streets and in designated growth areas (Downtown, the Centres, and Employment Areas). These findings suggest that many additional establishments not captured in the Survey are home-based.

Map 5: 2016 Employment Concentration

Bathurst and Lawrence Case Study
A case study was undertaken to examine Business Locations data in the Bathurst and Lawrence area to better understand establishments located in residential areas typically not captured by the Survey. It was found that within residential structures, no signage or any other markers of employment activity were visible. As a result, these types of establishments would not normally be identified by field surveyors who survey visible places of work in commercial, industrial and institutional and mixed use areas.

Adjusting Business Locations establishment counts to remove those in residential areas, the results converged with the Survey, with the difference in total establishment counts dropping to 0.7% or 510 business locations (compared to 11.1% or 9,340 locations before adjustments). These results indicate the Survey reported on 99.3% of business establishments outside of residential areas in 2016. Current survey practices are highly successful in capturing traditional business establishments but have limited success at capturing non-traditional and home-based employment.

Census 2016 Comparison
Between 2006 and 2016, Toronto's part-time employment increased at an annual rate of 3.0%, double the growth rate of total employment
In 2017, Statistics Canada released the results of the 2016 Census. The Census Place Of Work data provide an opportunity to better understand the Survey results, by comparing reported usual Place Of Work data with the 2016 location-based employment counts from the Survey. The 2016 long-form Census counted 1,443,680 employed people by reported place of work in Toronto. This count represents those reporting their usual place of work in Toronto This includes those who reside in Toronto and work from home. In comparison, the 2016 Toronto Employment Survey counted 1,461,020 jobs, slightly more overall employment than the Census (approximately 1%).

by the observed presence of homebased employment. The 2016 Census results indicate an emerging trend toward higher employment counts in the Survey. This may be due to the increasing share of part-time employment in Toronto. Since the Census counts an individual's primary employment, it does not capture secondary employment or additional jobs held by that person. The Survey, by capturing both full-time and part-time employment by location, more completely captures the full spectrum of work within the city.

The Trend Toward Part-Time Work
The increase in part-time work in Toronto is evident over the past decade. Between 2006 and 2016, part-time employment increased by 34.7% (96,140 jobs), an average annual growth rate of 3.0%, double the annual growth rate for total employment (1.3%). In 2016, 25.5% of jobs in the city were part-time, up from 21.7% in 2006 (see Table 1).

Counting Part-Time Employment
Historically, the Survey has counted fewer jobs than the Census. This undercount can be partly explained

Sector Analysis
Breaking out total employment by NAICS helps to better understand sectoral differences between the Census and the Survey. Since 2012, the Survey counts by NAICS has converged with the Census. This trend can be partly explained by improvements to the Survey's data collection and verification processes, but also by the improved response rates and accuracy of the 2016 long-form Census compared to the 2011 National Household Survey (NHS). Most NAICS sector counts from the Survey are within a 10% margin of error compared to the 2016 Census. These include: Manufacturing, Wholesale Trade, Retail Trade, Transportation and Warehousing, Real Estate, Educational Services, and Arts and Entertainment.

Improving sector counts from Survey include: Construction, Information and Cultural Industries, and Public Administration, due to continued coding improvements.

Sector Differences
Observed discrepancies have continued in the Management of Companies and Enterprises sector. While the Survey and the 2016 Census (and 2011 NHS) both utilize NAICS coding for Management of Companies and Enterprises, Statistics Canada employs a narrower definition for this sector, including only "holdings and other investment companies". The Survey utilizes a broader definition that includes establishments that have been identified as Head Offices, resulting in higher employment counts for this sector. These higher counts in Management from the Survey may explain the lower figures for other sectors such as Finance and Insurance, Mining, Agriculture, and Professional, Scientific and Technical Services, may have been coded as Management under NAICS.
