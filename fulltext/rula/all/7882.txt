algebra, which we present from [4] without proof. The proof can be found in texts such as [4]. Theorem 1 (Fundamental Theorem of Algebra). The field of complex numbers is algebraically closed; that is, every polynomial in C[x] has a zero in C. Thus, for any zero xi  C of a polynomial p(x), we can factor as p(x) = (x - xi )q (x) with q (x)  C[x]. The consequence of the fundamental theorem of algebra on the number of roots of a polynomial equation of degree n is presented in the following theorem Theorem 2. If p(x)  F [x] be a polynomial of degree n in the field F , which is a subfield of C, then p(x) has exactly n zeros in C. Proof. If we take a polynomial p(x) of degree n, by the fundamental theorem of algebra, we must have a linear factor x1  C so that p(x) = (x - x1 )q (x) with p(x1 ) = 0. But q (x), which is of degree n - 1 must also have a linear factor by the fundamental theorem of algebra. Thus, q (x) = (x - x2 )r(x) with q (x2 ) = 0 and x2 not necessarily different from x1 . The polynomial p(x) can be written as p(x) = (x-x1 )(x-x2 )r(x) where r(x) has degree n - 2. Continuing this procedure recursively leads us to completely split the polynomial into linear factors x1 , x2 , . . . , xn such that p(x) = (x - x1 )(x - x2 ) · · · (x - xn )

Number of Roots

Before formulating the solution procedure to quartic polynomial equations, we discuss the number of roots of a polynomial equation. As we will see in Section 3, the transformations necessary for finding the zeros of a polynomial can lead us to the conclusion that a polynomial of degree n can have more than n zeros. In this section, we show that this kind of conclusion is incorrect for a polynomial whose coefficients belong to a subfield (F ) of the complex number field (C). Before dealing with number of roots, we introduce and discuss the quartic equations. A general quartic polynomial equation in a single variable is written in the form: a4 x4 + a3 x3 + a2 x2 + a1 x + a0 = 0

(1) Thus, we conclude that a polynomial of degree n has n zeros in the algebraically closed field C. with ai  F , i = 0, . . . , 4. Additionally, the field Using Theorem 2, we can conclude that the F contains the field of rational numbers (Q). The quartic polynomial in Eq. 1 has four zeros in C. left side of the equation 1 can be represented as a polynomial p(x), which belong to a polynomial Obviously, if the zeros we seek are located in a ring F [x]. Consequently, a polynomial ring con- subset instead of C, the number of zeros that we tains any polynomial of degree n with coefficients are interested in can be less than four. in F . The rest of the discussion is developed in the literature for any polynomial of degree n, thus 3 General Quartic Polynomial valid for an arbitrary polynomial in F [x]. We will let the zeros of a polynomial be an eleof a Single Variable ment of C even though the polynomial itself is an element of the polynomial ring F [x]. This lets us Obtaining the number of roots of the general quarto take advantage of the fundamental theorem of tic polynomial equation in F [x], we can proceed 2

We use =-  (9) k=- 2m 2 z-q Eq. 2 for the rest of the discussion without losing generality. Thus, the equation 7 becomes We proceed by applying Tschirnhaus transformation; thus, we let y = x + b3 /4 so that x = r2 1 2 ( my + k ) - + z2 - s (10) y - b3 /4. Substituting for x in Eq. 2, we obtain 4(z - q ) 4 the depressed [4] quartic polynomial equation as When Eq. 10 is a complete square, we must y 4 + qy 2 + ry + s = 0 (3) have 1 r2 + z2 - s = 0 (11) - where 4(z - q ) 4 Obviously, if Eq. 11 holds, then we have the 3 (4) square (my + k )2 . Therefore, we need to solve q = - b2 3 + b2 8 Eq. 11 to proceed finding the zeros of the quartic 1 3 1 b 3 - b3 b2 + b 1 r = polynomial. Since z is an open variable, we can 8 2 assume z = q .

with finding its roots. The procedure we offer is based on a method outlined in [4], which is a variation of Ferrari's solution. This method requires solving a resolvent cubic polynomial equation. Thus, in Section 3.1, we discuss finding the zeros of a cubic polynomial before we obtain the roots of the general quartic equation in Section 3.2. We start by considering the Eq. 1 of Section 2. The polynomial equation being quartic makes it necessary that a4 = 0, otherwise we would end up an equation of degree not equal to four. Using this fact, we can manipulate Eq. 1 to make the coefficient of the fourth power term one, that is, we can transform into a monic quartic polynomial equation. Thus, dividing both sides of the equation 1, we obtain:

We would like to complete the right side of Eq. 6 to a square, i.e. to a form (my + k )2 , as well. For this reason, we collect the terms of the right hand side of Eq. 6 in the variable y to obtain (z - q )y 2 - ry + Thus, we let m=  1 2 z -s 4 (7)

 In this section, we solve the resolvent cubic poly2 1 3  = cis =- +i (18) nomial, which is Eq. 12. We can make the 3 2 2 Tschinhaus transformation for the cubic polyno mial; thus, we let t = z - q/3 so that y = t + q/3. then 4  1 3 2 Substituting into Eq. 12, we obtain the depressed  = cis =- -i (19) 3 2 2 resolvent cubic polynomial equation as and  3 = 1.

Although we seem inator and considering that the numerator of the to have six solutions for Eq. 15, in turn for the equation is zero, we obtain resolvent cubic equation, we know this is not the g3 6 3 u + hu - =0 (15) case by Theorem 2. Thus, we need to make clean27 ing for obtaining the correct roots. We begin by Thus, we obtain a quadratic equation in u3 .

We know that any complex number a can be written in the form a = r(cos  + i sin ). As a consequence of De Moivre's theorem [5], we can write
3 Lemma 1. If u3 1 and u2 be two roots of Eq. 15, then u1 u2 = -g/3. 3 Proof. Suppose u3 1 and u2 are roots of Eq. 15. 3 Then, we can write (u - u3 1 )(u - u2 ) = 0. Hence, 3 3 3 3 we expand to u6 - (u3 1 + u2 )u + u1 u2 = 0, 3 thus, comparing to Eq. 15, we must have u3 1 u2 = -g 3 /27. Taking cube roots of both sides, we obtain u1 u2 = -g/3.

3 Taking the cube roots of u3 1 and u2 in Eq. 16, 2 we obtain three roots of u3 1 as u1 , u1 , and  u1 . an = rn (cos (n) + i sin (n)) Similarly, three cube roots of u3 2 are u2 , u2 , and Thus, if we write a0 in the form [3] rcis() =  2 u2 . We need to select from each of the three 3 r(cos  + i sin ), and let n = 1/3, we obtain the cube roots of u3 1 and u2 to obtain the roots of three cube roots x as the depressed cubic polynomial equation. For this   + 2 j purpose, we present Theorem 3. x = 3 r cis (17) 3 Theorem 3. Let u1 , u1 ,  2 u1 and u2 , u2 ,  2 u2  2 j  3 = r cis cis be roots of Eq. 15. We compute the zeros of the 3 3

depressed resolvent cubic polynomial in Eq. 13 by choosing one from each set of the roots according to the following cases 1. If we choose roots sucht that u1 u2 = -g/3, then t1 = u1 + u2 , t2 = u1 +  2 u2 , and t3 =  2 u1 + u2 . 2. If we choose roots such that u1 u2 = -g/3, then t1 = u1 + u2 , t2 = u1 + u2 , and t3 =  2 u1 +  2 u2 . 3. If we choose roots such that  2 u1 u2 = -g/3, then t1 = u1 +  2 u2 , t2 = u1 + u2 , and t3 =  2 u1 + u2 . Proof. We find the roots of the depressed resolvent cubic polynomial by transforming back from u to t by means of the equation g t=u- 3u We can arbitrarily take the cube roots of u1 to back substitute for u. We can verify that if we choose cube roots of u2 instead, we would obtain the same results. As a consequence of Lemma 1, we need to make sure compatible roots of Eq. 15 are chosen. The possibilities are u1 u2 =  3 u1 u2 = -g/3, u1 u2 =  4 u1 u2 = -g/3, and  2 u1 u2 - -g/3. Therefore, we consider the following cases

2. If u1 u2 = -g/3, then the back transformation equation becomes t=u+ u1 u2 u

Thus, for u = u1 , we obtain t1 = u1 + u2 Similarly, z = u1 would give us t2 = u1 + u2 and u =  2 u1 leads to t3 =  2 u1 + u1 u2 =  2 u1 +  2 u2 2  u1

Thus, t1 , t2 , t3 gives the solution set obtained in case 2 of the theorem. 3. If  2 u1 u2 = -g/3, then the back transformation equation becomes t=u+  2 u1 u2 u

Thus, for u = u1 , we obtain t1 = u1 +  2 u2 . Similarly, u = u1 and u =  2 u1 would give us t2 = u1 + u2 and t3 =  2 u1 + u2 , respectively. Hence, we obtained the solution set presented in case 3 of the theorem.

Consequently, we can write the general quartic polynomial equation in the form 1 (21) (y 2 + zi )2 = (mi y + ki )2 2 with zi being a root of the resolvent cubic polynomial equation and mi , ki being the values evaluated for the root zi . Since we have three roots from the resolvent cubic polynomial, it would be a natural question to choose which one for zi . We discussed in Section 2 that a quartic polynomial has exactly four zeros in C. Hence, we choose one of the three roots of the resolvent polynomial equation arbitrarily [2] while neglecting the others. Selecting zi , we can take the square roots of both sides of Eq. 21. Thus, we obtain the following two quadratic equations 1 (22) y 2 - mi y - ki + zi = 0 2 1 y 2 + mi y + ki + zi = 0 2

Case Study: Self-Reciprocal Quartic Polynomials

We formulated a solution algorithm to obtain roots of the general quartic polynomial equation in Section 3. The solution included solving a cubic resolvent of the quartic polynomial. Although, solving a cubic polynomial equation is necessary for the general quartic case, the method would be simpler if we consider specialization of the general quartic polynomial. One such specialization is a self-reciprocal quartic polynomial, which we study in this section. Under a suitable transformation, solution of self-reciprocal quartic polynomial equations reduce to solving two quadratic polynomials. Definition 1 (Self-Reciprocal Quartic Polynomial). Let F be a subfield of the field of the real numbers (R). A quartic polynomial f  F [x] given by the equation 1 is self-reciprocal under the condition that f (x) = f  (1/x) with f   F [x] defined as:

We obtain the depressed quartic polynomial equation by using the transformation x = y + 213/200. Using Eq. 4, we compute q = -208999/640000, r = -7921683/64000000, and s = -1226099903/25600000000.

Thus, we can obtain the roots of a self-reciprocal quartic equation without having to solve a resolvent cubic polynomial equation.

Making another transformation, which would be z = t - 208999/1920000, we compute g = 306768959/1966080000 and h = 6560810064991/226492416000000 by using Eq. 15. Thus, we obtain the depressed resolvent cubic as t3 + 6560810064991 306768959 t+ =0 1966080000 226492416000000

To continue solution of the quartic polynomial equation, we arbitrarily pick z1 and calculate m = 0.636776 + i0.328601 and k = 0.0767513 - i0.0396066 by using Eq. 8 and Eq. 9, respectively. We then use Eq. 23 through Eq. 26 to find the zeros of the depressed quartic polynomial, and back substitute for xi x i = yi + to obtain x1 x2 x3 x4 = = = = 0.944469 + i0.328601 1.82231 0.548755 + i1.49012 × 10-8 0.944469 - i0.328601 213 200 i = 1, . . . , 4

Neglecting the small imaginary number in x3 as a consequence of the Sagemath computational errors, the results xi are in agreement with that the solution method 1 and also with the result available in [3].

We will present the rest of the solution in decimal form to save space. We note that u3 Conclusion 1 = 5 3 0.0332042 cis and u2 = 0.00423715 cis0.
