Abstract
We study determining the posture of an in-parallel planar manipulator, which has three connectors composed of revolute, prismatic and revolute joints, from specified active joint variables. We construct an ideal in the field of complex numbers, and we introduce self inversive polynomials. We provide results for an in-parallel planar manipulator, which has a base and moving platform in right triangular shape. Using Sage computer algebra system, we compute its Groebner bases. We illustrate that the single variable polynomials obtained from the Groebner bases are self reciprocal.

Introduction

In-parallel planar manipulators bring advantages to their application fields since they provide good load carrying capacity and accuracy; furthermore, these manipulators exhibit a simple kinematic structure. An in-parallel manipulator is composed of connectors as defined in Duffy [1], which are serial identical kinematic chains, a fixed base, and a moving platform. Each of the connectors, acting between the base and the moving platform, has at most one actuator. While the kinematic structure of an in-parallel planar manipulator is relatively simple, a forward position analysis of such manipulators, which involves determining the posture of the moving platform for given active joint displacements, can be difficult. There are studies on solving this prob1

lem by using parametrization in the field of real numbers (R). Nielsen and Roth [2] reported developments related to computational and numerical solution techniques of this problem including polynomial continuation and Groebner bases theory; furthermore, they presented application of the elimination methods to serial and parallel manipulators. As opposed to commonly used methods in solving the forward position analysis problem of planar manipulators as reported in [2], which are parametrized in the field of real numbers (R), we obtain the solution of the equations in the algebraically closed field of complex numbers (C). A few studies on using complex number methods are available in the literature. For example, Shigley et al. [3] used complex number methods to study the position analysis of closedloop mechanisms. However, they treated complex numbers as an algebraic manipulation tool; therefore, they obtained solutions by utilizing the real and imaginary components of the resulting equations in R. Another study available is by Wampler[4], who utilized numerical and matrix methods to solve forward position analysis problem of a closed-loop mechanism. The numerical method in [4], which was formulated in the Gauss plane led to solution in the field of complex numbers C. Nevertheless, we attempt to solve the forward position analysis problem of an in-parallel planar manipulator in C by using Groebner bases theory, which is one of the fundamental computational tools in algebraic geometry. The method in this study leads us to self reciprocal polynomials, which typically appear in problems involving

unit circle. These polynomials do not seem to be reported in kinematics literature before, yet there are studies in mathematics. For example, DiazBarrero and Egozcue [5] studied a methodology for constructing self inversive polynomials. We do not construct such polynomials in this study, but we obtain them from the algorithm for computing the Groebner basis. The in-parallel planar parallel manipulator, which is used in this study has three connectors composed of revolute, prismatic, and revolute (3RPR) joints. In Section 2, we introduce inversion in the unit circle and derive self inversive polynomials, which possess a point and its inverse as roots. In Section 3, we discuss variety of an ideal, then solve the forward position problem of the manipulator by using the elimination ideals of its Groebner basis. We utilize the position equations of the 3RPR manipulator in the Gauss plane, which was derived in Sahin [6], in Section 3. Computer algebra systems are widely used in computing Groebner bases; thus, we use Sage mathematical software [7] for computations in the field of Gaussian Rational numbers (Q(i)). We perform simulations which give two and four solutions­the 3RPR manipulator may have up to six solutions [1]­for the forward position analysis problem; additionally, we illustrate the inversive nature of the solutions in the unit circle. We draw the assembly configurations to illustrate the possible postures of the manipulator for each simulations.

Therefore, inversion is cyclic and has period two. We represent the inversion in the Gauss plane by using the equation |z - c||z - c| = r2 , z being the affix of the point Z in the Gauss plane. Consequently, we provide the following theorem the proof of which is available in [8]. Theorem 1. Inversion in a circle with center C and radius r has the complex representation (z - c)(z - c) = r2 If we replace the center C of the circle  in Fig.3 to coincide with the origin O, then we can use Theorem 1 to obtain inversion in the unit circle. Consequently, substituting c = 0, and the radius r = 1 into the equation given in Theorem 1, we obtain the Corollary 1. Corollary 1. Inversion in the unit circle S has the complex representation z = z 1 = 2 z |z | (1)

Inversion of Points in the Unit Circle

This section includes background in inversive points and inversion in the unit circle as well as self reciprocal polynomials and their relation to inversive points. To begin with, we refer to Fig. 1, where a circle  centered at C with radius r and a point Z different from C are given. We find a point Z on the ray through CZ such that (CZ ) · (CZ ) = r2 ; thus, the point Z is the inverse of Z in the circle 2

Hence, we can calculate the inverse of a point z in S by using Eq. 1. For example, if we pick a point Z on S, then its inverse is z = z/|z |2 = z . Thus, points on S are invariant. Nevertheless, if we pick a point outside (inside) S, then we will obtain the image inside (outside) the circle. Therefore, inversion turns S inside-out, as referred to by

polynomial satisfying f (z ) = z n f + (1/z ) self reciprocal. In this case, the reciprocal 1/z of the root z is also a root of f . We refer to Fig. 1 again with the circle being S. Furthermore, we let the line on which Z , Z lie be collinear with the real axis. Denoting the intersection points of S with the real axis as X = (-1, 0) and Y = (1, 0), we prove the proposition 1 by using the notion of a harmonic conjugate. As given in Pedoe [11], the points Z and Z are harmonic f (z ) = cn z n + cn-1 z n-1 + · · · + c1 z + c0 (2) conjugates with respect to the segment |XY| if Let us suppose that the inverse 1/z is also root of the Eq. 6 is satisfied. the polynomial in Eq. 2. Then, we must have ZX ZX =- (6) ZY ZY 1 n 1 n-1 1 cn ( ) + cn-1 ( ) + · · · + c1 + c0 = 0 (3) where the bold variables in the fractions denote diz z z If we multiply Eq. 3 by z n and take the conjugate rected line segments. Thus, we are ready to prove Proposition 1. of the resulting equation, we obtain Coxeter and Greitzer [9]. Thus, we can think of the Gauss plane as composed of three partitions, the unit circle, inside and outside by using inversion in the unit circle. We can use inversion to investigate the roots of a polynomial in a single variable, whose coefficients are defined in C. Thus, we pick z as the root of such a polynomial, which is given by Eq. 2. Proposition 1. Let z = 1/z be the reciprocal of a cn-i z = 0 (4) real number z obtained from inversion in the unit circle. Then, Z and Z are harmonic conjugates i=0 Thus, we obtain the polynomial f  , which is with respect to the intersection points X and Y of known as the (conjugate) reciprocal of the poly- the unit circle with the real axis. nomial f . Consequently, we call f as a self in- Proof. Referring to Fig. 1, and using the Eq. 6, versive polynomial since f (z ) = f  (z ).

Therefore we conclude that Z and Z are harThe converse of this statement is also true. To il- monic conjugates with respect to |XY|. lustrate this, we let z be the root of a self inversive Thus, if we have inversion of a point in the unit polynomial f . Hence we write f  (z ) = 0. So, z n f (1/z ) = 0. Since z = 0, we have f (1/z ) = 0; circle along the real axis, then the pair of points thus, f (1/z ) = 0. Therefore, we conclude that are harmonic conjugates. 1/z is also a root of the self inversive polynomial. Yet, we consider a special case of self inversive 3 Solution of the Position polynomials.

If I = f1 , f2 , . . . , f8 , then V(I ) = Proof. We use the definition of the ideal in the V(f1 , . . . , f8 ). proof: Proof. We let (cisa , . . . cis )  V(I ). So, for fi  I , we use Eq. 7 to write f = 8 i=1 hi fi  I with 1. f1 , f2 , . . . , f8 has zero element: We write hi  C[cisa , cisb , cisc , cis , cisa , cisb , cisc , cis ]. 8 i=1 0fi = 0 for 0  C. Thus, f (cisa , . . . , cis ) = 0, and in particular, 2. f1 , f2 , . . . , f8 is closed under addi- fi (cisa , . . . , cis ) = 0.

Since fi (cisa , . . . , cis ) = 0, we C[cisa , cisb , cisc , cis , cisa , cisa , cisb , cisc , cis ] write f = 8 Then, the equation i=1 hi fi = 0. Because f1 , . . . , f8  I , we write f  I .

Thus, as a consequence of the forward position problem, we would like to find the set V(I ) = V(f1 , . . . , f8 ) for given fi in the Proposition 2. We can use Groebner bases theory to find V(I ). The Groebner basis is a set of polynomials the leading terms of which generate the same ideal as that of the leading terms of the ideal. Consequently, a Groebner basis of the ideal I is a basis of I . Thus, the solution of the Groebner basis would give us V(I ). Additional information about Groebner bases theory and the associated Buchberger algorithm can be found in [12]. We compute the Groebner basis in the numerical examples by using Sage computer algebra system. The computations are performed in the field of Gaussian rational numbers (Q(i)) with the following lex order cisa >lex cisb >lex cisc >lex cis >lex cisa >lex cisb >lex cisc >lex cis . The 3RPR in-parallel manipulator has a base and the moving platform in right triangular shapes. In particular, we use lac = 4, lab = 3, dac = 8i, dab = 6, and cis = cis(/2) = i as the numerical data in the examples. We substitute these values together with the connector lengths to each fi of the Proposition 2 for the solution. We provide two examples for computations. In the first example, we use the numerical values for the connector lengths as sa = 2, sb = 7/2, and sc = 5/2. In the second numerical example, we use the connector lengths sa = 7/2, sb = 6, and sc = 15/2.

lex order. To find the polynomials constituting the Il , we use Groebner basis. For a basis G associated with the ideal I , we write Gl = G  C[cisl+1 , . . . , cis ] as the Groebner basis of the l-th elimination ideal Il [12]. For each of the Gl , we find the corresponding partial solution set, V(Il ). Then, we increase the variables by one and form the Groebner basis Gl-1 of the ideal Il-1 . We calculate the additional coordinate and stack to the partial solution. We repeat until we find all the coordinates. 3.1.1 Solution Set for Example 1

For the example with connector lengths sa = 2, sb = 7/2, and sc = 5/2, we compute the Groebner basis and include it in the Appendix A.

We solve the polynomial equations by using elimination ideals. For I = f1 , . . . , f8 , we define the l-th elimination ideal Il as Il = I  C[cisl+1 , . . . , cis ] where C[cisl+1 , . . . , cis ] represents the remaining 8 - l elements of cisa , . . . , cis . Thus, the elimination ideal Il contains polynomials only in terms of cisl+1 , . . . , cis , which are written according to 5

Thus, we find that two of the solutions are real while the other two are complex conjugates located on S. Furthermore, we observe that the real roots form an inversive pair. By Proposition 1, we conclude that the real roots are harmonic conjugates.

Conclusion

In this paper, we solve the position equations of a 3RPR in-parallel planar manipulator, which are essentially linear equations with the constraints associated with revolute joints, in the Gauss plane in order to obtain the posture of the moving platform. We use Groebner bases theory to obtain the solution of the resulting ideal consisting of four planes and circles. As can be seen from the concrete examples for the 3RPR manipulator, the elimination ideal which contain only the single variable polynomial are used as the base step for

The single variable polynomials are self reciprocal in Q(i), thus we obtain either points on the circle or on the real axis. Thus, we obtain either harmonic conjugates on the real line or complex conjugates on the unit circle. This behavior of the polynomials in solving the forward position analysis of the manipulator is not observed in other studies using R in the literature, or which use numerical methods. Thus, as a conclusion, we emphasize the importance of working in the field C, which is algebraically closed. While parametrization of spatial manipulators does not appear to be convenient in C, this fact allows us to inspect position analysis of planar manipulators in more detail in C by using tools from algebra and geometry.
