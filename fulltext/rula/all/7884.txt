Abstract
We study parametric equations, which describe the position of an in-parallel planar manipulator. We discuss isometries in the Gauss plane, then we write the loop-closure equations in terms of the rotations as the parameters.

The organization of this short paper is as follows: we discuss the geometric foundations for obtaining the position equations for the 3RPR in-parallel manipulator in Section 2; specifically, we discuss the complex numbers, isometries and transformations in the Gauss plane. In Section 3, we derive the loop­closure equations of the manipulator.

Introduction

Complex Numbers

A 3RPR parallel manipulator, which is a closedloop linkage, consists of a moving platform­a ternary link­and three simple kinematic chains, each composed of revolute, prismatic, and revolute joints, attached to vertices of the moving platform. The position equations are essential in mathematical modeling of the 3RPR parallel manipulators. In the literature, the position equations are generally obtained by means of parametrizations in the Euclidean plane. For example, Shigley and Uicker [3] used loop-closure equations in obtaining the equations describing the position of closed-loop linkages in terms of trigonometric functions. As another example, Wampler [5] studied parametric equations of closed-loop linkages in the Gauss plane. In this study, we obtain the position equations of the 3RPR parallel manipulator in the Gauss plane with a similar approach to that of Wampler [5], which he applied to a closed-loop mechanism in his study. However, we will concentrate more on geometry instead of mechanical motions; thus, we emphasize isometries and transformations, and use loop-closure equations directly. 1

In this section, we study properties of complex numbers. Additionally, we discuss isometries in the Gauss plane.

We define complex numbers, which represent points in the Cartesian plane, as a set C = {x + iy : x, y  R, i2 = -1}. Denoting the x-axis of the Cartesian plane as the real axis and y -axis as the imaginary axis, we obtain a different interpretation of the Cartesian plane, and we name it as the Gauss plane [1]. We affiliate a point Z in the Gauss plane by a complex number z and name x +iy as the rectangular form of z . Thus, the set of complex numbers C, with identity elements for complex addition and multiplication being 0 and 1, forms a field. As an alternative to the rectangular form, for a given point, we define r as the length of the line segment from the origin to the point (amplitude), and  as the angle formed by the real axis and the line segment (argument). Thus, a

point Z in the Gauss plane can be expressed as by using a similar argument to the case of n = z = rcis(), where cis is defined in Definition 1. 2, and by substituting the expression for n - 1. Therefore, we conclude the equation 1 holds in Definition 1. We let the set of points on a unit C. circle and its associated argument be denoted as We prove the equation 2 similarly. Letting S and , respectively. Then, we define cis : S  n = 1, we observe that the equation becomes C such that cis() = cos () + i sin (). trivially z 1 = z 1 . Next, we let n = 2. Thus, we In addition to using C for representing points write: in the Gauss plane, we can also express vectors z1 z2 = (x1 + i y1 )(x2 + i y2 ) by means of C. Hence, a directed line from the origin at 0 to the point x + iy represents a vec= (x1 x2 - y1 y2 ) - i (x1 y2 + y1 x2 ) tor. The orthonormal vectors coincident with the = (x1 - i y1 )(x2 - i y2 ) coordinate axis would be 1 and i, respectively. = z1 z2 Thus, any vector can be written as a linear combination of 1 and i as z = x1 + y i. We drop Now, we suppose that the equation 2 holds for 1 from this expression [1]; furthermore, since i n - 1. Thus, z1 z2 · · · zn-1 = z 1 z 2 · · · z n-1 . has only imaginary component, we use i in vec- Therefore, for n, we write: tor expressions instead of i. Therefore, we exz1 z2 · · · zn = z1 z2 · · · zn-1 z n press a vector z by using the standard representations of the complex numbers, so z = z in C. = z 1 z 2 · · · z n-1 z n The conjugate of a complex number z = x + iy  C, which is written as z = x - iy , can be Thus, we conclude that the equation 2 holds. viewed as an operation on C. So, we provide Proposition 1 [2] on the conjugate of addition 2.2 Isometries in the Gauss Plane and multiplication of complex numbers. The isometries with which we are interested Proposition 1. Let z1 , z2 , . . . , zn  C. Then, are reflections, translations, and rotations. The z1 + z2 + · · · + zn = z 1 + z 2 + · · · + z n (1) propositions in this section, except for 5, are available­without proofs­in [1]. We introduce and furthermore, reflections in the Gauss plane by means of the z1 z2 · · · zn = z 1 z 2 · · · z n (2) complex conjugates. Since the reflection is a mirror about a line, we write: Proof. We prove the equation 1 first. The case of n = 1 is trivially satisfied. Then, we pick n = 2 to obtain z1 + z2 = x1 + i y1 + x2 + i y2 = x1 + x2 - i (y1 + y2 ) = x1 - i y1 + x2 - i y2 = z 1 + z 2 . Thus, the equation holds for n = 2. Now, we suppose that the equation is true for n-1. Therefore, z1 + z2 + · · · + zn-1 = z 1 + z 2 + · · · + z n-1 . Hence, we can write z1 + z2 + · · · + zn = z1 + z2 + · · · + zn-1 +z n = z 1 + z 2 + · · · + z n-1 +z n 2 Proposition 2. A reflection z of z  C in the x-axis has the equation: z =z (3)

Proof. Because the reflection is in the x-axis, we have the real and imaginary components of z in the mirror as x = x and y = -y . Thus, z = x - iy = z . A translation shifts the objects in the Gauss plane by a vector a  C. For a given translation a = h + ik arising from the origin, we can find the location of z initially at z . Consequently, we write:

Proposition 3. A translation of an object from z Proof. We claim that: to z by means of a is: cis(1 +2 +· · ·+n ) = cis(1 )·cis(2 ) · · · cis(n ) z =z+a (4) We pick 1 , 2  R. Then, we write Proof. We suppose a is the translation which acts on z . Then, the point associated with z would shift to z . Using the vectors related to z and z , we find that z is the diagonal of the parallelogram whose sides are a and z . Therefore, we conclude that z = z + a. cis(1 + 2 ) = cos(1 + 2 ) + i sin(1 + 2 ) = cos(1 )(cos(2 ) + i sin(2 )) +i2 sin(1 )(sin(2 ) -i cos(2 )) = cis(1 ) · cis(2 )

We introduce the rotations by means of the Now, we suppose that unit circle centered in the origin of the Gauss cis(1 + 2 + · · · + n-1 ) = cis(1 ) · cis(2 ) plane. Consider a unit vector arising from the · · · cis(n-1 ) origin to a point on the unit circle, and has the angle  as its argument. If we rotate this vector So, we can write by an angle , then we obtain the new position cis(1 + · · · + n ) = cis(1 + · · · + n-1 ) of the vector as cis( + ) using the Definition ·cis(n ) 1. Hence, the function cis is used to express ro= cis(1 ) · · · · · cis(n-1 ) tations in the Gauss plane. Thus, we introduce Proposition 4 for expressing rotations. ·cis(n ) Proposition 4. A rotation of an object z about a Therefore, we conclude that cis is a homomorpoint A by an angle , which results in the vector phism between R with addition, and C with multiplication. z , has the following representation: z - a = cis()(z - a) (5) We can use cis and cis as a pair to express the unit circle S. Consequently, we write: Proposition 6. We let   R. The unit circle S can be represented as cis()cis() = 1. Proof. Pick   R. Then, cis() · cis() = (cos() + i sin()) · (cos() - i sin()) = cos2 () + sin2 () = 1. Therefore, cis() · cis() = 1 represents the unit circle. The pair (cis, cis)  S2  C2 is used in the parametrization of position equations. Specifically, we would like to obtain relations between the unit circle S, complex numbers C2 and the Cartesian coordinates in R2 . Thus, we define (x, y ) : C2  R2 with x(cis, cis) = (cis+cis)/2, y (cis, cis) = (-i(cis - cis))/2. Similarly, we define  : R2  S as  = atan2(y, x). Hence, we draw the Fig. 1 to obtain the function  : C2  S. Consequently,  =   (x, y ), and therefore  = atan2 -i(cis - cis), (cis + cis) 3 (6)

Proof. We let z be the new vector as a result of the rotation, and z the original vector. Additionally, we let a be the vector associated with the point A. Then, we write r = z - a and r = z - a. Thus, using the rotation function cis, we obtain r = cis()r. Therefore, substituting back for the difference vectors r and r , we obtain z - a = cis()(z - a). We observe that the angular quantities are additive; that is, the angles i associated with successive rotations can be added to obtain the resulting angle as  = 1 + · · · + n . We would like to obtain a similar relation to obtain a resulting rotation for given successive rotations. Thus, we provide the following proposition: Proposition 5. The function cis : R  S is a homomorphism between R with the addition and the S with multiplication operations.

The equations describing the posture of the inparallel planar manipulator, which has three degrees of freedom, can be obtained by means of loop-closure equations. As an initial step, we would like to obtain the number of loops, which determines the quantity of the loop-closure equations, for this manipulator. A general formula for calculating the number of loops is given by Waldron and Kinzel [4] as L = j + 1 - n, with j being the total number of joints, and n being the total number of links. We apply this formula to the 3RPR manipulator in Fig. 2; we observe that j = 9, n = 8. Thus, we calculate L = 9 + 1 - 8 = 2 loops; therefore, we can write two independent loop-closure equations for this manipulator. For the 3RPR manipulator shown in Fig. 2, we let sa = |AOa |, sb = |BOb |, and sc = |COc | be the lengths of each connectors. We denote the unknown joint variables by a , b , c , and . The first loop that we will consider is through the joints at A, Oa , Ob , and B . We let dab be the vector arising from the origin at A to the point B , oa and ob be the vectors originating from A, which are associated with the points Oa and Ob . We would like to obtain the loop-closure equation in terms of cis, cis, and the prismatic joint variable s. Thus, we pick a line AA , which connects the point A at the origin of the coordinate frame to the point A at center of the chamber of the prismatic joint as in Fig. 2, collinear with the real axis of the coordinate frame. Then, we perform a rotation AA by an angle a , followed by a translation by an amount of A Oa along the 4

rotated line. This motion sequence results in the position at Oa , the associated vector of which can be expressed as (|AA | + |A Oa |)cis(a ); hence, |AOa |cis(a ). Therefore, we can write oa = sa cis(a ). Next, we consider the rotation which transforms the side of the moving platform by an angle . Using the Proposition 4, we write ob - oa = cis()(ob - oa ), where ob is the vector associated with Ob before the rotation. But oab = ob - oa ; thus, ob = oa +cis()lab , where lab = |oab | = |Oa Ob |. As a next step, we draw a line parallel to the real axis and passing through Ob ; thus, from the transversal passing through B and Ob , we find the angle associated with the joint at Ob as b +  . Then, denoting endpoint of the piston of the prismatic joint as B in the Figure 2, we calculate the position of the point B , which is a result of rotation about Ob , as b - ob = cis(b +  )|Ob B |. Furthermore, we write the translation from B to B as b = b +cis(b + )|B B |. Eliminating b and substituting sb = |Ob B |+|B B |, we obtain b = ob + cis(b +  )sb . Then, using the Proposition 5, we write b = ob + cis(b )cis( )sb = ob - cis(b )sb . As a final step for closing the loop, we translate b by dba to obtain a = b + dba ; additionally,

noting dba = -dab , and a = 0 for A being the sa cisa + lac cis cis - sc cisc - dac = 0 (10) origin of the fixed frame, we write 0 = b - dab .
