Abstract   The  following  Major  Research  Paper  (MRP)  focuses  on  the  discussion  of  opioids  in  

Canada,  online  news  outlets,  and  social  media.  More  specifically,  this  research  focuses   on  the  Canadian  Broadcasting  Corporation  (CBC),  and  how  the  organization  frames  the   opioid  crisis  on  Twitter  through  @CBCNews.  This  research  excludes  other  CBC  Twitter   accounts  (i.e.,  @CBC,  @CBCAlerts,  @CBCOttawa,  @CBCToronto,  @CBCManitoba,   @CBCPolitics,  @CBCCanada),  as  @CBCNews  is  the  most  active  with  2.62  million   followers.   The  following  discussion  considers  the  opioid  discussion  from  a  crisis   communication  lens.  This  research  asserts  that  there  is  an  apparent  opioid  crisis,  given   the  situation's  complexity,  and  number  of  opioid-related  deaths.  This  research  questions   how  social  media  (specifically  Twitter)  act  as  a  tool  for  information  dissemination  during   a  health-related  crisis,  and  how  external  factors  (i.e.,  public  opinion,  bias,  and  current   affairs)  shape  news  content  online.  Without  understanding  the  narrative  (i.e.,  how  a   story  is  intentionally  told)  and  strategies  behind  social  media  posts,  news  outlets  like  the   CBC  can  promote  hidden  agendas  and  ideals  (without  a  large  amount  of  public   knowledge  or  opposition).  The  CBC  has  goals,  commitments,  and  preconceived  notions   like  any  other  private  organization.   This  reality  is  incredibly  problematic  during  a  public  health  crisis,  as  human  lives   depend  on  appropriate  and  trustworthy  information.  Instead  of  discussing  an  issue   without  bias  or  pre-conception,  news  outlets  may  provide  subjective,  false  or  vague   information,  which  could  lead  to  negative  repercussions  (Kim  &  Hyojung,  2017).  Due  to   private  motivations,  the  intent  to  control  the  opioid  conversation  (through  politically- driven  content,  stigma-driven  content  or  to  even  place  blame,  for  example)  or  the   3     

promotion  of  ideas  beneficial  to  pharmaceutical  companies,  for  example,  do  news   sources  frame  Twitter  posts  with  a  specific  narrative  in  mind?   Instead  of  analyzing  social  media  as  an  enabler  or  an  initiator  of  framing  crisis   online,  this  research  focuses  on  how  news  outlets  frame  crises  through  social  media  as   one  of  many  possible  media  channels.  Examining  how  social  media  as  a  platform  acts   as  an  echo  chamber  (therefore  enabling  an  intended  narrative)  is  an  interesting  concept.   However,  this  type  of  analysis  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  research.  As  a  result,  the   following  Major  Research  Paper  explores  the  following  primary  research  questions:     1.   How  does  the  CBC  frame  the  issue  of  opioid  usage  in  Canada?  In  addition,   why  are  their  Twitter  posts  framed  a  certain  way?   2.   What  is  the  nature  of  the  dialogue  occurring  in  response  to  the  CBC's  Twitter   coverage?  What  strategies  are  most  conducive  to  audience  response?   3.   How  are  fluctuations  and  outliers  in  news  coverage  accounted  for  by  the  CBC?   Do  socially  and/or  politically  driven  events  impact  the  timing  of  posts?      Keywords:  social  media,  crisis,  communication,  opioid  crisis,  strategy,  political,   narrative,  framing,  Canada,  fentanyl,  naloxone.                        4

Introduction   Social  media  are  changing  the  contemporary  media  landscape.  Once  created  to  

unite  friends,  these  tools  of  mass  connection  now  influence  our  social  lives  and  how  we   communicate.  From  the  interpersonal,  mass-mediated,  educational,  organizational  to   the  political  (Sheldon,  2015),  almost  all  facets  of  life  involve  social  media   communication.  Therefore,  many  individuals  rely  on  social  media  as  their  primary   source  of  information  gathering  (Shearer  &  Gottfried,  2017).  Because  most  news  outlets   exist  online,  specifically  with  active  social  media  channels,  individuals  that  maintain  their   knowledge  of  current  affairs  can  go  online  and  consume  information  immediately.     As  a  result,  social  media  are  not  only  used  as  a  tool  for  one-way  communication   (i.e.,  without  interacting  with  the  intended  audience)  but  also  act  as  a  conversation   starter  between  multiple  parties.  With  the  ability  to  comment,  like,  and  share  any  single   post  (whether  from  a  news  outlet  or  an  average  individual),  the  amount  of  available   information  online  is  infinite.  When  information  exists  on  such  a  large  scale  from  a   variety  of  different  authors,  the  authenticity  of  the  information  requires  questioning.  A   primary  struggle  exists  when  obtaining  news  from  social  media:  are  news  sources   framing  articles  with  a  specific  narrative  or  external  motivation  in  mind?   According  to  Knobloch-Westerwick  (2017),  a  wide  variety  of  messages  from  within   a  specific  post,  news  article  or  television  show  (for  example)  convey  biased  information.   Furthermore,  while  media  outlets  appeal  first  and  foremost  to  "entertainment  needs"   (i.e.,  topics  that  are  easily  readable),  amusement,  and  emotional  involvement,  ulterior   motivations  are  always  present  (Knobloch-Westerwick,  2017).  In  other  words,  the   prevalence  of  personal  or  organizational  motivations  are  existent  regardless  of  the   medium  used  to  communicate.  Because  most  media  disseminate  content  (whether   8     

satirically  or  seriously),  there  is  no  established  structure  to  evaluate  or  gauge  the  bias  of   a  post.  Unless  one  is  incredibly  informed  or  educated  on  the  topic  in  question,  readers   may  find  it  difficult  to  discern  the  severity  or  impact  of  content.  In  the  current  social   media  consumption  age,  politically-driven  posts  are  especially  problematic;  readers  may   not  understand  the  intention  of  a  specifically  framed  post.  Concerning  news  media,   readers  may  not  understand  whether  a  narrative  exists  at  all.  Instead,  social  media   users  may  take  the  information  at  face  value  without  questioning  the  origin  of  the   content,  why  the  content  was  published  at  the  current  time,  the  post's  intended   audience,  and  whom  the  post  may  (or  may  not)  directly  or  indirectly  effect.     Alongside  political  biases,  news  and  media  outlets  also  portray  both  evident  and   subliminal  personal  and  ethical  biases.  Although  these  narratives  can  turn  into  a  political   discussion,  they  are  not  directly  political  in  nature.  For  example,  when  looking  at  drug   addiction,  personal  narratives  are  increasingly  common  in  popular  culture.  According  to   Pienaar  and  Dilkes-Frayne  (2017),  "stories  most  prevalent  in  the  media  often  rely  on   stereotypes  and  offer  few  clues  about  the  variety  of  experiences  people  have  and  the   many  ways  they  cope  and  live  rich,  meaningful  lives"  (Pienaar  &  Dilkes-Frayne,  2017).   Instead  of  discussing  topics  with  empirical,  fact-based  information,  the  popular   conversation  revolves  around  opinion.     With  drug  addiction,  popular  narratives  can  quite  easily  focus  on  underprivileged,   disenfranchised,  and  neglected  populations.  By  no  means  should  the  conversation   neglect  this  narrative;  however,  an  individual's  preconceived  notion  of  an  addict  may   neglect  drug  users  who  are  financially  stable  or  are  within  a  non-marginalized   population.  When  opinion  plays  a  more  significant  role  in  the  dissemination  and  framing   of  information  (as  opposed  to  unbiased  and  fact-based  information),  the  root  of  the   9     

problem  will  never  warrant  appropriate  discussion.  In  an  age  where  the  average   individual  with  a  Twitter  account  can  promote  their  opinion  at  a  moment's  notice  (no   matter  how  radical  or  incorrect),  this  reality  is  increasingly  problematic  for  serious  issues   online.  The  power  to  promote  information  (whether  correct,  incorrect,  politically  charged,   or  personally  biased)  is  increasingly  difficult  to  challenge  and  track.   Fortunately,  readers  of  news  media  are  increasingly  skeptical  about  the  validity   and  stance  of  many  news  outlets.  With  the  rise  of  Donald  Trump  and  the  "fake  news"   phenomenon,  consumers  of  news  media  understand  that  news  outlets  publish  biased   content  (McNair,  2017).  Whether  the  "fake  news"  phenomenon  holds  merit,  readers   should  promote  a  healthy  skepticism  of  politically  and  socially  driven  content.   Regardless  of  political  standing,  a  news  source  could  theoretically  publish  content   geared  towards  one  end  of  the  political  spectrum  (i.e.,  left  versus  right).  Therefore,  the   reader  becomes  responsible  for  determining  the  validity  of  the  content  and  its  bias.  At   the  most  fundamental  level,  the  ability  to  challenge  news  media  and  to  communicate   opinions  that  may  challenge  the  status  quo  is  built  into  Canadian  democracy.  By   understanding  the  underlying  narratives  promoted  by  all  content  publishers,  the  largest   underlying  problems  may  spark  appropriate  discussion.   Finding  unbiased,  accurate  and  timely  information  is  not  always  realistic.  This   reality  is  true  during  a  healthcare-related  crisis,  more  notably,  the  opioid  crisis.   According  to  Entman  (2007),  framing  works  to  shape  and  alter  audience  members'   interpretations.  In  other  words,  narratives  can  introduce  the  idea  that  certain  opinions   garner  increased  attention.  This  strategy  encourages  the  targeted  audience  to  think  and   feel  a  certain  way  about  an  issue  (Entman,  2007).  During  a  healthcare  crisis,  we  may  

10     

not  look  for  a  narrative  (or  understand  a  specific  hidden  message).  Instead,  because  of   the  severity  of  the  issue,  we  may  believe  the  information  that  is  most  available.     The  opioid  crisis  is  unlike  most  health  crises.  While  it  does  resemble  other  health   crises  (i.e.,  an  airborne  disease  or  chronic  illness),  the  opioid  crisis  is  unique  in  that  it   often  involves  the  over-prescription  of  medication  by  doctors,  economic  and  social   upheaval,  psychological  trauma,  disadvantage,  and  loneliness  (Dasgupta,  Beletsky  &   Ciccarone,  2018).  Nevertheless,  4,000  Canadians  died  from  an  opioid-related  overdose   in  2017  (Canadian  Institute  for  Health  Information,  2018).  As  a  result,  there  is  a  gap  in   research  that  analyses  how  news  outlets  frame  the  opioid  crisis.  Furthermore,  because   social  media  is  an  integrated  part  of  our  society,  research  must  exist  that  examines  the   interplay  of  both  crisis  narratives  and  social  media  strategy.     The  way  news  outlets  shape  and  create  narratives  can  impact  the  lives  of  many.   During  health-related  crises,  which  often  illicit  a  high  level  of  concern,  news  outlets  must   be  concise,  accurate  and  unbiased.  According  to  Zelizer  (2015),  "crisis  always  requires   a  response"  and  "letting  it  run  its  course  does  not  work"  (Zelizer,  2015,  p.  893).  If  crises   always  warrant  a  response,  what  response  is  most  appropriate  and  beneficial  to  the   public?  Until  we  understand  how  news  outlets  use  specific  narratives  to  alter  public   perception,  they  will  hold  the  upper  hand  on  the  discussion.  The  following  research   attempts  to  answer  these  questions  by  illuminating  the  specific  narrative  strategies  used   by  the  CBC's  Twitter  account  (@CBCNews).  The  CBC,  a  public  broadcaster  and  crown   corporation,  is  a  unique  case  as  it  has  different  targets,  stakeholders,  and  funding   models  than  other  news  outlets  in  Canada.  Furthermore,  due  to  its  lasting  historical   connection  with  Canada  (as  the  oldest  existing  broadcasting  network),  the  CBC  is   uniquely  positioned  as  a  major  source  of  news  in  the  country.  With  these  factors  in   11     

mind,  this  research  examines  the  response  to  specific  posts  that  discuss  opioid  usage,   and  whether  fluctuations  in  news  coverage  are  a  response  to  external  factors  (i.e.,   political  campaigns  or  the  opening  of  a  safe  injection  site).   vi.   Background  &  History  of  the  Opioid  Crisis   The  opioid  crisis  is  not  a  new  phenomenon.  As  early  as  1999,  opioids  were  a   leading  cause  of  drug  overdose  deaths.  According  to  Vadivelu,  Kai,  Kodumudi,  Sramcik,   and  Kaye  (2018),  the  amount  of  opioid-related  overdose  deaths  increased  3-fold  in  the   United  States  (Vadivelu,  Kai,  Kodumudi,  Sramcik  &  Kaye,  2018).  In  Ontario  alone,   treatment  for  opioid  addictions  increased  from  6,000  patients  in  the  year  2000  to  40,000   patients  in  the  year  2016  (Morin,  Eibl,  Franklyn  &  Marsh,  2017).  The  number  of  physical   casualties  that  exist  as  a  direct  result  of  opioid  addiction  and  overdose  are  alarming.   According  to  Sandilands  and  Bateman  (2016,  p.  187),  opioids  cause  a  "well- recognized  toxidrome  including  respiratory  depression,  decreased  conscious  level,   constricted  pupils  and  hypotension."  In  other  words,  pupils  will  appear  small,  muscles   are  very  weak,  consciousness  is  minimal  (often  coming  in  and  out  of  consciousness),   and  blood  circulation  will  decrease  exponentially.  In  many  cases,  these  signs  of  an   opioid  overdose  result  in  death  (Sandilands  &  Bateman,  2016).  In  addition  to  the   common  causes  and  symptoms,  individuals  who  abuse  opioids  will  become  more   susceptible  over  time.  Users  may  "seek  higher  doses  to  achieve  the  same  desired   effect"  if  they  were  using  opioids  for  the  first  time  (Sandilands  &  Bateman,  2016,  p.  187).   The  opioid  crisis  is  unlike  any  other  contemporary  drug-related  "crisis."  Of  course,   methamphetamines  (i.e.,  crystal  meth)  and  cocaine  (i.e.,  crack  cocaine)  can  result  in   mortality.  Furthermore,  the  "war  on  drugs"  is  ever  present,  with  constant  coverage  of   illegal  smuggling  of  drugs  like  marijuana  and  cocaine.  However,  it  appears  that  the   12     

number  of  casualties  is  a  massive  contrast  to  that  of  the  opioid  crisis.  In  addition,  the   nature  of  the  crisis  is  entirely  different.  For  example,  opioids  are  entirely  legal,   prescribed  by  doctors,  and  mass-produced  by  pharmaceutical  companies  for  profit.     There  are  a  variety  of  approaches  to  manage  the  opioid  crisis.  For  example,   Desapriya  and  Ratnaweera  (2017)  suggest  advertisements  for  prescription  narcotics   should  not  exist  in  medical  journals,  media  campaigns  must  highlight  unclear  or   underdeveloped  research  surrounding  opioids,  physicians  should  have  an  increased   and  improved  online  presence,  physicians  should  promote  alternative  pain  management   techniques,  and  the  current  health  system  must  respond  to  the  ever-changing  opioid   crisis  (Desapriya  &  Ratnaweera,  2017).  However,  from  a  news  media  perspective,  how   do  organizations  cover  the  crisis  adequately  while  staying  true  to  the  suggestions  of   healthcare  professionals?  Like  many  crises,  the  opioid  crisis  is  not  "black  and  white."     Unlike  a  natural  disaster,  the  media  cannot  paint  a  picture  of  the  cause  and   solution.  There  are  a  variety  of  reasons  why  the  opioid  crisis  exists  (i.e.,  racial  bias,   mental  health  stigma,  over  prescription,  and  the  purchasing  power  of  large   pharmaceutical  companies,  to  name  a  few).  Instead,  the  media  must  be  as  objective  as   possible  without  placing  blame.  As  a  result,  this  research  analyses  the  CBC's  attempt  in   communication  this  crisis  with  every  underlying  problem,  preconception,  external   pressure,  and  systemic  issue  working  against  the  conversation.   vii.   Literature  Review   A  comprehensive  and  critical  literature  review  is  described  in  the  following  section.   The  study  of  news  framing  and  narrative  usage  involves  three  areas  of  focus:  crisis   communication  strategy  and  effectiveness  (i.e.,  the  usefulness  and  success  of  a  specific   strategy,  and  the  ability  to  adhere  to  specific  strategies  in  a  crisis  situation),  crisis   13     

communication  applications  and  learnings  (i.e.,  specific  examples  that  demonstrate   crisis  communication  success  or  failure,  and  how  these  examples  apply  to  the  opioid   crisis),  and  lastly,  crisis  and  healthcare  communication  theory  (i.e.,  theoretical   approaches  to  communication  that  are  unique  to  healthcare  crises).     a.   Crisis  Communication  Strategy  &  Effectiveness   Social  media  are  not  the  "principal  tools"  for  crisis  communication  (Roshan,   Warren,  &  Carr,  2016).  Instead,  social  media  are  a  piece  of  the  proverbial  puzzle  that   encompasses  a  crisis  communication  strategy.  To  elaborate  (in  addition  to  the  use  of   social  media),  news  outlets  must  also  consid  er  how  they  communicate  with  their   stakeholders  and  audience.  Communicating  their  brand  and  other  mediums  through   print  media  or  television  advertising,  for  example,  are  of  equal  importance  under  normal   circumstances  (depending  on  a  predetermined  communication  strategy).  However,  only   the  news  outlet  will  determine  which  communication  strategy  works  best  for  their   selected  goals  (i.e.,  engagement,  viewership,  new  media  avenues,  etc.).   Considering  each  available  avenue  for  communication  in  news  media,  social   media  may  not  be  a  priority.  Furthermore,  most  of  the  research  surrounding  the   influence,  usage,  and  relevance  of  social  media  during  a  crisis  is  still  in  its  infancy  (Lin,   Spence,  Sellnow,  &  Lachlan,  2016).  To  theorize  the  appropriate  method  of   communication  during  a  crisis,  Lin,  et  al.,  (2016)  outline  the  dominant  strategies  for  use.   Through  these  strategies,  the  following  research  can  isolate  social  media  as  a  primary   tool  for  crisis  communication  (instead  of  a  piece  to  a  broader  strategy).   For  Lin,  et  al.  (2016),  social  media  strategy  involves  seven  best  practices.  These   practices  include  the  integration  of  social  media  in  decision  making,  the  active   engagement  in  online  dialogue,  the  inclusion  of  credible  information,  the  careful  and   14     

timely  response,  the  creation  of  relevant  hashtags,  the  cooperation  with  similar   organizations,  and  lastly,  the  monitor  of  misinformation.  Lin,  et  al.'s  (2016)  research  aids   the  following  research  in  three  primary  ways.  First,  when  looking  at  the  CBC's  use  of   Twitter  during  the  opioid  crisis,  these  best  practices  work  as  a  framing  tool  for  how  the   outlet  handles  the  crisis.  Second,  these  best  practices  work  as  an  analytical  tool  when   examining  vanity  metrics  (i.e.,  likes,  retweets,  etc.).  For  example,  if  a  tweet  follows  the   strategies  proposed  by  Lin  et  al.  (2016),  did  the  tweet  perform  better  or  worse  (in  terms   of  more  or  fewer  likes  and  retweets)?  Lastly,  the  authors'  research  can  examine  whether   the  CBC  utilized  specific  best  practices  over  time.  As  the  crisis  progresses,  intensifies  or   declines,  the  following  research  must  address  changes  in  strategy.  It  is  important  to   understand  that  different  users  of  social  media  (i.e.,  news  outlets,  public  relation  firms,   organizations,  and  individuals)  have  different  goals  altogether.  However,  by  applying   these  best  practices,  the  research  can  create  an  average  understanding  relevant  to  all   different  areas  of  communication.   To  apply  the  best  practices  explained  by  Lin  et  al.  (2016),  this  research  must   address  the  decisions  leading  to  a  strategy.  Hadi  and  Fleshler's  (2016)  discussion  of   organizational  integration  of  social  media  is  an  essential  lens  of  analysis  when  looking  at   a  specific  social  media  strategy.  The  authors  discuss  the  importance  of  social  media   integration  at  the  organizational  level,  which  is  to  say  social  media  improves  situational   awareness,  to  assess  the  success  or  failure  of  messaging,  and  to  negate  any  notion  of   misinformation  (Hadi  &  Fleshler,  2016).  Using  the  authors'  research,  this  current   analysis  can  assess  the  CBC's  awareness  during  the  opioid  crisis,  the  success  or  failure   of  their  messaging,  and  how  the  CBC  handles  conversation  online  (to  mitigate  rumors,   misinformation  or  reputation).  This  research  will  not  attempt  to  assert  an  opinion  on   15     

whether  the  CBC  attempts  to  hide,  mislead  or  hinder  the  public  through  their  coverage   of  the  opioid  crisis  on  social  media.  Instead,  through  this  lens  of  analysis,  the  research   examines  whether  the  CBC  provides  enough  details  for  updated  stories,  and  to   determine  whether  the  organization  is  competent  in  its  communications  (Koerber,  2017).   So  far,  the  research  will  examine  the  CBC's  social  media  strategy  and  their  ability   to  communicate  the  opioid  crisis  as  an  organization.  However,  to  understand  their   Twitter  posts  and  crisis  response,  the  research  must  also  conduct  a  narrative  analysis.   During  many  crisis  situations,  it  is  natural  for  the  public  to  respond  to  the  assumed  voice   or  political  leaning  of  a  news  source.  As  previously  discussed,  different  motivations  are   omnipresent  (Knobloch-Westerwick,  2017),  this  inevitably  produces  a  narrative  of  a   crisis.  However,  it  is  unclear  whether  the  user  understands  the  narrative.  Also,  it  is   unclear  how  the  chosen  narrative  alters  the  effectiveness  and  reach  of  a  specific  post.   The  phrasing  of  a  social  media  post  may  seem  improvised.  However,  depending   on  the  strategy  of  the  individual,  group  or  organization  under  analysis,  the  construction   of  narrative  is  deliberate.  Because  of  the  multi-factor  nature  of  a  crisis,  strategists  can   structure  a  post  through  multiple  means  like  sympathy,  apology  or  information  (DiStaso,   Vafeiadi,  &  Amaral,  2015).  A  response  may  require  a  specific  narrative  due  to  the   unique  nature  of  the  crisis.  However,  to  promote  a  narrative,  the  party  in  question  may   use  a  specific  narrative  to  manipulate  public  opinion,  sentiment  or  understanding.  For   example,  communicators  such  as  "influential  bloggers  and  tweeters  could  be  used  to   communicate  to  audiences  during  a  crisis"  (George  &  Pratt,  2014,  p.  37).  By  using  these   communicators,  an  organization  may  seem  more  relatable  or  open  to  communications   (instead  of  a  press  release  or  corporate  spokesperson,  for  example),  as  influencers  by   nature  are  intended  to  relate  to  their  social  audience  (Luvaas,  2017).  As  a  result,  the   16     

audience  can  perceive  the  narrative  of  the  organizations  communication  differently.  By   applying  the  strategies  explained  by  DiStaso,  Vafeiadi,  and  Amaral  (2015),  the  research   can  examine  the  decision  to  choose  a  specific  narrative.  Furthermore,  the  research  can   examine  and  analyze  the  content  (i.e.,  text  and  image)  of  the  post.  By  analyzing  the  text   and  imagery  of  the  post  to  determine  the  narrative,  this  research  can  do  the  following:     ·   Examine  how  the  post  relates  to  the  perceived  strategy  of  the  CBC.   ·   Ascertain  which  narratives  are  most  popular  (through  vanity  metric  analysis).   ·   Determine  whether  specific  narratives  were  chosen  due  to  ulterior  motivations  (i.e.,   political  or  social  reasons).   b.   Crisis  Communication  Application  &  Learnings   By  examining  historical  approaches  to  illicit  drug  crises  and  non-illicit  drug  crises   (i.e.,  infectious  diseases  for  example),  this  paper  can  compare  communication   strategies  from  past  events  to  the  current  opioid  crisis.  Furthermore,  this  research  can   explore  why  certain  crises  warrant  specific  framing  strategies  by  news  outlets  as  a  result   of  historical  examples.  For  example,  during  the  Ebola  epidemic  of  2014,  news  outlets   utilized  an  "outbreak"  narrative,  which  defined  the  problem  in  terms  of  a  "primitive  way  of   life"  and  "pandemic  culture"  (Gerlach,  2016).  However,  when  news  outlets  cover  illicit   drug  usage  (i.e.,  heroin,  cocaine,  marijuana,  etc.),  stories  are  often  "hyped"  and  provoke   moral  panics  (Swalve  &  DeFoster,  2016).     By  examining  past  examples  of  crisis  communication,  especially  from  a  narrative   perspective,  we  can  see  that  crises  are  not  as  simple  as  the  issue  itself.  Many  crises   have  hidden  problems  that  extend  from  the  original  issue.  Again,  using  the  Ebola   epidemic  as  an  example,  the  original  crisis  is  the  outbreak,  which  can  lead  to  death.  

17     

However,  hidden  racial,  systemic,  and  socioeconomic  preconceptions  make  the  crisis   exponentially  more  complex.  By  analyzing  these  different  historical  examples,  the   framing  behind  different  types  of  crises  becomes  clearer  and  can  illuminate  how  the   CBC  discusses  the  opioid  crisis  on  Twitter.   Vos  and  Buckner  (2016),  for  example,  use  crisis  and  risk  communication  lenses  to   evaluate  discussion,  response,  and  narrative  on  Twitter  during  the  avian  influenza   outbreak  during  April  of  2013.  The  authors  of  this  research  determined  that  individuals   are  not  entirely  aware  of  their  role  in  the  crisis  itself.  The  public  active  on  social  media   do  not  understand  adequate  control  or  preventative  measures  necessary  during  a  health   crisis  (Vos  &  Buckner,  2016).  According  to  the  authors,  the  public  must  demonstrate  a   certain  amount  of  "sensemaking."  However,  for  the  public  make  sense  of  the  situation,  a   tweet  must  contain  enough  information  to  enable  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  issue.   Appropriate  application  of  crisis  communication  would  include  the  "number  of  those   affected,  the  number  of  deaths,  the  spread  of  the  crisis  (i.e.,  disease  or  addiction),   vaccine  development,  and  the  likelihood  of  transmission"  (Vos  &  Buckner,  2016,  p.  303).   If  there  is  a  misunderstanding  in  this  research  (which  may  lead  to  a  lack  of   sensemaking),  primary  communicators  (i.e.,  the  CBC)  must  adequately  compose   informational  messages  through  social  media,  but  also  interact  with  important   stakeholders  in  the  healthcare  community  to  allow  for  appropriate  information   dissemination.  If  individuals  are  not  equipped  with  the  relevant  information,  much  like   the  case  of  the  influenza  outbreak  of  2013,  how  effective  are  the  communication   strategies  in  place?  For  example,  Vos  and  Buckner  (2016)  found,  "tweets  placed  the   event  in  a  framework  by  dismissing  it  as  media  frenzy"  (Vos  &  Buckner,  2016,  p.  304).   Whether  the  media  overexaggerates  an  issue,  the  lasting  effect  of  information  retention   18     

(or  lack  thereof)  remains.  Furthermore,  does  the  framing  of  the  crisis  result  in  retention   of  information,  or  is  the  CBC  primarily  focused  on  external  motivations?  In  other  words,   regardless  of  the  amount  of  relevant  information  and  involvement  with  stakeholders,   framing  a  crisis  may  result  in  a  miscommunication  of  the  issue.   Returning  to  Swalve  and  DeFoster  (2016),  this  research  will  determine  how  the   CBC  frames  the  opioid  crisis  using  historical  lenses  of  previous  illicit  drug  crises.  Like   non-drug  related  health  crises  (i.e.,  infectious  diseases),  communicators  of  illicit  drug   crises  often  frame  the  problem  in  terms  of  blame  or  fear.  Non-drug  related  health  crises   suffer  from  framing  in  the  same  way  as  illicit  drug  crises.  For  example,  during  the  2003   SARS  outbreak  in  Toronto,  which  claimed  the  lives  of  forty-four  individuals,  a  biased  and   heavily  racialized  narrative  framed  the  crisis.  Often  framed  as  the  "Chinese  disease,"  the   SARS  outbreak  became  synonymous  with  xenophobia  at  the  time  (Seeger,  Sellnow  &   Ulmer,  2008).  Serious  issues  like  the  SARS  outbreak  tend  to  fall  along  racial  or  cultural   divides,  especially  considering  the  extent  that  the  outbreak  claimed  several  lives  and   was  global  in  nature.  However,  the  level  that  bias  (i.e.,  fear,  opinion,  social  difference,   etc.)  occurs  in  non-illicit  drug  crises  varies  drastically  during  illicit  drug  crises.     When  we  look  at  illicit  drugs,  "designer  drugs,"  or  drugs  popularized  in  the  media   (i.e.,  marijuana,  cocaine,  heroin,  ecstasy,  methamphetamines,  etc.),  they  involve   interpretive  cultural  connotations  that  influence  how  we  perceive  the  drug  (Swalve  &   DeFoster,  2016).  In  other  words,  health  crises  involving  illicit  drugs  naturally  lean   towards  framing  bias,  instead  of  regular  disease  discourse.  For  example,  during  an   influenza  outbreak,  the  primary  goal  of  the  crisis  communicator  could  involve   information,  knowledge  translation,  preventative  measures,  and  public  safety.  During  an   illicit  drug  crisis,  the  primary  goal  of  the  crisis  communicator  could  involve  fear,  political   19     

opinion,  moral  justification,  and  stereotypes  of  the  users.  By  comparing  the  narratives  of   non-illicit  drug  crises  and  illicit  drug  crises,  this  research  can  determine  where  the  opioid   crisis  sits  in  terms  of  framing.   c.   Crisis  &  Healthcare  Communication  Theory   The  third  pillar  of  this  Major  Research  Paper  draws  from  two  schools  of  theory:   crisis  communication  and  healthcare  communication.  To  have  a  comprehensive   analysis  of  how  the  CBC  frames  the  opioid  crisis  on  Twitter,  the  addition  of   communication  theory  provides  a  solid  foundation  for  research.  With  tested  hypotheses,   the  research  can  both  build  on  existing  theories  surrounding  framing  and  social  media,   but  also  establish  itself  as  a  unique  frame  of  analysis.  Seeger,  Sellnow,  and  Ulmer   (2008)  provide  an  analysis  of  crisis  communication  within  the  healthcare  field.     The  authors  of  the  book  outline  many  theories  that  aid  in  the  framing  analysis  of   the  opioid  crisis.  More  specifically,  Seeger,  Sellnow,  and  Ulmer  (2008)  use  the  Crisis   and  Emergency  Risk  Communication  (CERC)  framework.  With  supplemental  research   from  Veil,  Reynolds,  Sellnow,  and  Seeger  (2008),  the  CERC  framework  proposes:  (1)   "risk  and  crises  are  equivocal  and  uncertain  conditions  that  create  specific  informational   needs,"  (2)  "two-way  communication  activities  are  necessary  for  the  public  (in  addition  to   agencies  and  stakeholders),"  (3)  "communication  processes  will  change  dramatically  as   a  risk  evolves  into  a  crisis,"  (4)  "risk  and  crisis  communication  are  interrelated  such  that   risk  messages  influence  perceptions,  expectations,  and  behaviour,"  (5)  "communication   is  consequential  to  a  specific  risk  and  crisis  management  outcome  by  promoting  self- efficacy,"  and  (6)  "risk  and  crises  affect  a  wide  variety  of  publics  with  variable  needs,   interests,  and  resources,  which  in  turn  affects  their  communication  capabilities,  needs,   and  activities"  (Veil,  Reynolds,  Sellnow  &  Seeger,  2008,  p.  31).   20     

The  CERC  framework  is  beneficial  in  terms  of  a  theoretical  perspective  and  a   practical  perspective.  As  the  Veil,  et  al.  (2008)  note,  the  CERC  is  a  theory,  but  also  a   useful,  integrated  framework  of  risk  and  crisis  communication  that  also  pushes  the   research  agenda  (Veil,  Reynolds,  Sellnow  &  Seeger,  2008).  At  the  same  time,  by  using   this  specific  theory,  the  following  research  can  address  a  variety  of  practical  examples   through  the  CERC  lens.  Specifically,  the  research  can  address  techniques  and   strategies  used  by  the  CBC,  but  also  shortcomings  and  gaps  in  communication.   Moving  forward  with  the  theoretical  analysis  of  crisis  and  healthcare   communication,  Gesser-Edelsburg,  Shir-Raz,  Walter,  Mordini,  Dimitriou,  and  James   (2015)  provide  research  that  the  previous  literature  does  not  directly  address:  what   stakeholders  are  involved  in  the  public  sphere,  how  does  research  define  a  stakeholder,   and  how  do  stakeholders  affect  the  framing  of  content  (and  therefore  public  perception)?   It  is  important  to  understand  a  stakeholder's  relationship  and  connection  to  a  specific   issue  and  crisis.  However,  the  term  "stakeholder"  is  quite  broad  and  encompasses  a   large  group  of  organizations,  individuals,  and  parties.  By  incorporating  the  research  by   Gesser-Edelsburg,  et  al.  (2015),  the  Major  Research  Paper  can  refer  to  specific  actors,   instead  of  a  broad  organizational  structure.  For  example,  the  role  of  opinion  leaders  (i.e.,   influencers  that  do  not  hold  official  power)  and  stakeholders  (i.e.,  pharmaceutical   regulatory  agencies,  health  ministries,  and  hospitals)  play  an  incredible  role  in   disseminating  information  (Gesser-Edelsburg,  et  al.,  2015).   In  terms  of  framing,  understanding  the  stakeholders  involved  in  the  online   conversation  is  of  utter  importance.  The  following  research  may  conclude  that  no   mention  of  a  stakeholder  exists  in  a  post.  However,  the  content  could  very  well  focus  on   a  specific  stakeholder  without  mentioning  their  name  (i.e.,  based  on  the  timing  of  the   21     

post  relative  to  a  certain  event,  for  example).  Without  knowing  the  primary  stakeholders   in  the  opioid  crisis  conversation,  we  take  the  content  published  from  the  CBC  at  face   value.  By  consuming  information  without  understanding  the  primary  stakeholders,   readers  may  believe  bias  or  a  complete  reframing  of  the  issue.  Readers  may  not   understand  how  internal  or  external  motivations  shape  news  content.  Furthermore,   readers  may  believe  information  that  echoes  prejudice  and  bias,  drawn  from  previous   drug  crises  (i.e.,  crack  cocaine,  methamphetamines,  etc.).   Finally,  we  must  take  a  step  back  and  apply  several  social  media  communication   theories  to  the  broader  issue.  The  following  research  focuses  on  the  framing  of  content   online,  not  social  media  as  a  tool  for  communication.  However,  without  understanding   the  capabilities  of  social  media  (i.e.,  Twitter),  we  cannot  fully  understand  the  reasoning   behind  a  narrative  or  strategy.  Sheldon  (2015)  provides  an  overview  of  social  media   principles  and  applications  relevant  to  a  healthcare  crisis,  but  also  other  related  fields   (i.e.,  politics,  education,  natural  disasters  and  advertising).  By  using  multiple  lenses  of   analysis  in  this  research,  the  MRP  can  appropriately  address  issues  originating  outside   the  opioid  crisis,  but  within  the  social  media  realm.  For  example,  multiple  actors  are   involved  in  the  opioid  crisis  (i.e.,  hospitals,  individuals,  and  governments).  At  the  same   time,  the  crisis  also  creates  various  narratives  of  stigma  and  tokenism.  Without   understanding  how  Twitter,  as  a  platform,  allows  for  the  sharing  of  a  specific  narrative,   we  would  not  be  able  to  address  why  additional  narratives  occur  directly.     viii.   Methodology   a.   Data  Collection   Returning  to  the  primary  research  questions  of  this  Major  Research  Paper,  this   research  address  first,  how  the  CBC  frames  the  issue  of  opioid  usage  in  Canada.  Next,   22     

this  research  addresses  the  nature  of  the  dialogue  occurring  because  of  the  CBC's   Twitter  presence.  More  specifically,  which  CBC  strategies  yield  the  most  response  in   terms  of  vanity  metrics  (i.e.,  likes,  retweets,  and  comments).  Finally,  this  research   discusses  fluctuations  and  outliers  in  news  coverage  by  the  CBC  (directly  due  to  socially   or  politically  driven  events,  for  example).  The  best  method  to  adequately  answer  these   research  questions,  a  quantitative  and  qualitative  analysis  of  116  tweets  was  conducted.   The  sample  involves  tweets  posted  on  the  CBC's  Twitter  account  (@CBCNews)   between  April  1st,  2017  and  April  1st,  2018.   According  to  Moon  and  Hadley  (2014),  "Twitter  has  distinctive  characteristics  that   allow  it  to  function  as  a  more  prominent  partner  for  news  media  than  other  social   networking  sites"  (Moon  &  Hadley,  2014,  p.  289).  The  authors  argue  that  the  retweet   and  hashtag  features  most  prominent  on  Twitter  enable  the  platform  to  "work  like  a   broadcast  medium,"  which  allows  minute-by-minute  coverage  of  events  (Moon  &   Hadley,  2014,  p.  289).  Facebook  has  similar  functionality,  but  the  use  of  hashtags,  for   example,  are  not  as  popular.  Furthermore,  Facebook  may  promote  large-breaking   stories,  whereas  Twitter  may  promote  smaller  "as  it  happens"  content  (with  the   possibility  of  large-breaking  stories  included  as  well).  Because  the  platform  is  built  for   these  purposes,  Twitter  is  the  primary  focus  of  research.  A  comparative  analysis  of   Twitter  content  compared  to  Facebook  content  is  worth  researching  and  would  yield   additional  data  on  the  opioid  discussion.   With  Twitter  as  the  primary  platform  under  analysis,  this  research  examines  tweets   between  April  1st,  2017  and  April  1st,  2018.  This  timeframe  was  chosen  because:  (1)   relevancy  and  (2)  technological  and  platform  changes.  With  regards  to  relevancy,   because  it  spans  more  than  one-year,  it  would  be  difficult  to  paint  a  relevant  picture  of   23     

the  opioid  discussion  if  the  research  included  multiple  years,  for  example.  A  variety  of   events  occurred  that  may  change  the  narrative  of  the  opioid  crisis  (i.e.,  elections,  CBC   staff  changes,  etc.).  Furthermore,  the  way  that  a  community  discusses  opioids  changes   over  time  (i.e.,  word  usage,  slang,  focus,  etc.).  In  addition,  a  one-year  sample  period   ensures  that  the  platform  under  analysis  remains  somewhat  the  same.  In  November  of   2017,  Twitter  officially  doubled  the  character  limit  from  140  characters  to  280  characters.   Simple  platform  changes  like  a  character  limit  increase  can  drastically  alter  the  way  that   the  CBC  communicates  online.  Additional  changes  (i.e.,  algorithm,  organizational,   media  restrictions,  etc.)  are  also  prominent  as  the  time  frame  expands;  this  is  due  to  the   evolving  nature  of  social  media.  As  a  result,  a  12-month  time  frame  is  most  relevant.   To  collect  the  data,  all  116  tweets  were  manually  read  and  transferred  to  Microsoft   Excel.  Most  likely,  there  are  other  methods  to  collect  the  data.  However,  this  method   allowed  a  complete  and  individual  analysis  of  each  tweet  and  each  photo  in  question.   Organizing  the  data  within  the  excel  spreadsheet  was  also  completed  manually.  Most  of   a  tweet's  composition  is  incredibly  crucial  for  analysis.  Therefore,  the  data  collection   considered  all  available  information  from  a  post  itself  (i.e.,  date,  text,  and  vanity  metrics).   As  a  result,  the  research  classifies  certain  aspects  of  the  tweet  into  fourteen  categories:  
·   Keyword   ·   Tweet  Text   ·   Date  Posted   ·   Narrative   ·   Photo  Inclusion  
  

·   Secondary  Narrative   ·   Narrative  Keywords   ·   Secondary  Narrative  Keywords   ·   Likes   ·   Photo  Narrative  

·   Crisis  Acknowledgment   ·   Tweet  Type   ·   Comments   ·   Retweets  

See  "Appendix  A"  for  a  complete  definition  of  each  category.  As  this  research   primarily  focuses  on  the  narrative,  secondary  narrative,  crisis  acknowledgement,  vanity   24     

metrics  (i.e.,  comments,  retweets,  and  likes),  and  photo  narrative,  each  requires   individual  attention  and  definition.   1.   Narrative  &  Secondary  Narrative   According  to  DiStaso,  et  al.  (2015),  "there  is  an  urgent  need  to  study  what  type  of   crisis  response  strategy  is  important  during  an  unfolding  crisis"  (DiStaso,  Vafeiadis,   Amaral,  2015,  p.  222).  Because  of  the  ever-evolving  media  landscape,  there  are  several   different  opportunities  to  communicate  crisis  to  the  public.  Choosing  the  appropriate   medium  to  communicate  is  difficult  to  determine.  Furthermore,  if  the  crisis   communication  response  strategy  is  not  appropriate,  the  medium  will  not  matter.   Although  their  study  primarily  focuses  on  Facebook,  the  authors  discovered  that  the   companies  studied  failed  to  convey  appropriate  situation  responses.  In  other  words,  the   organizations  analyzed  in  their  study  did  not  use  appropriate  language,  nor  did  they   convey  a  narrative  that  elicits  a  productive  crisis  communication  strategy.  This  research   aims  to  ask  similar  questions  to  those  posed  in  the  study  by  DiStaso,  et  al.  (2015).       In  their  study,  DiStaso,  et  al.  (2015)  categorize  the  narrative  strategy  in  terms  of   "apology,"  "sympathy,"  and  "information."  This  framework  is  utilized  in  the  classification   of  possible  CBC  tweet  narratives.  However,  because  the  subject  of  analysis  (the  CBC)   is  different  than  the  subject  in  the  previously  mentioned  study,  additional  categories  are   required.  Furthermore,  because  the  data  collected  uses  a  range  of  narratives,  the   categories  were  not  limited  to  apology,  sympathy  and  information.  Using  a   similar  approach,  this  research  categorizes  the  data  in  "ambiguity,"  "call  to  action,"  "fear   and/or  panic,"  "information,"  "political,"  "sensationalism,"  and  "sympathy"  narratives.     In  addition  to  the  narratives,  for  the  sake  of  this  research  will  be  defined  as   "primary  narratives,"  this  research  also  utilizes  a  "secondary  narrative"  classification.   25     

Each  of  the  classifications  remain  the  same  within  the  narrative  framework.  However,   because  certain  posts  cannot  and  do  not  fit  a  single  classification,  a  secondary  narrative   classifies  the  tweet  as  well.  For  example,  on  March  27th,  2017,  the  CBC  tweeted,  "It  will   soon  be  easier  for  Canadian  doctors  to  prescribe  methadone  and  (pharmaceutical- grade)  heroin"  (CBC  News,  2017)  [4].  This  tweet  is  classified  as  both  sensationalism  and   ambiguity.  The  sensationalism  narrative  is  primary,  as  the  tweet  conveys  the  shocking   idea  that  drugs  will  be  more  readily  available  to  the  every-day  Canadian.  However,  the   ambiguity  narrative  is  secondary,  as  the  tweet  does  not  convey  how  or  why  drugs  will  be   more  readily  available.  For  this  reason,  to  be  more  precise  in  the  following  analysis,  a   secondary  narrative  classification  is  necessary.  The  definition  of  each  classification  are:   ·   Ambiguity:  a  strategic  attempt  to  infer  multiple  meanings,  outcomes  or  stances  on   an  issue  or  event.  This  narrative  strategy  is  purposely  ambiguous  to  entice  the   reader  to  click  through  to  their  website  (see  Figure  1).   ·   Call  to  Action:  encouraging  the  audience  to  elicit  a  specific  response,  the   description  of  an  action  that  caused  an  event,  or  the  strategic  description  of  action   leading  to  a  specific  decision  (see  Figure  2).   ·   Fear  and/or  Panic:  a  narrative  specifically  used  to  incite  fear  or  panic.  These  posts   do  not  provide  in-depth  background,  but  numbers  or  statements  create  an   alarming  and  emotional  response  (see  Figure  3).   ·   Information:  generally,  this  narrative  is  the  assumed  voice  of  an  unbiased  press.   This  narrative  tends  to  remove  any  bias  or  preconception  and  is  strategically  used   to  inform  the  audience  on  the  issue  at  hand  (see  Figure  4).  

26     

·   Political:  a  specific  strategy  to  point  to  a  political  ideology  or  to  cause  strife  towards   a  political  party  or  figure  (see  Figure  5).   ·   Sensationalism:  this  narrative  tends  to  exaggerate  the  issue  or  a  certain  facet  of   the  issue.  Generally,  this  type  of  narrative  intends  to  shock  the  audience  into   reading  further.  This  narrative  is  compared  to  a  tabloid  story  present  in  celebrity  or   popular  culture  (see  Figure  6).   ·   Sympathy:  this  narrative  focuses  on  a  personal  story  or  the  feelings  of  an   individual.  Unlike  the  fear  and/or  panic  narrative,  the  response  this  narrative   primarily  involves  sadness  or  sympathy,  and  attempts  to  relate  to  the  broader   audience  as  if  they  are  experiencing  the  event  themselves  (see  Figure  7).

Crisis  Acknowledgment   Word  usage  can  shift  perception  during  a  crisis  or  newsworthy  event.  Language  

changes  specifically  can  make  the  difference  between  alienating  or  helping  a  vulnerable   demographic.  During  a  health  crisis,  whether  disease  or  drug-related,  appropriately   addressing  realities,  struggles,  and  misconceptions  may  save  lives.  According  to   Collins,  Bluthenthal,  Boyd,  and  McNeil  (2018),  "Calls  for  reframing  how  we  talk  about   substance  use  are  not  new,  with  evidence  underscoring  the  impact  of  discourse  on   reinforcing  stigma  and  undermining  engagement  in  needed  health  and  other  social   services"  (p.  77).  By  using  language  that  promotes  safety  and  works  against  social   stigma,  the  CBC  may  enable  wider  support  for  those  affected  by  the  opioid  crisis,  while  

28     

encouraging  a  "rapid  roll-out  of  life-saving  interventions"  (Collins  et  al.,  2018,  p.  77).  As   a  result,  the  following  research  uses  the  collected  data  sample  and  counts  the  word   frequency  of  terms  like  "crisis,"  "epidemic,"  "catastrophe,"  "dilemma,"  "disaster,"  and   "emergency."  By  collecting  this  data,  this  research  can  determine  whether  the  CBC   plays  a  roll  in  removing  (or  reinforcing)  stigma  and  promoting  life-saving  interventions.   3.   Vanity  Metrics  &  Performance   In  addition  to  the  word  count  for  phrases  like  "crisis,"  and  the  complete  narrative   analysis  of  each  tweet,  this  research  also  catalogs  the  performance  of  each  post   through  vanity  metrics.  As  a  post  in  Twitter  consists  of  three  specific  metrics  (i.e.,   comments,  retweets,  and  likes),  three  categories  were  created  using  Microsoft  Excel.   The  following  research  organizes  the  collected  data  in  terms  of  performance  (i.e.,  most   comments,  most  retweets,  and  most  likes).  Analyzing  vanity  metrics  allows  the  research   to  determine  which  type  of  posts  (with  the  associated  narrative  and  secondary  narrative)   yield  a  more  significant  response  from  the  CBC's  Twitter  audience.  At  the  same  time,   the  research  can  make  inferences  towards  a  deliberate  strategy.  For  example,  if  the   CBC  knows  that  its  users  respond  to  shocking  content,  will  they  continue  to  promote  a   narrative  that  elicits  an  appropriate  response?   b.   Data  Analysis   The  following  research  focuses  on  two  different  methods  of  analysis,  with  both   methods  applied  to  address  the  research  questions.  Primarily,  this  research  conducts  a   discourse  analysis  of  the  opioid  crisis  as  communicated  by  the  CBC's  Twitter  account   (@CBCNews).  However,  the  research  also  conducts  an  attribution  analysis  of  the  opioid   crisis.  Because  the  opioid  crisis  involves  a  variety  of  demographics  and  stakeholders,   this  research  also  considers  whether  the  CBC  attributes  or  blames  the  crisis  on  a   29     

specific  group.  According  to  Morin,  Eibl,  Franklin,  and  Marsh  (2017),  public  opinion  of   opioid  use  in  Ontario,  particularly  within  the  last  decade,  "shifted  from  the  discussion  of   drug  users  as  criminals,  and  addiction  as  a  character  flaw"  (Morin,  Eibl,  Franklin,  and   Marsh,  2017).  This  research  emphasizes  the  parties  and  stakeholders  involved,  and   how  the  CBC  refers  to  them,  to  determine  if  the  authors'  (2017)  claims  are  valid.  In  this   regard,  has  the  public  opinion  of  opioid  use  shifted  from  a  blame-centric  model  towards   problem-solving  model?   c.   Limitations   This  study  experiences  a  series  of  limitations,  primarily  due  to  the  length  of  the   Major  Research  Paper,  resources,  and  time  constraints.  The  primary  limitation  of  this   research  is  the  use  of  NVivo  to  conduct  the  textual  analysis  of  each  social  media  post.   Due  to  technical  issues,  the  research  does  not  make  use  of  the  software  as  a  method  of   analysis.  For  future  research,  the  use  of  NVivo  could  add  an  additional  layer  to  the   understanding  of  each  post  by  the  CBC.   Another  limitation  of  this  research  is  the  lack  of  interviews  with  stakeholders   involved  with  the  CBC's  Twitter  account.  These  stakeholders  include  social  media   managers,  strategists,  external  social  media  specialists,  healthcare  professionals,  and   average  individuals  within  the  CBC's  audience.  By  including  interviews  with  these   stakeholders,  the  research  could  highlight  in  greater  detail  the  meaning,  messaging,  and   purpose  of  the  collected  data.  For  the  sake  of  this  analysis,  interviews  are  not  included.   In  addition,  as  previously  mentioned,  Twitter  doubled  the  character  limit  from  140   characters  to  280  characters  in  November  of  2017.  Because  this  change  occurred  within   the  research  timeframe,  it  is  important  to  note  that  this  research  includes  tweets  with   both  140  and  280-character  limits.  Additional  analysis  can  determine  how  the  narrative   30     

changes  over  time  based  on  the  character  limit  change.  Nevertheless,  this  research   takes  the  same  method  of  analysis  to  understand  the  narrative  of  each  tweet  regardless   of  the  accepted  character  limit.   Although  this  research  analyzes  the  content  of  the  tweet,  it  does  not  mean  that  the   content  of  the  tweet  is  the  same  as  the  headline  of  the  associated  article.  For  future   research,  specifically  involving  a  content  analysis  of  Twitter  posts  by  a  specific  news   outlet,  there  should  exist  a  discussion  on  the  differing  textual  and  narrative  structure   between  tweet  and  article  headline.  Because  individuals  may  only  consume  the  content   of  the  tweet,  they  may  disregard  the  headline  of  the  article.  This  reality  has   consequences  for  information  consumption;  but,  it  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  research.   Lastly,  another  limitation  of  this  research  is  perspective.  Because  this  research   does  not  include  additional  research  methods  (i.e.,  surveys,  focus  groups,  etc.),  the   categorization  of  the  data  is  of  the  author's.  If  additional  ways  existed  to  categorize  the   data  and  analyze  the  photo  narratives,  the  research  could  be  less  subjective.  Of  course,   measures  were  taken  to  be  as  scientific  as  possible  with  the  data.  However,  a  post  that   would  be  considered  "sensationalism"  in  this  research  might  be  "fear  and/or  panic"  to  a   member  of  the  CBC's  audience.  For  this  reason,  the  secondary  narrative  classification   exists  to  be  inclusive  of  alternative  options.  Nevertheless,  due  to  a  lack  of  resources  and   time,  a  more  comprehensive  analysis  is  not  possible.   ix.   Findings  &  Analysis   The  following  paragraphs  discuss  the  findings  relevant  to  the  entire  research.  More   specifically,  the  following  paragraphs  discuss  the  four  primary  focuses  of  analysis:   whether  the  CBC  frames  opioid  usage  as  a  crisis,  which  narratives  are  most   predominant  in  the  opioid  discussion,  which  narratives  performed  best  with  the  CBC's   31     

audience  (through  the  analysis  of  vanity  metrics),  and  lastly,  which  narratives  the  CBC   used  images  associated  with  their  posts.   a.   Avoiding  or  Capitalizing  on  the  "Crisis"  Narrative   Before  examining  the  narrative  of  each  post  from  the  CBC  Twitter  account   (@CBCNews),  one  of  the  primary  focuses  of  this  research  is  to  determine  whether  the   CBC  uses  a  "crisis"  narrative  in  general.  This  question  primarily  relates  back  to  the  first   research  question:  "How  does  the  CBC  frame  the  issue  of  opioid  usage  in  Canada?"  Of   course,  the  analysis  will  become  more  nuanced  in  the  paragraphs  to  follow.  However,  it   is  important  to  look  at  the  narrative  of  the  Twitter  posts  not  only  from  a  refined  and   categorized  perspective  but  also  from  an  overall  "bird's  eye  view"  perspective.  If  the   CBC  does  not  use  the  term  "crisis"  when  referring  to  issues  surrounding  the  opioid   discussion,  the  narrative  becomes  non-crisis  oriented.  As  a  result,  the  social  media   strategy  and  narrative  strategy  will  mimic  a  non-crisis  response.   Of  a  total  116  tweets  from  the  CBC's  Twitter  account,  the  term  "crisis"  appears  26   times.  Therefore,  the  term  "crisis"  does  not  appear  in  the  tweets  90  times.  To  put  these   numbers  into  perspective,  of  the  whole  opioid  discussion  included  in  the  sample,  the   situation  is  referred  to  as  a  "crisis"  only  22.4%  of  the  time.  As  such,  the  situation  is  not   referred  to  as  a  "crisis"  77.6%  of  the  time.  Whether  the  discussion  warrants  the  usage   (or  lack  thereof)  the  term  "crisis"  for  moral  reasons  (i.e.,  the  CBC  has  a  duty  to  frame  the   situation  as  a  crisis)  will  not  be  determined  by  this  research.  However,  in  a  situation   commonly  associated  with  the  terms  "crisis,"  "epidemic,"  "problem,"  and  "emergency,"   the  crisis  narrative  is  non-existent.  When  a  large  portion  of  the  discussion  utilizes  the   terms  mentioned  above,  the  CBC's  exclusion  of  the  terms  is  quite  alarming.  For  the  

32     

sake  of  additional  context,  the  associated  terms  (i.e.,  epidemic,  problem,  and   emergency)  are  included  in  "Appendix  B"  with  full  results.     According  to  Swalve  and  DeFoster  (2016),  "the  mass  media  have  repeatedly  and   cyclically  created  conditions  for  moral  panics  regarding  drug  use,  describing  the  use  of   drugs  such  as  cocaine,  crack,  or  heroine  as  plagues  or  epidemics"  (p.  104).  In  their   analysis,  the  authors  point  out  that  a  so-called  "designer  drug"  narrative  is  promoted   largely  because  of  their  emotional  and  moral  response  from  the  public.  These  designer   drugs,  not  to  be  confused  with  the  "designer  drugs"  that  are  the  controlled  substances   that  mimic  the  effects  of  other  well-known  drugs,  are  typically  high-profile  and  well- known  for  their  prevalence  in  popular  culture  and  their  portrayal  by  the  media.  In  the   case  of  the  opioid  situation,  it  appears  that  because  most  opioids  are  not  "designer   drugs,"  they  do  not  warrant  the  same  communication  strategy  (i.e.,  capitalizing  on  moral   and  emotional  responses).  In  other  words,  because  the  opioid  crisis  does  not  include   the  use  of  drugs  like  cocaine,  crack,  heroin,  marijuana  or  methamphetamines,  the  media   does  not  acknowledge  a  crisis  or  epidemic.   If  the  CBC  does  not  regard  the  current  situation  as  a  crisis,  at  what  point  does  the   situation  evolve  into  a  crisis?  Furthermore,  at  what  point  do  non-designer  drugs  create   enough  traction  to  warrant  an  increased  promotion  from  the  media?  There  are  many   definitions  of  a  "crisis,"  specifically  in  terms  of  crisis  communication.  For  Koerber  (2017),   a  crisis  typically  resembles  as  "a  non-routine,  severe  event  that  could  destroy  an   organization's  or  individual's  reputation  or  operations."  In  addition,  "private  companies   that  respond  poorly  to  a  crisis  may  go  bankrupt,  wiping  out  investments  and  jobs"   (Koerber,  2017,  p.  1).  In  this  sense,  the  author  (2017)  regards  a  crisis  as  something  that   is  primarily  business,  economic  or  corporate-related.  For  the  opioid  crisis,  the  economic   33     

nature  of  the  situation  is  incredibly  interesting.  Unlike  other  drugs  popularized  by  the   media,  opioids  are  entirely  legal  when  prescribed  by  a  doctor.  Furthermore,  opioids  are   lucrative  for  pharmaceutical  companies.  As  the  scope  of  this  research  is  limited,  these   are  questions  for  future  analysis.  However,  because  there  are  many  different  investors,   stakeholders,  and  individuals  involved  in  the  pharmaceutical  industry,  is  the  definition  of   a  crisis  tainted  for  financial  reasons?  If  a  private  company  is  entangled  in  a  scandal  or   crisis-level  situation,  will  the  media  acknowledge  the  opioid  epidemic  as  a  crisis?   Based  purely  on  the  analysis  of  the  116  tweets  issued  by  the  CBC,  a  "crisis"   narrative  does  not  exist.  The  reason  to  avoid  the  term  "crisis"  (and  the  associated  terms)   is  not  apparent,  nor  can  this  research  confirm  the  decision.  Instead  of  outright  stating   that  the  opioid  crisis  exists,  this  research  must  analyze  the  narrative  of  the  sample   tweets.  There  exists  no  definitive  way  to  determine  the  strategy  behind  the  CBC's  social   media  narrative  choice,  other  than  directly  interviewing  staff  members.     Because  communication  through  Twitter  is  quite  limited  (i.e.,  word  count),   communicators  of  all  industries  must  be  concise  and  specific  in  their  word  choice.  In   terms  of  a  narrative  analysis,  the  word  choice  of  a  tweet  carries  a  large  magnitude.  As  a   tweet  only  represents  part  of  a  more  extensive  discussion,  generally  followed  by  an   even  more  extensive  article,  the  content  of  the  tweet  may  be  all  that  a  user  reads.  At  the   same  time,  a  tweet  represents  an  immediate  "snapshot"  of  the  larger  issue.  In  other   words,  a  tweet  can  be  both  abstract  and  incredibly  specific.  The  interpretation  of  the   tweet  can  fluctuate  drastically.  According  to  DiStaso,  Vafeiadis,  and  Amaral  (2014),   "immediate  access  to  information  breeds  the  rapid  dissemination  of  misinformation  that   can  distort  events"  (DiStaso,  Vafeiadis  &  Amaral,  2014).  The  platform  relies  on  the  rapid   dissemination  of  information.  As  a  result,  users  may  only  read  and  analyze  the  text   34     

portion  of  the  tweet  (instead  of  clicking  on  the  associated  article's  link,  for  example).  The   following  paragraphs  illustrate  a  complete  analysis  of  the  CBC's  tweets  in  terms  of   narrative  and  image  rhetoric.   b.   "Pushing"  the  Opioid  Discussion:  Narrative  Findings   Seven  different  narrative  classifications  exist  in  the  analysis  of  the  CBC's  Twitter   account  (@CBCNews).  The  classifications  are:  "ambiguity,"  "call  to  action,"  "fear  and/or   panic,"  "information,"  "political,"  "sensationalism,"  and  "sympathy."  The  analysis  of   CBC's  Twitter  account  also  includes  an  additional  "secondary  narrative"  categorization.   Each  secondary  narrative  classification  is  the  same  as  the  primary  narrative   categorization.  Instead,  the  secondary  narrative  does  not  control  the  larger  (primary)   narrative  of  the  post.  Furthermore,  the  classifications  remain  the  same  for  the  secondary   narrative  (with  a  variety  of  posts  lacking  a  secondary  narrative  entirely).  The  results  of   the  narrative  analysis  are  as  follows:

Based  on  the  data  above  and  the  sample  collected  from  the  CBC's  Twitter  

account,  there  is  an  overwhelming  "information"  narrative.  In  fact,  the  "information"   narrative  is  larger  than  the  second  and  third  most  prevalent  narratives  combined.   However,  as  previously  discussed,  the  way  that  an  audience  perceives  the  narrative  of  a   tweet  can  vary  quite  drastically.  In  this  regard,  the  secondary  narrative  becomes   essential  in  illuminating  the  bigger  picture  of  the  opioid  discussion.  In  certain   circumstances,  the  audience  may  perceive  the  primary  narrative  immediately.   Alternatively,  the  audience  may  perceive  the  secondary  narrative  immediately.  Because   Twitter  posts  are  quite  limited  in  scope,  subjectivity  is  quite  apparent.  Without  additional   research,  through  a  survey  for  example,  it  is  impossible  to  determine  how  an  individual   perceives  a  narrative.  The  secondary  narrative  helps  mitigate  these  concerns.  Only  a   total  of  87  out  of  the  entire  116  posts  offer  a  secondary  narrative:

The  research  can  determine  that  from  the  data,  the  CBC's  primary  narrative   motivations  are  to  inform  the  audience.  With  most  online  news  sources,  as  information   is  increasingly  available,  and  the  potential  for  bias  is  high,  objectivity  is  always  a   question  (Ruggerio,  2004).  In  this  case,  the  CBC  at  least  attempts  to  provide  information   in  a  manner  that  is  useful  and  beneficial  to  its  audience.  The  data  overwhelmingly   supports  that  the  narratives  associated  with  the  opioid  discussion  are  intended  to  inform,   instead  of  provoking  or  confusing.  However,  the  secondary  narratives  associated  with   each  post  are  quite  alarming.   With  the  majority  of  the  posts  falling  under  the  "information"  narrative,  a  majority  of   secondary  narratives  fall  under  the  "ambiguity"  narrative.  In  other  words,  although  the   CBC  promotes  a  generally  unbiased  perspective  of  the  opioid  crisis,  their  posts  could   generate  a  large  amount  of  confusion.  Instead  of  simply  painting  a  picture  of  the  opioid   discussion,  the  CBC  relies  on  confusion  to  encourage  clicks  (i.e.,  directing  their   audience  from  Twitter  to  their  main  website).  Through  this  understanding,  the   "information"  narrative  becomes  more  about  providing  information  with  the  potential  to   mislead  than  providing  information  to  help  the  audience  understand  the  situation.  In   other  words,  providing  intentionally  confusing  content  may  lead  to  additional  clicks.   Nevertheless,  the  research  can  conclude  that  the  CBC's  Twitter  strategy  generally   focuses  on  providing  the  audience  with  relevant  information,  instead  of  provoking  fear.

When  discussing  healthcare-related  crises,  provoking  fear  and  panic  (for  example)  is  an   easy  route  to  take,  as  it  generates  continued  readership.     c.   Buying  the  Opioid  Discussion:  Vanity  Metrics   Although  vanity  metrics  are  critical  indicators  of  how  well  a  post  performed,  they   are  not  a  complete  measure  of  success  or  failure  for  a  few  reasons.  First,  vanity  metrics   are  a  representation  of  how  the  CBC's  immediate  audience  reacted  to  the  content.  In   some  cases,  an  extended  network  may  see  specific  posts  (i.e.,  due  to  retweets).   However,  vanity  metrics  only  represent  a  portion  of  the  population  that  saw  the  tweet.   Generalizations  about  the  broader  public  can  exist,  but  they  are  not  certain.  Second,   only  the  administrators  of  the  CBC  News  account  can  see  the  full  analytics  of  a  tweet   (i.e.,  impressions,  link  clicks,  and  detail  expands).  The  vanity  metrics  may  not   adequately  represent  the  population,  because  additional  hidden  metrics  are  not   available  to  the  public.  Lastly,  the  audience  may  click  "like"  or  "retweet"  without  reading   the  content.  Regardless,  analyzing  vanity  metrics  provides  the  most  available  data  on   performance  while  also  considering  narrative.   Regarding  comments,  the  top  five  posts  have  a  primarily  "political"  narrative  (a   total  of  four)  with  the  additional  post  categorized  as  "information."  Please  refer  to   "Appendix  C"  for  complete  results.  In  this  case,  it  appears  that  the  CBC's  audience  is   increasingly  willing  to  comment  on  politically-driven  content.  According  to  Xenos,   Vromen,  and  Loader  (2013),  the  increasing  engagement  with  political  content  is  not  an   implausible  concept.  In  fact,  a  variety  of  studies  show  that  audiences  on  social  media   positively  respond  to  the  ability  to  engage  in  a  civic  discussion  online.  Furthermore,   political  opinions  tend  to  vary  quite  drastically,  which  creates  a  platform  to  vocalize   opinion  (by  physically  writing  thoughts  in  the  comment  section)  (Xenos,  Vromen  &   38     

Loader,  2013).  However,  this  research  must  note  that  people  who  are  likely  to  engage  in   political  discussion  may  likely  do  so,  even  without  the  use  of  social  media.  The  sample   may  not  represent  an  entire  population,  rather  those  that  are  already  involved  in  politics.   Nevertheless,  the  "political"  narrative  generates  the  most  substantial  amount  of  opinion   on  the  CBC's  Twitter  page.  If  the  CBC  decided  discussion  and  direct  text  engagement  is   important  to  their  strategy,  they  might  send  a  politically-driven  post  to  their  audience.  In   this  case,  it  will  elicit  a  broader  conversation  on  their  page.     Regarding  retweets,  the  top  five  posts  appear  entirely  different  from  the  comment   metrics.  In  this  case,  one  post  is  categorized  as  "sympathy,"  two  posts  are  categorized   as  "sensationalism,"  and  two  posts  are  categorized  as  "information."  Please  refer  to   "Appendix  D"  for  complete  results.  Because  these  findings  are  quite  general,  this   research  speculates  that  the  CBC's  audience  does  not  intend  to  directly  share  content   of  other  categorizations  (i.e.,  call  to  action,  political  or  ambiguity).  These  results  could   mean  the  CBC's  audience:  relates  to  the  "sympathy"  narrative,  finds  the   "sensationalism"  narrative  shocking  (which  would  warrant  sharing  with  friends),  or  finds   the  "information"  narrative  useful  or  interesting  enough  to  share  as  well.  However,  when   looking  at  the  next  highest  retweets,  the  following  four  include  two  "fear  and/or  panic"   and  two  "sensationalism"  narrative  posts.  As  a  result,  these  narratives  may  result  in  a   more  visceral  or  emotional  response,  which  would  encourage  the  audience  to  retweet   the  content  to  their  audience.   Finally,  in  terms  of  likes,  the  narrative  categorizations  look  like  the  retweet  metrics.   In  this  case,  three  posts  are  categorized  as  "information,"  one  post  is  categorized  as   "sympathy,"  and  one  post  is  categorized  as  "sensationalism."  Much  like  the  retweet   metrics,  the  findings  are  quite  general.  However,  expanding  the  number  of  analyzed   39     

posts  (i.e.,  including  an  additional  six),  the  research  finds  that  the  following  tweets   include  four  "information"  narrative  posts,  one  "sensationalism"  narrative  post,  and  one   "political"  narrative  post.  In  other  words,  the  CBC's  audience  may  relate  most  to  posts   that  do  not  push  a  motive  or  agenda.  The  "information"  narrative,  as  previously   mentioned,  tends  only  to  promote  facts,  numbers  or  figures  related  to  the  opioid   discussion.  Instead  of  trying  to  evoke  anger  or  conflict,  these  types  of  posts  directly   provide  additional  background  to  the  discussion.  Based  on  the  number  of  likes,  it   appears  that  the  audience  responds  (and  understands)  when  the  CBC  remains   unbiased  and  objective.   d.   Image  Rhetoric  Analysis   From  a  purely  visual  perspective,  most  of  a  tweet's  composition  is  the  image   associated  with  the  content.  The  platform  allows  280  characters,  an  increase  from  the   previous  140  characters.  Although  280  characters  may  seem  like  a  small  amount  of  text   to  convey  a  complicated  topic  like  the  opioid  crisis,  the  Twitter  platform,  a  mini  blog,   thrives  on  this  model.  Because  character  length  is  limited,  Twitter  encourages  more   concise  and  direct  statements.  In  addition,  users  can  include  additional  customization  to   their  post  through  images  without  subtracting  from  the  overall  character  count.     If  a  post  includes  an  image,  the  image  can  make  up  anywhere  between  50-75%  of   the  tweet  itself  (visually).  The  presence  of  an  image  is  essential  for  many  reasons.  For   example,  if  a  regular  reader  of  the  CBC's  Twitter  feed  primarily  assesses  the  worth  of  a   post  based  on  the  existence  of  a  visual,  they  may  be  inclined  to  read  or  engage  (i.e.,   like,  share  or  retweet)  with  the  article.  In  addition,  the  image  can  frame  the  text  and  the   interpretation  of  the  tweet.  As  a  result,  the  visual  may  determine  the  overall  success  of   the  post,  measured  explicitly  by  vanity  metrics.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  Twitter  post   40     

includes  an  image  that  is  controversial,  shocking,  informative  or  geared  towards  a   specific  stakeholder,  users  may  or  may  not  engage  with  the  content  based  on  the   intended  audience.  Because  something  as  simple  as  an  image  can  shape  the   performance  of  a  post,  this  research  must  analyze  image  usage  in  the  tweet  sample.   To  provide  an  adequate  analysis  of  the  photos  associated  with  each  Twitter  post,   this  research  categorizes  the  photos  into  ten  separate  categories  (person,  drug,   prescription  drug,  drug  user,  political,  miscellaneous,  authority  figure,  N/A,  information,   and  death).  Specific  categories  have  subcategories  to  allow  for  further  clarification.  For   the  sake  of  this  research,  it  is  important  to  distinguish  "person"  from  "drug  user"  and   "prescription  drug"  from  "drug."  By  no  means  does  research  suggest  drug  users  are  not   people.  Instead,  the  strategic  photo  usage  of  a  drug  user  is  important  to  distinguish.   Images  including  drug  users  are  often  quite  graphic  and  evoke  a  more  visceral  and   emotional  response  (see  Figure  8,  for  example).  Images  of  individuals,  on  the  other   hand,  are  not  as  emotionally  evoking  (see  Figure  9,  for  example).  If  the  CBC  intended  to   engage  users  strategically  or  to  catch  the  eye  with  an  image  that  is  more  visually   shocking,  they  might  use  an  image  of  a  drug  user  (instead  of  a  safe  injection  site,  for   example).  Because  they  speak  to  different  audiences,  events,  and  severities  of  an   issue,  the  categories  require  differentiation.

Figure  9.  Example  of  the  "Person"  classification  

Defining  "prescription  drug"  and  "drug"  is  also  vital  for  the  sake  of  this  discussion.   Much  like  the  previous  distinction  of  a  person  from  a  drug  user,  a  prescription  drug   photo  compared  to  a  drug  photo  could  yield  different  results  in  performance  and   narrative.  Prescription  drugs  may  yield  a  minor  emotional  response;  they  may  seem   scientific  or  related  to  the  advice  of  a  doctor  in  times  of  illness.  Drug  photos,  on  the  other   hand,  have  the  potential  to  yield  a  more  visceral  response  (much  like  the  drug  user   photo  classification).  For  example,  Figure  10  represents  the  "prescription  drug"   classification.  Most  people  are  aware  of  prescription  drugs  and  their  appearance.  With   the  drug  classification,  on  the  other  hand,  images  may  appear  more  shocking  for  those   not  versed  with  the  subject  matter.  In  this  case,  the  CBC  may  use  a  drug  image  to  shock   the  audience.  Refer  to  Figure  11  for  an  example  of  the  "drug  classification."

Figure  11.  Example  of  the  "Drug"  classification  

Out  of  a  total  116  tweets  from  the  CBC's  Twitter  account,  only  a  total  of  4  posts  did   not  contain  a  primary  image  (i.e.,  a  photo  attributed  to  the  linked  article  or  even  a   thumbnail  image  that  previews  an  embedded  video).  For  the  posts  that  included  an   image,  the  most  common  classifications  were,  in  order:  (1)  Person,  (2)  Drug,  (3)  

42     

Prescription  Drug,  (4)  Drug  User,  and  (5)  Political.  For  complete  results,  including  the   frequency,  please  refer  to  "Appendix  F."   The  results  begin  to  construct  an  overall  image  of  the  CBC's  framing  and  narrative   strategy,  explicitly  using  strategic  imagery.  The  most  common  classification,  the   "person"  classification,  shows  that  the  CBC  aims  to  personalize  the  issue.  Of  course,  the   content  of  the  article  will  decide  the  choice  of  imagery.  If  the  primary  narrative  of  the   CBC's  content  involves  a  person,  individual  or  a  personal  story,  the  image  will  reflect  a   person.  However,  the  fact  that  the  "person"  classification  is  most  prevalent  speaks  to  the   intended  narrative  of  the  overall  content,  without  directly  reading  the  accompanying   articles  first.  Because  the  account  predominantly  uses  the  "person"  classification,  the   CBC  may  suggest  that  the  opioid  crisis  is  an  issue  for  everyone.  Using  this  type  of   imagery  evokes  a  feeling  of  relatability,  possibly  drawing  on  personal  emotions.     Furthermore,  although  the  main  usage  of  "person"  imagery  involves  adults,  most  of   which  have  unknown  identities  without  reading  further  into  the  article,  the  CBC  creates   an  implied  narrative  of  those  affected  (or  possibly  affected)  by  the  opioid  crisis.  Instead   of  predominantly  using  photos  of  children,  celebrities  or  those  who  appear  below  the   poverty  line,  the  CBC  implies  that  the  opioid  crisis  is  an  issue  for  adults  in  general.   Without  context,  the  CBC  leaves  the  reader  to  infer  the  type  of  person  most  likely  to   suffer  from  an  opioid  addiction.  With  any  situation,  descriptions  and  definitions  should   lead  in  the  direction  to  concrete  facts  (i.e.,  to  limit  confusion,  bias,  and  blame).   Of  course,  an  image  alone  cannot  speak  to  those  affected  by  the  opioid  crisis,   mainly  because  the  crisis  spans  multiple  demographics.  To  capture  an  individual  dealing   with  mental  illness  (for  example)  or  living  in  a  particular  neighbourhood  is  difficult  to   capture  in  a  photo.  Also,  obtaining  photos  of  individuals  within  a  specific  demographic  or   43     

cluster  is  quite  difficult.  At  the  same  time,  obtaining  these  photos  would  infringe  on  the   privacy  of  those  affected,  while  being  morally  and  ethically  questionable.  In  the  end,   however,  the  strategic  use  of  adults  in  the  photo  may  regard  the  CBC's  readership  to   appear  more  relatable.  Without  further  research  (i.e.,  interviews  with  the  social  media   team),  this  assumption  is  unknown.   ix.        Discussion   As  previously  mentioned,  this  research  intends  to  address  how  the  CBC  frames   the  issue  of  opioid  usage,  primarily  in  Canada.  Because  of  their  framing  usage,  this   research  also  addresses  how  the  audience  responds  to  specific  content.  By   understanding  narrative  usage,  the  CBC's  Twitter  can  paint  a  broader  picture  of  the   opioid  discussion.  In  addition  to  the  narrative  analysis,  the  following  paragraphs  assess   how  successful  the  CBC's  strategy  was  in  terms  of  crisis  communication  (i.e.,  using  both   theoretical  and  hands-on  practices),  and  how  the  CBC's  Twitter  posts  fit  within   traditional  understandings  of  crisis  communication  theory.  By  understanding  how  the   CBC  communicates,  we  can  hold  other  news  outlets  to  similar  standards.  In  addition,  we   can  understand  the  narratives  of  opioid  use  that  Canadians  are  participating  in  (i.e.,  as   opposed  to  only  viewing).  In  the  following  paragraphs,  the  research  directly  relates  the   most  relevant  communications  literature  to  the  findings  mentioned  above.   a.   Best  Practices:  Social  Media  Crisis  Communication   As  previously  mentioned,  Lin  et  al.  (2016)  believe  best  practices  in  social  media   improve  professional  practice  during  times  of  crisis.  As  the  authors  describe,  crises  are,   by  definition,  novel,  unpredictable,  and  require  deliberate  and  immediate  responses  (Lin,   Spence,  Sellnow  &  Lachlan,  2016).  Because  our  methods  of  communication  are   increasingly  digital,  social  media  plays  an  incredibly  important  role  in  communicating   44     

crisis.  However,  if  managed  inadequately,  news  outlets  run  the  risk  of  providing   incorrect  or  delayed  messages.  Similarly,  the  public  engages  in  the  conversation,  which   requires  all  organizations  communicating  the  crisis  to  respond  immediately.     In  "Crisis  Communication,  Learning  and  Responding:  Best  Practices  in  Social   Media,"  Lin  et  al.  (2016)  provide  an  in-depth  framework  for  social  media  communication   during  a  crisis.  The  authors'  "best  practices"  apply  to  a  variety  of  fields,  ultimately   applying  to  healthcare  crises  and  the  opioid  discussion  as  well.  As  a  result,  this  research   incorporates  each  best  practice  in  the  following  paragraphs.  However,  because  this   research  focuses  on  a  news  outlet,  an  additional  layer  of  analysis  is  required.  Because  a   news  outlet  does  not  work  in  the  same  capacity  as  a  regular  organization,  this  research   also  discusses  whether  news  outlets  should  be  held  to  the  same  level  of  accountability.   The  first  best  practice  that  this  research  must  evaluate  is  "actively  engaging  in   dialogue  online."  The  authors  suggest  that  organizations  should  engage  with   stakeholder  concerns  using  hashtags  and  direct  responses,  for  example.  By  doing  so,   organizations  avoid  a  "one-way"  stream  of  communication  that  does  not  facilitate  a   conversation  (Lin,  Spence,  Sellnow  &  Lachlan,  2016).  In  this  regard,  the  CBC  does  not   utilize  this  best  practice.  In  the  entire  data  set,  only  two  tweets  utilized  a  hashtag  (i.e.,   #Opinion,  #BCElxn17,  and  #BCVotes).  Furthermore,  the  CBC  Twitter  account  does  not   directly  tweet  to  individuals;  rather  it  is  to  relay  their  news  content  to  its  audience.  In  this   sense,  communication  is  one-way.   The  next  best  practice  that  is  increasingly  relevant  to  this  research  is  the  "use  of   media  affordances  to  provide  credible  sources  of  information  (Lin,  Spence,  Sellnow  &   Lachlan,  2016,  p.  602).  As  one  of  the  most  trusted  news  sources  in  Canada,  the  CBC   does  utilize  this  best  practice  on  social  media.  Often  citing  information  from  the   45     

authorities,  mayors,  premiers,  the  RCMP,  health  officials,  and  a  variety  of  ministries,   their  content  shows  reliability  through  their  sources.  However,  as  a  disseminator  of  crisis   information,  the  CBC  does  not  share  content  from  outside  their  network.  As  a  news   outlet,  not  sharing  external  content  is  likely  an  attempt  to  remain  unbiased.  However,  a   lack  of  illuminating  the  issue  from  a  variety  of  perspectives  does  not  aid  the  discussion.   The  next  best  practice  is  of  the  most  important  for  appropriate  social  media  use   during  a  crisis.  Specifically,  this  best  practice  involves  the  timeliness  of  responses  and   updates.  This  best  practice  directly  addresses  the  research  question,  "How  are   fluctuations  and  outliers  in  news  coverage  accounted  for  by  the  CBC?  Are  socially   and/or  politically  driven  events  the  cause  for  timely  posts?"  Based  on  the  graph  below,   we  can  see  that  timeliness  generally  remains  the  same.  However,  months  like  May  of   2017  and  October  of  2017  stand  out  the  most.

Figure  12.  Number  of  Twitter  Posts  per  Month  

In  May,  a  variety  of  events  occurred  that  account  for  the  fluctuation  in   communication.  The  first  significant  outlier  is  political;  at  the  end  of  May,  Health  Minister,   Jane  Philpott  ordered  a  review  of  opioid  guidelines  due  to  a  conflict  of  interest.   According  to  the  Globe  and  Mail,  the  Health  Minister  wanted  to  review  the  standards  for   prescribing  opioids,  as  many  doctors  had  ties  to  the  opioid  industry  (Globe  and  Mail,   46     

2017).  As  a  result,  the  CBC  posted  about  this  issue  in  six  separate  tweets  (which  is   around  the  average  post  amount  for  other  months).  The  next  significant  outlier  is  also   political;  on  May  9,  2017,  British  Columbia  held  a  general  election.  As  a  result,  the  CBC   tweeted  four  separate  times  surrounding  election  issues  (i.e.,  First  Nations  issues  and   other  province's  policies).  Lastly,  May  saw  a  variety  of  studies  and  breaking  news   stories  within  the  opioid  discussion.  For  example,  the  CBC  posted  about  increases  in   opioid  usage,  large  legal  settlements,  legal  cases,  and  medical  developments  (i.e.,  new   treatments  or  potentially  fatal  drugs).   In  October,  we  see  a  similar  picture  by  the  content  of  the  tweets  published  by  the   CBC.  Most  tweets  published  in  October  are  also  political.  However,  the  data  suggest   that  the  CBC  increased  the  opioid  discussion  for  two  reasons:  an  increase  of  opioid- related  deaths  and  a  response  to  US  President  Donald  Trump.  Regarding  opioid-related   deaths,  we  encounter  tweets  like,  "The  number  of  babies  born  with  an  opioid   dependency  is  rising"  (CBC  News,  2017)  [8]  and  "As  opioid  overdoses  spike,  Ottawa   health  workers  try  giving  addicts  `clean  drugs'"  (CBC  News,  2017)  [3].  In  this  sense,  the   CBC  responds  to  an  increased  threat,  much  like  one  would  during  a  crisis.  As   developments  occur,  the  public  should  receive  additional  information.  On  the  other   hand,  we  encounter  tweets  like,  "NDP  pushes  Liberals  to  follow  Trump,  declare  opioid   crisis  a  national  public  health  emergency"  (CBC  News,  2017)  [6].  In  this  sense,  we  can   see  how  the  United  States  influences  Canada,  especially  with  the  opioid  discussion.   Based  on  the  information  provided  in  the  previous  paragraph,  we  can  determine   that  the  CBC  responds  to  developments  in  the  opioid  discussion.  However,  the   response  to  newsworthy  events  does  not  necessarily  mean  a  timely  response.  Although   the  CBC  remains  quite  average  throughout  the  months,  the  question  remains  as  to   47     

whether  timeliness  exists  overall.  Are  these  posts  enough  to  effectively  communicate  a   crisis?  After  all,  communicating  timely  information  to  the  public  is  a  fundamental  function   of  crisis  communication  (Kim,  2015).   If  we  were  to  analyze  this  situation  as  the  "opioid  crisis,"  it  must  meet  the  criteria   that  would  deem  the  situation  a  crisis.  The  terms  "crisis,"  "disaster,"  and  "emergency"   are  quite  broad  in  their  definition.  According  to  the  World  Health  Organization,  these   terms  can  mean  the  following:  "Its  greatest  value  is  that  it  implies  the  possibility  of  an   insidious  process  that  cannot  be  defined  in  time,  and  that  even  spatially  can  recognize   different  layers/levels  of  intensity."  At  the  same  time,  these  terms  can  mean  "the   occurrence  in  a  community  or  region  of  cases  of  an  illness,  specific  health-related   behaviour,  or  other  health-related  events  clearly  in  excess  of  normal  expectancy"  (World   Health  Organization,  2018).  A  variety  of  situations  classified  as  a  "crisis"  result  in  a  large   response  on  social  media  (i.e.,  natural  disasters,  corporate  scandals,  and  disease   outbreaks),  which  resemble  the  definitions  mentioned  above.  Instead,  the  opioid   discussion  retains  a  serious  disconnect  which  undermines  the  intensity  of  the  situation.   As  a  result,  we  see  the  CBC  posting  about  the  opioid  "crisis"  only  a  few  times  each   month,  whereas  a  more  obvious  crisis  would  warrant  the  same  amount  of  posts  in  a   single  day.  In  this  regard,  the  CBC  is  not  timely  in  their  social  media  strategy  and   coverage  of  the  opioid  crisis.   The  final  best  practice  this  research  looks  at  is  "cooperation  with  the  public  and   similar  organizations."  According  to  Lin  et  al.  (2016),  the  nature  of  social  media  can   "allow  not  only  the  government  and  media  to  work  together,  but  brings  the  public  into  the   conversation"  (Lin,  Spence,  Sellnow  &  Lachlan,  2016,  p.  604).  When  the  public   audience  looks  to  social  media  to  collect  their  news,  social  media  plays  a  vital  role  in  the   48     

sense  that  the  public  can  return  communication.  In  terms  of  crisis  communication,  the   ability  to  respond  and  open  the  lines  of  communication  could  potentially  save  lives.   However,  the  case  of  the  CBC,  the  @CBCNews  Twitter  account  does  not  mention   external  organizations,  nor  does  the  account  directly  interact  with  individuals.  With  that   said,  the  CBC  does  not  function  in  the  same  way  as  an  organization  like  the  Red  Cross.   The  public  looks  to  the  Red  Cross  as  an  "on  the  ground"  organization.  Ready  to   help  at  a  moments  notice,  these  humanitarian  organizations  work  alongside  local  and   national  stakeholders.  In  this  case,  it  is  natural  to  work  with  and  mention  external   organizations  for  the  sake  of  managing  crisis  (Koerber,  2017).  News  outlets  like  the   CBC,  on  the  other  hand,  are  not  held  accountable  or  to  the  same  standards  to  mitigate  a   crisis.  Instead,  the  public  looks  to  the  CBC  to  merely  communicate  crisis.  However,   could  the  opioid  crisis  benefit  from  additional  resources,  like  the  CBC  mentioning  certain   organizations  or  linking  directly  to  government  Twitter  accounts?     Arguably,  individuals  could  gain  additional  information  from  directly  linked  sources.   In  this  regard,  cooperating,  communicating  and  integrating  efforts  with  similar   organizations  would  benefit  the  crisis  conversation.  The  CBC  is  incredibly  adamant   when  mentioning  the  involved  parties  (i.e.,  governments,  cities,  drug  companies,  etc.).   However,  the  intent  of  mentioning  the  involved  parties  is  to  inform,  not  to  redirect  the   conversation.  The  CBC  does  not  link  the  content  in  the  Twitter  post  to  additional   information,  nor  do  they  engage  with  the  public  in  the  comment  section  of  each  post.  As   a  result,  the  CBC  does  not  utilize  this  best  practice  to  its  full  potential.   b.   Assessing  the  Success  of  the  CBC's  Efforts   Successful  crisis  communication  is  difficult  to  measure.  As  they  are  not  confined  to   one  sector,  organization,  or  type  (i.e.,  natural  disaster,  corporate,  healthcare,  etc.),   49     

crises  vary  in  structure  and  magnitude.  Because  of  the  ever-changing  nature  of  crises,   we  can  gauge  the  usefulness  of  the  strategy,  much  like  the  topics  discussed  in  the   previous  paragraph.  In  addition,  research  by  Hadi  and  Fleshler  (2016)  suggests  that  the   level  of  integration  of  social  media  in  a  crisis  situation  demonstrates  the  success  of  crisis   communication  efforts  as  well.  Using  the  authors  (2016)  research,  three  specific  areas   of  integration  will  assess  the  success  and  usefulness  of  the  CBC's  communication   strategy  when  discussing  the  opioid  crisis:  the  level  of  situational  awareness,  the   success  of  the  messaging,  and  the  management  of  misinformation.   When  assessing  situational  awareness,  which  Hadi  and  Fleshler  (2016)  define  as,   "having  a  mechanism  in  place  to  ensure  relevant,  timely,  and  accurate  social  media   information  is  gathered  and  shared"  (Hadi  &  Fleshler,  2016).  This  measure  of  success  is   similar  to  the  timeliness  "best  practice"  by  Lin  et  al.  (2016).  However,  situational   awareness  goes  a  step  further  to  assess  whether  the  information  is  correct  during  a   crisis.  For  example,  Hadi  and  Fleshler  (2016)  use  the  example  of  the  New  York  City   Ebola  outbreak  of  2014  stating,  "news  organizations  began  reporting  the  name  of  the   patient  and  inaccurately  reporting  his  actions  the  day  before  hospitalization"  (Hadi  &   Fleshler,  2016).  In  this  regard,  the  CBC  fares  well  when  discussing  factual  evidence.   From  the  data  collected,  the  CBC  do  not  accuse  or  assume  the  fault  of  an  organization   or  individual.  Instead,  like  a  trustworthy  news  source,  the  CBC  states  the  facts  based.   These  facts  are  from  scientific  studies  or  government  officials,  which  ensures  a  high- level  of  accountability.  In  terms  of  communicating  factual  information,  the  CBC  is  useful.   However,  Hadi  and  Fleshler  (2016)  also  suggest  that  successful  crisis   communication  involves  the  management  of  misinformation.  Because  Twitter  is  entirely   in  the  hands  of  the  profile  manager,  determining  the  method  of  handling  misinformation   50     

is  difficult  from  a  research  perspective.  As  the  scope  of  this  research  is  limited,  there  is   no  method  to  determine  whether  the  CBC  deletes  incorrect  information  or  whether  they   replace  the  tweet  with  the  correct  information.  The  only  way  to  understand  the  news   outlet's  management  of  a  lack  of  in-depth  information  is  through  posts  that  are  tagged   as  an  "update"  or  those  that  refer  to  a  previous  study.  From  the  collected  data,  the  CBC   has  not  posted  an  update  to  a  story  or  study,  nor  have  they  directly  acknowledged  an   error  in  communication.  Instead,  the  CBC  promotes  breaking  content,  primarily  new   studies  involving  opioid  usage  or  opioid-related  deaths.  In  other  words,  there  is  no   causal  linkage  between  each  post  to  determine  if  any  misinformation  was  mitigated.   Furthermore,  if  the  account  provides  a  development  on  an  issue,  situation,  or  study,  the   narrative  tends  to  be  profoundly  political  or  involve  the  legal  case  of  a  drug  company.     In  a  successful  scenario,  the  CBC  could  promote  the  temporal  changes  of  the   opioid  crisis  (i.e.,  amount  of  safe  injection  sites  opening  over  time,  amount  of   prescription  drugs  sold  legally,  amount  of  overdoses  over  time,  etc.).  Instead,  there  is  a   lack  of  accountability  for  previous  developments.  For  example,  the  CBC  notes,  "2,000%   rise  in  street  drug  samples  testing  positive  for  fentanyl"  [2]  (CBC  News,  2017).  There  are   a  variety  of  questions  that  are  unanswered  from  this  information:  What  defines  positive   testing?  A  2,000%  rise  from  what  level  previously?  Which  drug  does  the  study  include?   Unfortunately,  the  questions  are  endless.  As  a  result,  the  research  determines  that  the   CBC  lack  a  level  of  monitoring  misinformation,  at  least  to  the  extent  that  a  timeline  does   not  exist  to  confirm  developments  or  changes  in  the  crisis.   Finally,  the  research  must  assess  the  success  or  failure  of  public  messaging.   Fortunately,  the  CBC  excels  in  tailor-made,  professional,  and  coherent  content.  As  one   of  the  leading  news  sources  in  Canada,  the  CBC  holds  itself  to  a  high-standard  of  story- 51     

telling  and  social  media  production  (i.e.,  non-laborious  text,  correct  grammar,  a  non- distracting  graphic,  etc.).  Because  this  research  focuses  on  two  primary  frames  of   analysis,  narrative,  and  crisis,  the  CBC's  quality  content  must  also  apply  to  these  areas.   Hadi  and  Fleshler  (2016)  write,  "inevitably,  regardless  of  how  well  written  the  message,   there  will  be  no  further  questions  and  potentially  confusion"  (Hadi  &  Fleshler,  2016,  p.   776).  If  we  looked  at  a  crisis  like  the  Johnson  and  Johnson's  Tylenol  scandal  of  1980,   we  can  see  how  accurate,  timely,  and  unambiguous  information  can  result  in  effective   crisis  communication  (Olaniran,  Scholl,  Williams  &  Boyer,  2012).   This  health-related  crisis,  not  dissimilar  to  the  opioid  crisis  in  many  ways  (i.e.,   unknown  effects  of  ingestible  medicine),  received  praise  for  how  the  communicators   acted.  Of  course,  Johnson  and  Johnson's  failed  crisis  communication  during  the  2008   Motrin  scandal  is  another  story.  Nevertheless,  the  organization  received  praise  as,  "the   goal  of  public  health  is  to  educate  the  public,  control  the  outbreak  of  illness  and   infection,  maintain  and  monitor  standards,  and  inform  the  public  of  threats  to  health  and   safety"  (Olaniran,  et  al.,  2012).  The  CBC,  in  this  case,  absolutely  provides  the  public   with  an  ample  amount  of  information  and  public  threats.  However,  the  main  issue  with   the  CBC's  method  of  crisis  communication  is  that  it  does  not  provide  a  solution  or  a   place  to  turn  for  those  involved  in  the  crisis.  As  the  data  suggests,  a  major  secondary   narrative  is  "ambiguity."  Because  of  a  significant  amount  of  ambiguity,  the  CBC  does  not   provide  successful  public  messaging.  With  the  impact  of  a  particular  narrative  in  mind,   we  must  move  forward  to  the  discussion  of  the  narratives  used  by  the  CBC.   c.   Popular  Narratives  &  Unintended  Consequences   The  primary  and  underlying  focus  of  this  research  regards  the  narrative   surrounding  the  opioid  crisis.  Because  social  media  are  not  only  challenging  the   52     

landscape  of  communication  but  also  how  individuals  consume  information,  the   narrative  used  in  crisis  communication  is  incredibly  important.  If  used  correctly,  crisis   communication  narratives  can  avoid  potentially  catastrophic  outcomes.  If  used   incorrectly,  crisis  communication  narratives  can  result  in  harm  towards  a  specific  group   (i.e.,  social  stigma),  incorrect  information  resulting  in  physical  harm,  and  even  the   prolonging  of  the  crisis  itself.  Based  on  the  data  collected,  the  following  paragraphs   discuss  the  successes,  failures,  and  possible  outcomes  of  the  CBC's  narrative  usage.   Understanding  the  narrative  used  by  a  news  outlet  or  organization  can  illuminate   true  intentions.  Returning  to  Swalve  and  DeFoster  (2016),  if  an  outlet  decides  to  induce   a  moral  panic,  they  could  do  so,  resulting  in  tension  between  a  variety  of  groups  (i.e.,   racial,  socioeconomic,  and  political)  (Swalve  &  DeFoster,  2016).  The  CBC  does  not   attempt  to  induce  a  moral  panic  to  leverage  existing  misconceptions  of  certain   demographics.  In  a  world  rampant  with  news  sources  aligning  to  ends  of  the  political   spectrum,  it  is  possible  to  find  several  narratives  on  the  same  issue.  The  CBC  takes  the   moral  route  and  objectively  focuses  on  the  statistics.  At  the  same  time,  the  "ambiguity"   narrative  behind  each  post  does  not  lead  the  discussion  in  a  productive  direction.   The  narrative  of  the  opioid  crisis  is  not  only  important  in  itself,  but  also  how  it  fits   within  the  crisis  timeline.  According  to  the  Gerlach  (2016),  "news  coverage  of  disease   outbreaks  has  developed  into  a  standard  story  format  involving  three  general  stages:   sounding  the  alarm,  mixed  messages,  and  crisis  and  containment"  (Gerlach,  2016).   During  the  Ebola  outbreak  of  2014,  major  news  outlets  fell  into  this  story-telling  method.   However,  when  reporting  the  "crisis  and  containment"  stage,  news  outlets  shifted  from   containment  to  aggressive  action  (i.e.,  promoting  large-scale  military  missions,  the  

53     

building  of  clinics,  and  the  training  of  local  peoples)  (Gerlach,  2016).  Why,  in  the  case  of   the  opioid  crisis,  does  the  CBC  remain  in  a  state  of  inaction?   Where  the  Ebola  outbreak  incorporated  a  "pandemic  narrative,"  the  opioid  crisis   incorporates  a  narrative  of  what  can  only  be  described  as  confusion.  As  previously   discussed,  the  primary  narrative  present  in  posts  by  the  CBC  is  "information."  At  the   same  time,  a  large  amount  of  posts  with  the  secondary  narrative  "ambiguity"  are   present.  Due  to  this  narrative  combination,  the  CBC's  crisis  timeline  varies  between   "sounding  the  alarm"  and  "mixed  messages."  Instead  of  moving  forward  in  the  crisis   timeline  as  one  would  expect,  inaction  results  in  the  CBC  not  pushing  the  discussion   further.  This  research  does  not  suggest  that  the  CBC  is  at  fault  for  not  pushing  the   discussion,  but  due  to  external  forces  (i.e.,  stigma,  a  lack  of  understanding,  vulnerable   populations,  etc.),  the  crisis  communication  process  is  incredibly  elongated.   Because  the  timeline  is  not  pushed  to  the  "crisis  and  containment"  stage,  the   narratives  encourage  a  repetitive  trajectory.  In  other  words,  the  CBC  promotes   information  that  "sounds  the  alarm"  on  an  issue  within  the  opioid  discussion.  Next,  the   CBC  promotes  information  that  continues  the  discussion,  but  does  not  provide  any   means  to  move  forward,  encourage  action  or  provide  an  understanding  of  the  issue.  As   a  result,  the  only  way  to  move  forward  with  the  discussion  is  to  "sound  the  alarm"  on   another  aspect  of  the  crisis  (therefore  returning  back  to  the  beginning  of  the  process).   For  example,  the  CBC  posted,  "Federal  health  minister  orders  independent  review  of   opioid  guidelines  after  conflict-of-interest  controversy"  (CBC  News,  2017)  [5].  This  tweet   sounds  the  alarm  that  a  development  happened  within  the  crisis.  The  same  day,  the   CBC  posted,  "Opioid  conflict-of-interest  controversy  reveals  extent  of  big  pharma's  ties   to  doctors"  (CBC  News,  2017)  [7].  This  tweet  provides  a  mixed  message,  as  it  begins  to   54     

question  who  may  be  at  fault  for  a  portion  of  the  crisis.  However,  where  the  next  stage   would  generally  turn  into  "crisis  containment,"  the  CBC  does  not  continue  on  with  the   story  afterwards.  As  a  result,  the  conversation  never  finds  resolution.      It  is  important  to  remember  that  if  there  are  no  developments  in  the  opioid  

discussion  (i.e.,  within  the  conflict-of-interest  story,  for  example),  there  is  no  need  to   continue  down  the  crisis  timeline.  News  outlets  should,  in  theory,  report  on  topics   objectively.  To  remain  objective,  the  outlet  should  not  exploit  a  situation  for  the  sake  of   making  a  story.  In  the  CBC's  case,  they  do  an  exemplary  job  as  the  primary  narrative  is   not  "fear  and/or  panic"  or  "sensationalism."  However,  by  avoiding  the  progression  of  the   conversation  of  opioid  usage  (i.e.,  following  up  on  a  certain  story  or  statistic),  the  CBC   (alongside  other  news  outlets)  run  the  risk  of  further  stigmatizing  the  issue.  Although  the   primary  narrative  is  not  "fear  and/or  panic"  or  "sensationalism,"  the  secondary  narrative   does  contain  a  decent  amount  of  "ambiguity"  and  "sensationalism."  As  a  result,  the   reader  may  jump  to  a  conclusion  due  to  the  CBC's  strategy  to  push  a  specific  narrative.   In  defense  of  the  CBC's  narrative  strategy,  they  do  not  directly  promote  stigma  or   bias  towards  a  specific  group.  The  CBC  is  quite  objective  in  promoting  statistics  that   affect  all  Canadians,  regardless  of  status.  However,  social  media  creates  the  affordance   to  interact  with  a  large  majority  of  audiences,  like  those  affected  by  the  opioid  crisis.   Social  media  also  allows  the  ability  to  remain  anonymous,  which  protects  the  vulnerable   populations  involved.  In  other  words,  organizations  and  news  outlets  have  the  ability  to   help  communicate  a  crisis  ethically,  inclusively,  and  systematically.  But,  the  CBC  simply   does  not  use  the  affordances  of  social  media  to  its  full  potential.  In  most  healthcare  or   health-related  crises,  individuals  often  characterize  (a)  the  person  with  the  disease  as   responsible,  (b)  the  disease  is  incurable,  (c)  the  disease  as  not  well  understood,  and  (d)   55     

that  the  symptoms  cannot  be  concealed  (Boudewyns,  Himelboim,  Hansen  &  Southwell,   2015).  Because  the  CBC  does  not  use  a  narrative  that  promotes  the  betterment  of  those   affected  by  the  crisis,  the  crisis  remains  stigmatized.  The  CBC  is  by  no  means   responsible  to  reshape  or  destigmatize  the  opioid  crisis.  However,  if  truly  productive   dialogue  should  arise  from  highlighting  the  opioid  crisis,  efforts  could  exist  lead   conversation  productively  and  usefully.  An  overabundance  of  information  posts  ensure   that  the  conversation  is  known  to  the  public.  At  the  same  time,  this  overabundance  of   information  ensures  the  audience  cannot  utilize  the  content  provided.   What  if  an  additional  narrative  classified  as  "rehabilitation"  existed?  Posts  with   these  narratives  may  examine  the  realities  of  the  opioid  crisis  and  provide  a  quantifiable   solution.  Even  if  the  solution  is  theoretical  or  in  the  process  of  gaining  scientific   credibility,  the  post  may  provide  useful  information  to  those  who  need  it  most.  At  this   point,  the  narrative  used  by  the  CBC  creates  the  "opi-void"  crisis.  Again,  the  mandate  of   the  CBC  is  not  to  rehabilitate  those  affected  by  the  opioid  crisis.  However,  as  a  news   organization,  they  can  absolutely  amplify  stories  about  topics  that  can  rehabilitate  those   affected  by  the  opioid  crisis.  Instead,  narratives  surrounding  elections,  law  suits,  profit   cuts,  and  crimes  remain  ever  present.  Of  course,  certain  posts  do  exist  that  warn  of  the   dangers  associated  with  opioids  (i.e.,  mixing  with  alcohol  or  other  medications).   However,  the  majority  of  posts  do  not  follow  this  trend.   d.   The  Opioid  Discussion  &  Theoretical  Frameworks   By  now,  the  multi-faceted  nature  of  the  opioid  crisis  is  obvious.  The  sheer  number   of  stakeholders  involved  compounded  with  a  non-linear  timeline  makes  the  crisis   incredibly  difficult  to  understand  and  communicate.  For  these  reasons,  this  research   must  apply  an  appropriate  theoretical  lens  to  fully  understand  the  crisis  in  question.  As   56     

previously  mentioned,  the  Crisis  and  Emergency  Risk  Communication  (CERC)   framework  is  useful  when  looking  at  the  opioid  discussion  from  a  theoretical  lens.     What  makes  the  CERC  framework  interesting,  and  different  from  other   classification  models  of  crisis,  is  that  there  is  a  systematic  approach  to  the  crisis.  Instead   of  a  theory  like  Situational  Crisis  Communication  Theory  (SCCT)  that  suggests  a  crisis   response  should  match  the  level  of  severity  (Coombs,  2004),  the  CERC  framework   requires  an  ongoing  communication  progress  that  responds  to  the  different  stages  of   crisis  (i.e.,  pre-crisis,  initial  event,  maintenance,  resolution,  and  evaluation)  (Veil,   Reynolds,  Sellnow  &  Seeger,  2008).  Furthermore,  the  CERC  framework  requires  the   merging  of  risk  and  crisis.  Instead  of  simply  responding  to  a  crisis,  the  CERC  framework   encourages  the  communication  of  risk  conjointly  or  before  the  crisis  occurs.   For  the  opioid  crisis,  this  framework  is  an  incredibly  useful  tool  for  analysis.   Because  the  opioid  crisis  is  unique  (i.e.,  different  stakeholders  and  non-linear),  both   crisis  lenses  and  risk  lenses  apply.  In  terms  of  Veil,  Reynolds,  Sellnow,  and  Seeger's   (2008)  claims,  one  of  the  most  important  aspects  of  the  CERC  framework  is  that  "risk   messages  communicated  before  a  crisis  occurs  influence  perceptions,  expectations  and   behaviours"  (Veil,  Reynolds,  Sellnow  &  Seeger,  2008).  One  of  the  major  shortcomings   of  the  CBC's  crisis  communication  strategy  is  that  the  information  is  quite  short-sighted.   The  CBC's  posts  explain  a  snapshot  of  the  situation  (i.e.,  results  of  a  study),  while  not   predicting  how  the  crisis  will  progress.  As  the  CERC  framework's  fundamental  idea   surrounds  an  evolving  communication  strategy  as  the  problem  progresses,  the  CBC   falls  short.  For  example,  the  CBC  posted,  "1  in  5  opioid-related  deaths  in  Ontario  involve   alcohol,  study  suggests"  [1]  (CBC  News,  2017).  The  onus  is  not  on  the  CBC  to  place   blame  or  direct  the  conversation  a  certain  way.  However,  there  is  no  merging  of  risk  and   57     

crisis  information.  Instead,  the  CBC  could  post,  "1  in  5  opioid-related  deaths  in  Ontario   involve  alcohol,  study  suggests.  If  using  prescription  medication,  avoid  alcohol   consumption,  as  liver  damage  is  increased."  Of  course,  this  suggestion  is  quite   rudimentary.  However,  combining  both  risk  and  crisis  makes  the  information   manageable  and  useful  to  the  public.   An  additional  aspect  of  the  CERC  framework  involves  "acknowledging  the  wide   variety  of  publics  with  variable  needs,  interests,  and  resources"  (Veil,  Reynolds,  Sellnow   &  Seeger,  2008).  Again,  the  opioid  crisis  is  an  interesting  case  study  for  this  framework,   as  a  large  amount  of  the  public  may  not  exist  online,  while  also  belonging  vulnerable   groups.  Analyzing  the  opioid  crisis  in  this  manner  highlights  the  importance  of  narrative   usage  by  the  CBC.  If  the  CERC  framework  establishes  the  understanding  that  risk   levels  are  uneven  across  diverse  populations  (Veil,  Reynolds,  Sellnow  &  Seeger,  2008),   the  communication  efforts  should  mimic  this  reality.  The  CBC  tends  to  create  content  for   their  audience,  not  the  affected  audiences.  A  large  majority  of  their  tweets  outline  the   difficulties,  risks,  and  realities  associated  with  opioid  usage.  However,  their  narrative   tends  to  favour  their  own  audience.  Because  this  research  is  limited,  it  cannot  determine   the  CBC's  core  Twitter  audience  (in  terms  of  age,  demographic,  race,  gender,  etc.).   Regardless  of  the  available  data,  the  CBC  could  publish  content  that  is  of  use  to  the   affected  demographics  (i.e.,  where  safe  injection  sites  are,  which  medications  do  not   mix,  etc.).  Because  of  the  cooperative  and  communal  nature  of  social  media,  those   affected  may  learn  the  risks  associated  with  opioid  usage  if  shared  by  someone  within   the  CBC's  audience  (even  if  the  affected  party  is  outside  of  the  CBC's  audience).   x.   Conclusion  

58     

In  conclusion,  the  opioid  crisis  lacks  significant  discussion  by  the  CBC.  While  the   news  outlet  does  a  commendable  job  by  promoting  information  that  illuminates  the   realities  of  the  crisis  (i.e.,  statistics),  the  CBC  does  not  provide  adequate  information   with  (a)  what  to  do  with  the  information  and  (b)  how  to  feel  about  the  information.  Each   individual  post  has  a  primary  narrative,  while  many  posts  have  a  secondary  narrative.   Whether  the  CBC  intended  an  individual  post  to  use  a  particular  narrative  is  beyond  this   research.  However,  the  data  suggests  that  an  overwhelming  "information"  focused   narrative,  with  a  majority  of  secondary  narratives  contain  an  "ambiguity"  or  "political"   narrative.  The  use  of  these  narratives  have  implications  for  the  larger  discussion.   The  CBC  most  definitely  frames  the  issue  of  opioid  crisis.  The  posts  are  framed  in  a   specific  way  with  the  intention  to  inform  to  public,  which  is  not  abnormal  for  news  outlets   during  a  crisis.  At  the  same  time,  we  see  a  varied  response  to  the  narratives  by  the   public.  Future  research  could  conduct  a  study  as  to  why  the  CBC's  audience  responds   (i.e.,  likes,  comments,  and  retweets)  to  a  certain  narrative.  In  the  meantime,  this   research  can  conclude  that  audiences  respond  (i.e.,  comment)  to  political  content,  while   sharing  sad  or  sympathetic  content.  By  understanding  the  reality  that  certain  narratives   yield  a  certain  response,  which  the  CBC  would  most  definitely  understand,  the  overall   narrative  runs  the  risk  of  manipulation  towards  a  certain  end  goal.   In  terms  of  the  information  conveyed,  as  this  narrative  is  most  prevalent,  the  CBC   may  intend  for  the  audience  to  be  informed  with  current  affairs  surrounding  the  opioid   crisis.  A  primary  area  that  the  CBC  falls  short  is  how  the  information  helps  the  audience   (whether  they  are  involved  with  the  opioid  crisis).  It  is  useful  to  conclude  that  the  CBC's   primary  narrative  is  "information."  However,  additional  research  must  examine  the   usefulness  of  the  information.  Whether  the  CBC  provides  statistics,  news  stories  of   59     

arrests  or  large  financial  figures,  there  must  be  an  increased  effort  to  utilize  this   information  meaningfully.   Finally,  the  CBC  does  promote  content  surrounding  the  opioid  crisis  quite  regularly.   As  previously  mentioned,  there  are  a  few  outliers  that  increase  the  discussion,  which   involve  political  events,  legal  developments,  or  research  studies.  But,  generally   speaking,  the  crisis  communication  surrounding  the  opioid  crisis  is  quite  even.  Normally,   communicating  the  crisis  regularly  would  benefit  the  overall  discussion.  By  posting  about   the  crisis  around  the  same  amount  each  month,  the  visibility  of  the  issue  is  around  the   same  year-round.  Moving  forward,  the  CBC  could  post  more  content  each  month  to   ensure  that  the  regular  content  increases  visibility  year-round.  Additional  studies  could   illuminate  the  amount  of  crisis-related  tweets  for  another  issue  compared  to  this  crisis.  It   does  seem,  however,  that  this  conversation  does  not  warrant  as  much  discussion  as  a   more  seemingly  imminent  crisis  (i.e.,  disease,  illness  or  outbreak).   But,  at  the  end  of  the  discussion,  we  must  acknowledge  that  social  media  are  only   one  part  of  the  crisis  communication  process.  Especially  when  understanding  how  the   CBC  communicates  crisis,  280  characters  cannot  fully  represent  the  entire  conversation.   Attached  to  each  tweet  are  articles  written  by  incredibly  talented  journalists  and  videos   that  encompass  much  more  than  a  single  tweet.  Furthermore,  larger  discussions  occur   on  other  media  (i.e.,  television,  podcasts,  YouTube,  newspapers,  etc.).  These  additional   mediums  allow  for  a  larger  discussion.  However,  when  audiences  are  increasingly   turning  to  social  media  for  their  main  source  of  news,  what  is  said  in  280  characters  can   represent  an  entire  crisis.  Without  acknowledging  this  reality,  narratives  will  continue  to   speak  larger  than  the  tweet  itself.  The  narrative  will  also  underpin  the  entire   conversation,  lasting  longer  than  the  duration  of  the  tweet  in  any  single  newsfeed.   60
