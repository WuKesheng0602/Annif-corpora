THEATRE HISTORY
Originally known as the Pantages Theatre, the historic Ed Mirvish Theatre was built to showcase vaudeville and motion pictures. When it opened in 1920 by Famous Players, it was the largest theater in Canada with a capacity of 3,373 seats. The original design of the building is accredited to the notable theatre designer Thomas W. Lamb. After the manager, Alexander Pantages, was involved in a rape case, management of the establishment was turned over to Famous Players and it was re-named the Imperial, now only showing movies. In 1972, the Imperial was divided into 6 cinemas by Mendel Sprachman, a Toronto Architect. The main space was turned into 5 different cinemas with the 6th under the stage, costing a total of $2,000,000. This configuration was economically valid, but the Imperial closed in 1986 when Famous Players stopped all operations due to lease difficulties. Half the lot was leased to Famous Players, who leased the north half of the building to Cineplex Odeon. After a long conflict between the two companies, Famous Players agreed to sell the Yonge entrance to Cineplex Odeon on the condition that no movies could be showed at the theatre. Following the purchase, Garth Dabrinski of Cineplex Odeon decided to restore the theatre to its original design. The restoration, costing $18,000,000, started by taking out the partitions and restoring the paints and finishes, with original drawings and photos being used as reference. As the theatre was initially for film and vaudeville, the restorations also involved re-allocating space and reinforcing the foundation to accommodate more extensive stage performances. The theatre accommodated 2200 seats, and became managed Cineplex Odeon's live performance theatre division, Livent. The first legitimate live performance show to play on the stage was the 1989 production of the Phantom of the Opera by Andrew Lloyd Webber, which played at the location for over 10 years. In 1999, Livent went bankrupt and the theatre was sold to LiveNation, who owned the Ed Mirvish Theatre Company. It was re-named the Canon Theater after Canon sponsored the location. When LiveNation was purchased by Key Brand, part of the purchase agreement was that Key Brand would sell the theatre to Panasonic, who allowed Ed Mirvish to successfully bid for ownership of the theatre and lease in 2008. In 2011, it was finally renamed the Ed Mirvish Theatre.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
Initially built for vaudeville, the acoustics of the Ed Mirvish Theatre was appropriately suited for live performances following its reconstruction. Thomas Lamb designed a hardtop theatre with a dome in the ceiling and a galleria to increase seats without compromising sight lines. Although he considered sight lines and acoustics, Lamb's primary concern was on the decorative aesthetic of the building. As a result, the establishment has several aspects inherent in its design that lead to mediocre acoustic performance. The most prominent interior finish of the theater was plaster. The flat surfaces of the interior have poor acoustic performance; however, the heavily plastered finish of the interior was crafted and molded into ornamentation which helps with scattering. The presence of the galleria level fascia also helps with scattering. Lamb's decision to include a large dome over the theatre also compromises the acoustic performance of the space. It prevents early reflections as well as causes concentrated reflections. To compensate for the less than ideal acoustics of the space, acoustical fabrics were integrated into the interior as curtains and finishes in an attempt to prevent undesired reflections. The performers are generally outfitted with microphones and an extensive sound system was integrated into the building to help compensate for the acoustic performance. A significant consequence of the renovations was the integration of updated mechanical and HVAC systems into the building. These systems had to be run around the theatre and surrounded in significant sound control techniques including insulation and sounddampening finishes.

ELGIN THEATRE
CITY: ADDRESS: ACOUSTICS CONSULTANT: ARCHITECT: OWNER: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: RESTORATION DATE: RESTORATION COST: Toronto, Ontario 189 Yonge Street Robert Tanner Thomas W. Lamb Marcus Loew (now Ontario Heritage Trust) $500,000 1913 1989 $29,000,000 (for Elgin and Winter Garden)

THEATRE HISTORY
The Elgin Theatre is an embodiment of the theatre industry in Toronto. Its grandeur is a mark of the success of the theatre during its construction, while its loss illustrates the decline of the industry in the 50's. Its preservation, however, is a mark of the enduring value of the theatre in today's society. Originally named Loew's Yonge Street Theatre, the Elgin Theatre is one of the two commissioned by American financier Marcus Loew. Marcus Loew operated several theatres in New York City, including his corporate headquarters, the American Theatre, a double-decker theatre complex on the 42nd Street. This same model of stacked theatres was developed for their Canadian Flagship. The complex includes the Elgin Theatre at the bottom, the smaller Winter Garden Theatre above. The complex was designed by Thomas W. Lamb, a renowned architect from New York City, morely known for his theatre projects. Following the trend of theatre as a "movie palace" of the time, the Elgin theatre was designed in a classic style. It is lavishly decorated in Edwardian colours, with imitation marble and red brocade, featuring pilasters and murals, altogether resembling a European Palace. The $500,000 project opened eight months after construction on December 1913. With a seating capacity of 2,149 persons, along with the Winter Garden, the theatre complex became host to entertainment in Toronto. The two theatres were intended to tender the same shows, including a combination of short movies and a series of vaudeville acts. A shift in the entertainment industry initiated the decline of the theatre complex. Vaudeville acts were prevalent throughout the 1920's until its popularity was replaced by movies. The theatre complex failed to adapt to the shift, and The Winter Garden was first to be closed in 1928, while the Elgin Theatre continued to operate as it featured a new medium of entertainment, sound movies. The theatre featured blockbuster movies of the time. To continue to adapt to the changes in the industry, in 1960, the Elgin was converted into a Cinerama. This development included three projectors and an expansive curved screen, demanding for a large space. The installation required for the removal of the theatre's proscenium arch and opera boxes, weakening its grand appearance and reducing its seating capacity to 1,562 patrons. However, despite the development, the complex failed to maintain its prominence. In the late 70's, it began to feature thirdrate movies, and eventually adult movies. As property values in the downtown core escalated, the theatre complex was once again threatened to face closure, but instead, it was purchased by the government of Ontario to be restored to its original condition. The $29,000,000 restoration was completed in two years and the theatre reopened in 1989. This development allowed the preservation of the historic theatre, while adapting it for the current demands of the city. The Loew's Yonge Street's character and history is remarkable and worthy of preservation. The theatre complex remains as the only operating doubledecker theatre in the world, a running mark in the entertainment history.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
Built in the 1900s, the interior of the Elgin Theatre is lavishly decorated. These decorations have great influences on the acoustics of the theatre. Sound is reflected off balcony fronts, boxes, coves, the dome and rounded corners. The tapestry, drapery, seat upholstery and carpet are made with sound absorptive fabrics. Undesirable sound wave reflections are broken up by arches, coffered niches, ornamental grille, heavy stucco, relief decoration and the audiences themselves. Despite the acoustical aids from the interior decorations, the Elgin Theatre suffers some acoustical problems such as low reverberation time, insufficient lateral energy and excessive initial time delay. The theatre balcony's low ceiling is a contributor to the short reverberation time and high intelligibility. At certain places the ceiling is as low as 3.3 m. With the hall empty, the reverberation time above the balcony is around 1 second at mid frequencies. To address these problems, Robert Tanner and David Griesinger developed a system that would improve the acoustics of the Elgin Theatre without changing the appearances of the theatre. The electroacoustic system seeks to supply higher lateral energy and increase the reverberation level and time under the balcony. The problem of speaker placement, microphone placement, and acoustic feedback thus become essential to the system. The ultimate solution is an electroacoustic enhancement system called LARES that will augment the acoustics of the theatre. 120 loudspeakers are recessed into the two ceilings. Two LARES processors are used to give 8 output channels, which runs 16 reverberators and allows internal mixing. The 120 loudspeaker is arranged into 8 banks of interleaved pattern, with the 8 output channels directed to each bank. Sound is received and processed through the output channels and then sent to the speakers. The dense ceiling arrays of speakers provided adequate lateral energy. The need to install speakers on the side walls is thus avoided, which fulfills the goal of minimally alternating the look of the theatre. Microphones are placed close to the stage with independent control of reverberation time and level. There are also microphones attached to the balcony rail 15m from the stage which can pick up sound from the stage with good uniformity. Efforts are being made to hide the microphones from the visibility of the audiences. The result of the system was considered beyond expectation. Acoustical improvement is particularly apparent below the balcony. Equal sound distribution in all directions is achieved through the uniform array of loudspeakers, where audiences are not able to detect the specific location of speakers. Sound level and lateral sound energy also increases. Above the balcony the system is able to reproduce reverberations times that is appropriate to the specific performances. Reverberation times and levels can now be adjusted at any time with a controller.

FLECK DANCE THEATRE
CITY: ADDRESS: ACOUSTICS CONSULTANT: ARCHITECT: OWNER: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: Toronto, Ontario 207 Queens Quay West Artec Inc Zeidler Roberts Harbourfront Centre $4,000,000 1983

THEATRE HISTORY
The Queen's Quay Terminal formerly known as Terminal Warehouse, opened in 1927 at a cost of $3,000,000. It was the first poured concrete building in Canada, designed in 1926 by Moores and Dunford from New York City. As one of the largest buildings in Canada at the time, it was a cold storage facility for the port, where the railroad network would transport goods from. When the automobile took over from the train as the most used means of transporting goods, the building fell into disrepair and was left empty until 1983. In 1972, the Federal Government made a crown corporation in order to help renew 100 acres of the harbourfront from York Street to Stadium Road. Harbourfront centre was therefore developed in order to rejuvenate the Toronto waterfront through entertainment, learning, and cultural activities. The theatre was specifically designed as a dance theatre to continue the proclivity of contemporary dance in Toronto's Harbourfront. The redevelopment of the Queen's Quay Terminal was done by Olympia and York Developments Ltd. Eberhard Zeidler of Zeidler Partnership and transformed the Terminal Warehouse into a shopping, office and cultural centre that helped to revitalize the waterfront of Toronto. The Premiere Dance Theatre was opened officially on the 24th of September 1983, with financing from Olympia and York Developments Ltd., the Ministry of Culture (Province of Ontario), and the Government of Canada. Later, the Department of Canadian Heritage and the City of Toronto financially supported a renovation project to improve the interior finishes and acoustic properties. The theatre also sported a new name, The Fleck Dance Theatre, which is derived from Harbourfront Centre arts patrons Margaret and Jim Fleck. As part of Harbourfront Centre, The Fleck Dance Theatre helps to enliven the community with its cultural events. The dance theatre is next door to other Harbourfront Centre cultural centres such as the Power Plant Contemporary Art Gallery and the Enwave Theatre, and the community centre which provides workshops for woodworking, glass-making, fabric-work and other fields.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
Specifically designed for performance of contemporary dance, the Fleck Dance Theatre has a seating capacity of 450 persons. The seating is arranged on two steeply-raked tiers, and therefore has an intimate environment for performances. The theatre accommodates film, drama, chamber music, and mime presentations, recitals, chamber orchestras, and jazz groups. However, the space is used frequently by the Canadian Broadcasting Company for broadcasts and recordings. The acoustics of the space is amplified using an Audient AZTEC mixing console, including 24 mono inputs, 8 stereo inputs, 8 Aux outputs, 2 stereo aux outputs, 8 subgroup outputs, 12 VCA subgroups, 12 x 8 matrix, midi message output and dedicated recorder interfaces. Due to the fact that the Fleck Dance Theatre is located within another building the theatre is very well insulated to protect from unwanted sounds. 700 mm double walls with batt insulation are used in this theatre. Drop ceilings with acoustic panels, moveable ceiling curtains, cushioned seats, carpeted floors, and curtains at the rear of house in orchestra and balcony in the boxes to the left and right are used to absorb sound propagation. The stage itself is a proscenium stage with flexible arch, minimum width 9 m, maximum width 13 m, minimum height 5 m, maximum height 9 m.

HART HOUSE
CITY: ADDRESS: ACOUSTICS CONSULTANT: ARCHITECT: OWNER: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: Toronto, Ontario 7 Hart House Circle N/A Sproatt and Rolph Massey Family $2,000,000 1919

THEATRE HISTORY
Inspired by the spirit of Oxford's colleges that embodied a dynamic social and recreational life, Vincent Massey, an alumni of Balliol College, pursued introducing a similar spirit to the institutional community of the University of Toronto. Having being promoted to a trustee of his family's funds in 1908, his ambition became reality as Massey proposed an architectural idea which housed all the universities extracurricular operations. The Hart House Theatre became one of Canada's leading theatres for small scale performances. Construction began in 1911 and the building was completed in 1919. Its opening night showcased The Queen's Enemies by Lord Dunsay to quite a success which was followed by various classical pieces such as A Midsummer Night's Dream, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, The Skin of Our Teeth, The Servant of Two Masters, The Father, etc. A traditionally styled architecture designed by Sproatt and Rolph, Hart House's details such as pointed arches, towering ceilings, detailed ornamentation and carvings give it an unmistakable gothic aesthetic. However, its structural system, deceivingly masonry, is actually steel and precast concrete with a sandstone cladding. The roof is of typical timbre construction even in the case of the theatre; its larger spans require barrel vaulted timber beams. The theatre itself is of a separate administration from the rest of the buildings facilities. Housing enough space to accommodate a 454 person audience while maintaining full accessibility, the theatre's architecture is humble despite its accredited influence on the beginnings of the Canadian theatre scene. The minimal use of sound absorption material in the interior of the theatre brings attention to the innate acoustic capabilities of Hart House Theatre's form.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
The opening of Hart House Theatre in 1919 signaled the beginning of an era of small scale productions that contributed to defining a bright age in Canadian theatre history. Despite advances in architectural acoustics by Wallace Sabine defined two decades earlier, Hart House Theatre's acoustic performance had been vernacularly integrated into the design of its form. Not only does the alternating blocks of seating help disperse sharp echo, simple measures of acoustic control such as velvet furnishing and carpet flooring contribute to enhancing the acoustic properties of the theatre. Despite the theatres simplicities, its curved slope is responsible for a lack of clarity.

ISABEL BADER THEATRE
CITY: ADDRESS: ACOUSTICS CONSULTANT: ARCHITECT: OWNER: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: Toronto, Ontario 93 Charles Street West Aerocoustics Engineering Ltd. Lett/Smith Architects University of Toronto, St. George Campus $18,000,000 2001

THEATRE HISTORY
Located at a prominent location within the University of Toronto St. George campus, the theatre sits across the street from the Royal Ontario Museum. It was designed by the architects Peter Smith, Elizabeth Pentek, Howard Wong, and Peter Yeadon from Lett/Smith Architects. Conceptual design and construction of the building commenced in 2001. The structural design was completed by Peter Sheffield and Associates. The mechanical and electrical components were organized by Crossey Engineering, and the landscape was designed by MBTWA. The acoustical consultants were Aercoustics Engineering Ltd., with further presentation equipment designed by Novita Ltd. The project was completed in Spring 2001 with a total construction cost of approximately $18,000,000, half of which was generously provided for by the Bader family. It is used as a lecture hall for the university during the daytime, and is also available for public rentals in the evenings. The theatre is also utilized as a screening venue during the Toronto International Film Festival. The hall holds 508 seats and a lobby with a reception capacity of 150 people. The theatre is part of the Victoria College within the University of Toronto community which has a reputation for it's heritage buildings that compose the academic facilities of the campus. The historical architecture that surrounds the Isabel Bader theatre are of gothic and romanesque style, and the materiality of the theatre is designed in a way to respond to those styles. The exterior façade utilizes grey owen sound limestone, copper framing, and wood finishes in order to create a natural-looking material palette. Over the years, the west wall has become covered in ivy allowing it to blend in better with the surrounding infrastructure. The interiors are a reflection of the exterior elements and incorporate exposed concrete columns, stucco walls, and stone finishes. Though the campus is diverse, and incorporates a blend of architectural styles, it does so in harmony with the similar use of materiality and design. The Isabel Bader Theatre won an award of Excellence in the 2001 Architecture and Urban Design Awards for the modernist architectural design that connects to the tradition of the surrounding buildings. The construction of the theatre made a significant impact to the university community because Victoria College is prominently known for its devotion to English drama, film, and liberal arts studies. The introduction of this theatre venue encouraged practices, performances, and concerts creating an active learning space. The overall design intent portrays openness and exaggeration of height to compliment the small areas of the building. The lobby includes stairs to the upper level which connects as a mezzanine overlooking the entrance. Balcony seats are accessible from the second level, and orchestra seats are stationed on the ground floor. The south façade features large curtain walls and glazing offering views out to the city and lots of natural light to penetrate in. The theatre building itself acts as a connecting hub between the public street and the university campus. The front entrance faces Charles Street which runs off of Queen's Park while the back entrance addresses a small courtyard for the Victoria college community.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
The Isabel Bader Theatre was intended as a lecture hall, performance space, and classroom for the University campus but quickly grew to a rental theatre within the downtown community. The acoustical finishes and techniques are strategically organized in order to optimize sound efficiency and clarity within the small area. The lateral wall assembly is composed of painted concrete finished with patterned wood panels that help to diffuse the sound within the space. The ground level features a total of 378 Orchestra seats including a rear elevated section of 52 seats, and 24 seats along the lateral walls. On this level there are sound reflectors stationed above the stage and above the rear elevated section while the remainder of the ceiling is covered with acoustical ceiling panels. On the second level of the theatre, the balcony consists of 122 seats and further incorporates ceiling reflectors to maximize sound reflection to the back seats. The floor assembly includes a concrete slab topped with carpet to absorb sound efficiently. The seats within the room are stationary theatre chairs with fabric cushions. All of the materials utilized help to decrease the reverberation time of sound, improving the quality and clarity of sound within the theatre. The audio of the theatre is controlled in the enclosed room behind the balcony which also administers any projections or screenings at the theatre. The railing panels for the balcony, lateral seating, and rear section of the theatre are part of the audio fill system that use 165 mm drivers with carbon fiber cones. The exterior side of the railing panels are lined with wood panels to reflect sound back to the central theatre space. This technique works efficiently because the side and back gallery seats form a horseshoe around the central orchestra seating. Therefore, the railing panels that enclose these spaces allow the reflected sound to be redirected towards the audience. The loudspeakers and subwoofer system enhance sound strength through use of advanced technology. There are also power amplifiers installed below the balcony to amplify sound in the back of the room. The proscenium is approximately 6 m high and leads right in to the galleria which has a height of approximately 8.5 m. This increase in height and elevation of seats within the theatre allows sound diffusion and more efficient sound travel as it bounces off the reflectors in the room. The design of the theatre was greatly impacted by the size and height limitations restricting the layout and exposure.

PANASONIC THEATRE

THEATRE HISTORY
The site of the Panasonic Theatre has a long history in Toronto entertainment. The theater that exists today in the heart of downtown Toronto at 651 Yonge Street was originally a four storey empire style with mansard roof private residence, built in 1911. In 1919, the house was gutted and transformed into a theatre called "The Victory". At the end of the First World War, its name changed to "The Embassy", in 1934. During the years ahead, the theater has been known as "The Astor", "The Showcase", and "The Festival". In 1970s, the theater was one of the premier venues for the "Festival of festival" which was later transformed into the Toronto International Film Festival. In 1993, the building was renovated and renamed the "New Yorker Theater" which later on premiered the Toronto Production of the off-Broadway musical forever plaid. During 2004 and 2005, the original building was demolished, except for the façade. A modern Theater was constructed, from the ground up, as a new, stateof-the-art live theatre and concert venue. It re-opened as "The Panasonic Theatre" in June, 2005, under the ownership of Live Nation. In January, 2008, the theatre was purchased by the company Key Brand Entertainment. However, in August 26, 2008, Mirvish Productions completed the purchase of the Panasonic Theatre, an entirely new venue with an extremely intimate space. Theater includes architect Gary Martinez of Washington DC's Martinez and Johnson, Michael DiBlasi of Schuler Shook theatre consultants in Minneapolis, acoustician Russ Todd of Akustiks in Norwalk, CT, and Torontobased architects Young + Wright. Martinez's goal was to achieve a high-tech look that responds to the visual intensity of a show that spills out into the audience. The initial plan was to add a balcony, but the theater was more deteriorated than the architects expected. More demolition happened than what was originally planned, yet certain elements such as the front façade of the building were saved to keep the character of the original building. A new concrete and steel structure was inserted into the chasm of the original building to support not only the new roof and predicted electric wiring loads, but also the new balcony. The new hightech lobby has a contemporary look, with architectural lighting by Schuler Shook that includes programmable Color Kinetics iColor accent tubes.

Since the theatrical lighting, audio, and projection systems require specific supports for both permanent and portable rigging, a road house with significant infrastructure for these systems as well as data and power distribution via cable racks and sleeves that run throughout the room was provided. A catwalk system wraps around the entire venue, with a technical mezzanine located front of house. Use of catwalk allows easy access to production equipment as well as electric wiring and lighting positions. In addition, they are four The theatre is suitable for small productions, comedy, exposed audio systems, located below the wrapping concerts, graduations, press conferences, lectures and catwalk system as well as integrating company switches meetings. The 704 seats are split between the main floor in the room design to support lighting, audio, video, and (427) and balcony (277) levels. The seats themselves are rigging in critical locations. Quattro series by Hussey Seating in Maine, and have a contemporary look with black upholstery with graphite stanchions, fitting in nicely with the dark space.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
With the consideration of the overall design of the Panasonic Theater, the architectural design and finishes play a significant role in the acoustic environment within the theatre. The Panasonic Theater has been renovated expressly for an entertainment company called the "Blue Man Group". Due to the special needs of Blue Man Group, a simple renovation became a more significant project in order to provide the right infrastructure in the theater to support their production needs for a long run. The cubic shape of the room made it easier to control the acoustics. As rectangular rooms have 3 pairs of parallel walls the reflections at especially low frequencies will cause up high spatial variations of the sound pressure level in the room. The new walls of the theater are constructed of concrete masonry units. The concrete masonry units are filled with grout to eliminate the voids in the cores which result to enhance the acoustical performance, while reducing the transmission of sound. The fact that Blue Man Groups' performances are highly amplified, led the acoustician Russ Todd to use absorptive acoustic material behind the interior perforated metal walls of the theatre. The panels are constructed from 22 gauge perforated galvanized steel which are folded along the vertical edges and are reinforced at each end with solid channels. Each panel is filled with a 2 inch thick, fiberglass sound absorber encapsulated in a heat sealed poly vinyl bag. The fiberglass sound absorber panels have a Noise Reduction Coefficient of 0.90. The loudspeaker system that was designed for the theatre is a central loudspeaker cluster, selected because the theatre is a medium-sized room and the seats are fairly similar distances away from the loudspeaker cluster. The sound quality of the room is achieved through four ANCHOR AN-1000X monitors, ten EAW two-way full range speakers, six L-ACOUSTICS DVDOSC small linear array speakers. The four self-powered subwoofer loudspeakers are MEYER USW-1P that

provides flat response in the 32 - 180 Hz range. The USW-1P is coupled with four UPA-P Series self-powered loudspeakers to form full-range reproduction systems, and is also enhanced with six other Meyer Sound selfpowered mid-high loudspeakers.

PRINCESS OF WALES THEATRE
CITY: ADDRESS: ACOUSTICS CONSULTANT: ARCHITECT: OWNER: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: Toronto, Ontario 300 King Street West Aerocoustics Engineering Ltd. Lett-Smith Architects Mirvish Productions $53,076,920 CAD 2009

THEATRE HISTORY
The Princess of Wales Theatre was built by Ed and David Mirvish of Honest Ed's, a landmark store in Toronto and Mirvish Productions, a Toronto based theatrical production company and promoter. At the time of construction, Princess of Wales was the only privately owned and financed theatre built in Canada since the Royal Alexandra in 1907. Along with the Princess of Wales, the Mirvish family owns the Royal Alexandra, the Ed Mirvish, and the Panasonic Theatres. The project architect was Peter Smith of Toronto firm Lett-Smith, who was also involved with the Harbourfront Centre Theatre in Toronto and the restoration of Grand Theatre in London, Ontario. Christopher Hume, renowned Toronto architectural critic, describes the threatre as "...a glittering glass jewelry case, a sparkling glimpse into a spectacle of total design." The theatre is configured as a traditional proscenium theatre, and has orchestra, dress circle, and balcony levels. Construction of the Princess of Wales Theatre began in August of 1991, and opened in May of 1993 for a total construction cost of around $53 million CAD. As part of the construction, David Mirvish commissioned a series of murals by Frank Stella, an American abstract expressionist painter. These murals cover 1,000 m2 of the domed ceiling, proscenium arch, and the walls of the lobbies and lounges that occupy all four floors of the theatre. Stella, along with the murals, also designed the decorative fronts of the boxes and balconies, and the end-caps of each row of seating. In September of 2012, David Mirvish and Frank Gehry unveiled a plan to demolish the theatre and create a mixed-use condominium building which would include museums and retail spaces. In response to a large amount of criticism from city planners and the public, a revised plan was announced in May 2014 which involved keeping the theatre in its current state.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
The theatre's capacity is 2,000, with each seat not further than 26 metres from the stage. This closeness is achieved by the long balcony overhang, extended two rows further from the original iteration. The results are seen in the acoustic measurements, where early decay times and acoustics strength levels are severely decreases underneath the balconies. Architect Peter Smith's design utilized a 9 metre opening in the ceiling which had a tension grid for lighting within, which raised a concern for a lack of early reflections. The geometry of the theatre is a horseshoe shape plan inside a rectangle. The horseshoe shape enables the balcony facia to produce good early reflections over a significant area over the balcony. Facia reflections have a number of advantages over ceiling reflections. These include: reaching the seating underneath the balcony, lateral reflections over most seats which encourages source broadening, and they arrive at listeners in the middle of the room sooner than similar reflections off side walls. The walls consists of 300 mm poured concrete with 16 mm of gypsum board laminated and nailed into the wall to prevent the absorption of low-frequency sound. The ceiling contains two layers of 17 mm gypsum board, with tar paper in between to increase damping. Primitive roof diffusers were designed for the theatre and installed on the back walls and in the orchestra pit. The theatre has no acoustical curtains, no oversized volume, and the seats are upholstered on the front, armrests, and back.

ROYAL ALEXANDRA THEATRE
CITY: ADDRESS: ACOUSTICS CONSULTANT: ARCHITECT: OWNER: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: Toronto, Ontario 260 King Street West Aerocoustics Engineering, Ltd. (recent acoustic intervention) John M. Lyle Ed Mirvish Enterprises $750,000 1907

THEATRE HISTORY
Known today as a highly innovative Beaux-Arts design masterpiece and one of the finest theatres on the continent, the Royal Alexandra Theatre is a key North American historic canon in theatrical architecture. Located at the heart of Toronto's Entertainment District near the intersection of King Street West and Simcoe Street, the Royal Alexandra today represents the oldest, continuously-operating, legitimate theatre since 1907 hosting over nearly 3,000 musical productions, lectures and countless social gatherings. Originally designed by the Irish-Canadian born architect John MacIntosh Lyle in association with Carrère and Hastings of New York and funded by Cawthra Mullock, the theatre became Toronto's first steel-frame structure and North America's first air conditioned and fire protected theatre as well. The design which includes 1,497 available seats on a lot that is approximately 30 m by 56 m was achieved using a technique of three separate levels of seating: orchestra, balcony and upper balcony. It was the first theatre to incorporate the innovative structural cantilever design principle which provided significant techniques on improving sightlines and acoustics of the three leveled space. Built on a system of steel grids and reinforced concrete, this new structural approach allowed the typical interior balcony support columns to be eliminated and the floors to be cantilevered out, radial in shape and steeply elevated. The overall building contains four distinct sections. The section fronting the building's main street is the administration building which holds the box office, lobbies, lounges, and washrooms. At the centre of the building is the auditorium holding the theatre's seating area. Granted a royal title in honour of Queen Alexandra by King Edward VII, the theatre brought shows from London, New York, and many other international productions. Originally designed as a "road house", the Royal Alexandra Theatre was a place for touring shows. This meant stage space on its small site was far more important than storage and other work space areas. With the rise of cinema, radio and television during the early 1950's, the Royal Alexandra became unable to compete. Advancing technologies lead the fall of the theatre and brought controversy as to whether or not it should be offered for sale or demolished. It was not until 1963 that the theatre was purchased by its new owner and saviour Ed Mirvish. He, who knew little about the Arts and Theatre, became intrigued by the building's historic quality and character to the surrounding Toronto community. For three months the theatre was then closed down for extensive modernisation, repair and renovation. On September 9th, 1963 the theatre reopened with a grand evening occasion. The play for the evening was a comedy titled Never Too Late by Sumner Arthur Long and directed by George Abbott. That night and for the next 23 years hundreds of guests experienced the theatre's new rejuvenated facelift. The theatre's restoration sparked revitalization of the surrounding area and further influenced the growth of Toronto's entertainment district. During this time the theatre was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada and has since been required to maintain its original style and appearance. In 1986 Ed Mirvish handed the ownership of the theatre over to his son, David Mirvish, and has since been operated by the administrative body of Mirvish Productions.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
In determining the dimensions of the auditorium, John Lyle took two factors into consideration. The width of the stage or, more importantly, the width of the proscenium arch, the "picture-frame" of the stage. The width of the arch determined the sightlines and the maximum width of the auditorium, which Lyle calculated to be 23 m. Lyle was considerate to stay within the calculated 23 m in order to have sufficient space for fire-escape stairs, wider side aisles, and unobstructed views. The best shape in theatre auditorium for the acoustics of the human voice was considered to be a cube. The architect tried to come to a square floor plan, and designed the auditorium to be 23 m by 22 m by 20 m. The auditorium, built of steel frame construction, has three levels of seating: the Orchestra, the Front Balcony, and the Upper Balcony. The reinforced concrete on steel frame balconies allowed Lyle to become a daring innovator in balcony construction. The balconies are built to be securely bolted to the side walls and cantilevered to the rear wall, meaning that the full weight of the balconies could be borne by the steel frame of the building with no visible supports. At the time, this meant that the Royal Alexandra would be the first theatre in North America to be built with no internal pillars, and thus, no obstructed-view seats. Setting the balconies higher than normal allowed Lyle to actually improve the acoustics of the back rows, shaping the high ceilings under the balcony overhangs to create a megaphone effect. A drawback to the cantilever principle, from the owner's point of view, was that it limited the depth of the balconies and the number of balcony seats. Other theatres extended their pillar-supported balconies much farther over the orchestra, increasing the seat count by five or six more rows, but this had a negative impact on acoustics as well as sightlines. The shallowness of the balconies also meant that Lyle had to build the uppermost level as a dizzingly steep rake. The steep rake had a great benefit, however, as it gave every seat in the gallery an exceptionally good view of the full stage. In the end, Lyle felt that the improvements to the quality of the auditorium justified the reduction in potential revenue. Another important decorative and acoustical element of the Royal Alexandra theatre - an element which many modern theatres are attempting to eliminate - is the proscenium, the decorative arch or "picture-frame" around the stage. Aside from decorative purposes, the proscenium defines the stage area and hides all the machinery, wires, ropes, cables, props, costume racks, lights, sets and scenery above the stage or in the wings. It is shaped like the bell of a horn and acts as a sound projector. As the arch is a sound projector, the sounding board is a sound reflector, designed to bounce the voices of actors on the stage into the balconies. As a reflector, the sounding board had to have a smooth surface, but rather than leaving it blank and empty, the Royal Alexandra's sounding board was painted by famous artist, Frederick Sproston Challener. To sum up, the combination of the cube-like dimensions, the high balconies, and the proscenium are all essential benefactors to the acoustics of the space.

RYERSON THEATRE
CITY: ADDRESS:  ACOUSTICS CONSULTANT: ARCHITECT: OWNER: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: Toronto, Ontario 43 Gerrard Street East N/A Burwell R. Coon Ryerson University N/A 1963

THEATRE HISTORY
Ryerson Theatre, located in Kerr Hall, was designed by Burwell R. Coon from 1952 to 1956 while construction took place from 1957 to 1963. Kerr Hall as a whole is divided into the four cardinal directions: North, East, South, and West. The Ryerson Theatre is situated in Kerr Hall North, which was the first of the large three-part construction (north, west, then east) that took place. Kerr Hall was expanded in order to accommodate the increasing amount of students at Ryerson University. The building, when undergoing construction, surrounded the old Toronto Normal School (demolished 1963). After the completion of Kerr Hall, the theatre was used to house lectures and part-time courses until 1971 when Ryerson theatre school, a full time program that specialized in theatre training, acting, dance, arts administration and technical production was opened. Over the years the Ryerson Theatre had several renovations to increase the capacity of the theatre, as well as improving and repurposeing some of the spaces. There were also temporary and permanent renovations made to the theatre space itself, to improve general comfort and experience for occupants. Temporary renovations include small setup constructions such as bleachers for specific showings or plays. It has been used for fashion shows, multicultural diversity shows, and most notably venued several Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) events. The current use of the theatre ranges from hosting plays, concerts, movie/artistic film screenings, and a fashion show held by Ryerson's School of Fashion.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
Built as the first part of Kerr Hall's construction, the Ryerson Theatre naturally conformed to the rectilinear shape of the rest of the building. With an overall capacity of 1237 seats shared between the `orchestra' (main floor seating), the mezzanine, and the balcony, the theatre had, and still maintains, flexibility for a variety of uses throughout the years. Between common use by the Ryerson Theatre School, staging plays, orchestras, movie screenings, and even the yearly `Mass Exodus' held by Ryerson's School of Fashion, the theatre was designed to work well for various performances. The theatre is approximately 40 m long and 23 m wide. There are 41 rows of 22-36 seats, aligned in rigid order. The control room sits at the third floor of Kerr Hall, while the main entrance to the seating is on the first floor. The 10m ceiling above the seating is shallowly coffered. It is layed out in a grid of nine squares with each square containing a round diffuser at the centre. Large lighting fixtures are vertically aligned up the sides of the theatre with an acoustic pad in between. These sound absorbing installations are one floor height above the ground to prevent late echoes from reaching the balcony seating. Sound absorbing panels also align the rear walls. The main floor seating is not covered too much by the balcony with the relatively small amount of seating, so acoustic dead zones are also not an issue. Its simple design works great for regular theatre or play practices. There is also an orchestra pit just in front of the stage 1.37 m below it and just 0.3 m below the audience level. It seats around 20 musicians. The Ryerson Theatre is also famous for the Toronto International Film Festival screenings, regular screenings in general, and its yearly fashion show held by the School of Fashion. These events are heavily aided by audio equipment. The theatre uses two Renkus Heinz CTBs and two Renkus Heinz Subs aligned in a left, right, and centre cluster front fill. Wall mounted speakers also line the left and right walls, each situated below the vertical lighting fixtures. The abundance of audio equipment also dictates the need for the sound absorbing panels lining the walls.

CITY: ADDRESS: ACOUSTICS CONSULTANT: ARCHITECT: OWNER: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: Thornhill, Ontario 525 New Westminster Drive Novita Techne Diamond and Schmitt Architects York Catholic District School Board $10,000,000 2006

THEATRE HISTORY
Completed in early 2006, the St. Elizabeth School Theatre is a $10,000,000 state of the art performance space for the school's Regional Arts Program for drama, dance, visual arts, and music students in York Region. The theatre is connected to St. Elizabeth Catholic high School, aiding not only to their art and theatre programs, but helping students pursue interests in radio and television arts working with audio equipment, performance or theatre management and design by employing them for volunteer hours. The theatre was realized through a partnership which included the City, the School Board, Opera York, and the private sector. The School Board initially raised $ 3,500,000 independently for the development of the theatre, however felt that the amount was insufficient in creating a comprehensive performing arts centre. The issue was tackled through a task force set up by the school board, in order to procure approximately $10,000,000. The larger funding allowed to build a space with the ability to accommodate a variety of uses from musical concerts, productions, dance and live theatre. Project broke ground in November 2005, with architects Diamond Schmitt leading the architectural design in coordination with Novita Techne acting as the theatre and AV multimedia consultants, and Bondfield Construction as General Contractor. The theatre is a 557 m space which can be configured to various needs, such as yield theatre-in-the-round, proscenium and flat floor configurations. The theatre also features 300 retractable seats, lighting gallery levels, catwalk, balcony level and control room. In addition, to the theatre, the centre includes a rehearsal hall and practice rooms which comprises 836 m. The centre also includes a work-shop, stage pit, and wardrobe maintenance classrooms.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
St. Elizabeth Theatre is a `shoebox' typology; a rectangular space reminiscent of old theatre forms employs in Italy and Germany in the 18th Century, primarily used for concert halls. Diamond and Schmitt Architects consulted with Novita Techne to modernize York Region need to accommodate both music and drama performance. This theatre is an investigation in creating budget-conscious and flexible performance space. Perhaps the most prominent feature of the theatre is the limited mechanical system. Housed in a separate cavity on the opposite side of the entrance atrium, supply air comes across in small ducts across the lobby, isolated by rubber gaskets to quiet vibrations. Ductwork widens as they reach the theatre space, to allow air to move slower and quieter. The air then travels into a perforated metal `bucket' and is showered into the room in silence. Return air filters exist in the concrete massing walls behind retractable seating storage. Because the theatre needs to accommodate for both musical and drama performances, the architects employed flexible wall surface applications. East and West interior walls are made of poured concrete with wooden panels attached and velour drapery. Drapery would be used during drama shows to absorb sounds quickly for clarity of performances. Yet since musical recitals require longer reverberation times, sound must be reflecting off surfaces; therefore the drapes would be left unused so that sound can bounce off the hard concrete walls to create a larger volume and dramatic presence. Back walls are also composed of poured concrete but with a wood lattice attachment to break up sound, avoid flutter echo, and force it to bounce in many different directions to constructively reinforce and add to the warmth of the sound. This same wooden lattice is repeated on the proscenium at the front of the theatre. Retractable seating adds to the flexibility of the space; with 12 rows hidden in concrete walls, and three hidden beneath floor slabs, the multipurpose space is able to accommodate for orchestra settings where floor panels are extracted to expose a typical orchestra performance pit, regular performances on a ground level stage when all rows are retracted, or large performance when all rows are hidden at the back and audience sits in permanent seating. Each one of the 374 seats within the theatre is finished with a soft acoustical sponge for seat and back. The floor system required great attention, necessitating an acoustically sensitive floor assembly. The assembly is comprised of a poured concrete slab, topped with 50 mm x 100 mm sleepers with intermediate insulation, and a final finishing of a marmoleum tile. This design significantly lowers sound transmission from occupant circulation and acts as an absorption plane during performances.

WINTER GARDEN THEATRE
CITY: ADDRESS: ACOUSTICS CONSULTANT: ARCHITECT: OWNER: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: RESTORATION DATE: RESTORATION COST: Toronto, Ontario 189 Yonge Street David Hannivan Thomas W. Lamb Marcus Loew (now Ontario Heritage Trust) $29,000,000 1913 1986 $29,000,000 (for Elgin and Winter Garden)

THEATRE HISTORY
The Winter Garden Theatre is a representative of a rare, lost architectural typology and style. This theatre lies within a complex that is fully operational in conjunction with the Elgin Theatre. Both theatres have their own distinctive characteristics and style. The most unique feature of the theatre complex (known as Elgin and Winter Garden Theatres) is that the two theatres are stacked vertically, a rare typology that has been attempted only a few times up to the year of its completion in 1913. The Elgin and Winter Garden Theatres was commissioned in 1908, being completed in 1913. The client/owner, Marcus Loew, believed that you pay not only to see the performance, but also to experience the theatre. With this philosophy, Loew hired Thomas White Lamb, a new and fresh architect at the time, to design the theatre. Lamb was a New York-based Scottish architect, who started his career as a building inspector. The theatre was designed during Lamb's "experimental phase" as he was approached very early in his architectural career. The complex was not only an architectural feat with its double-decker design, but also a structural one. Each of the theatres houses a mezzanine seating level that uses a double-truss system that allows it to cantilever from 6 columns. In February 1914, the Winter Garden Theatre was completed with a grand staircase that lead from the lobby, up 7 storeys to the Winter Garden Theatre. Both theatres were equipped for live performances, especially to accommodate the popular vaudeville styled acts in that era. Although both theatres were to show similar acts, each theatre catered to different audiences and offered different atmospheres that were intricately decorated to fulfill Loew's philosophy. Of the two theatres, the Winter Garden Theatre is the smaller one, seating 992 people. The Winter Garden Theatre was more atmospheric and inspired by "roof top garden theatres" that trended in the US during the early 1900's. These trending roof top garden theatres were open aired and simple in design, making them unsuitable for the harsh winters of Toronto. The Winter Garden resolved this issue by being an enclosed theatre with intricate garden decor. The Winter Garden also had higher admission prices with reserved seating and only offered one show per night. Although criticized for its typology, the theatre complex was successful until the popularization of motion pictures. By the 1930's, the popularity of motion picture soundtracks declined the demand for live action theatre and forced the Winter Garden Theatre to close in 1928. As the Elgin Theatre reached its lowest in the 1970's, it was planned to be torn down and rebuilt as a car park to accommodate the growing Toronto population. In 1981, the complex was purchased by the Ontario Ministry of Tourism and Culture, with the closed Winter Garden theatre. Along with being recognized as an essential part of Toronto's history, the theatres were also bought due to the need for more stages that were capable of supporting live performances. As the downtown core began to flourish with new retail and businesses, it attracted new life and tourists to the entertainment and business area. A $29,000,000 full restoration of the theatre complex was comissioned to Mandel Sprachman Architects in 1986. The double-decker complex was restored to its former glory that was presented in 1913, but with updates to the equipment and fire standards. The Elgin Theatre had its grand reopening in 1989 alongside the restored Winter Garden Theatre.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
The Winter Garden Theatre is unique as a typology when presented with its counterpart, the Elgin Theatre, and is also renowned as a theatre on its own. Inspired by trending roof top garden theatres at the time, the intention for the Winter Garden Theatre was to provide the same romantic atmosphere, but in an enclosed environment. Marcus Loew, the client, had a strong belief in a theatre having atmosphere that was comparable or better than the shows there were to be played. This belief lead to much attention to the intricate details and décor of the theatre. To mimic the outdoor environment, the Winter Garden Theatre was elaborately decorated with sculpted ornaments, hand-painted murals, and preserved garden features such as beech branches. The columns were covered with carved plaster that mimic a tree trunk. Preserved beech branched were painted orange, plum and yellow and were hung from a suspended ceiling to create a forest-like atmosphere that cleared towards the stage. Also scattered along the ceiling were stainglass lanterns that provided a surrealistic, warm, welcoming atmosphere. The Winter Garden Theatre, unlike precedents of roof top garden theatres, also had cantilevered mezzanines that floated above the hanging beech leaves. This provided additional seating and were also elaborately decorated with garden décor. The theatre, bare of its garden décor, is of concrete and steel structure, most of which is covered. The floors were carpeted to provide acoustic absorption and most other surfaces were covered in carved plaster decor. The heavily decorated theatre had no real intention of affecting the acoustical properties of the theatre from the décor in 1913, but ultimately did. During the restoration of the theatre in 1986, was decided to take into account when redoing the leaf-covered ceiling. Due to the absorption and diffusion properties of the leaves, they finally installed less leaves that there were initially. During the restoration of the theatre, a heavy firerated curtain was installed to provide a fire separation between the stage and audience in case of an emergency. The architect found the fire-rated curtain to be unaesthetically pleasing, therefore hired an artistic to paint a garden-themed mural upon it. This curtain is usually only in use during offproductions, or if requested during productions. This heavy curtain has less absorption capability than its soft, fabric counterpart. In comparison to the Elgin Theatre, the Winter Garden Theatre overall has a smaller reverberation time. Both theatres are small in volume and are heavily decorated in plaster ornaments and are carpeted.

AGA KHAN MUSEUM AUDITORIUM
CITY: ADDRESS:  ACOUSTICS CONSULTANT: ARCHITECT: OWNER: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: Toronto, Ontario 77 Wynford Drive Air Acoustics Fumihiko Maki His Highness The Aga Khan IV (Aga Khan Development Network) $300,000,000 (museum) 2014

THEATRE HISTORY
His Highness the Aga Khan IV is a major religious leader for the Ismaeli people who has taken the initiative to create a museum of Muslim culture: the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto. On September 14, 2014, Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper and His Highness the Aga Khan celebrated the opening ceremony of the first Islamic-based museum and cultural gem of its type in North America. Since opening, the museum houses permanent and specialized collections of preserved art, works and artifacts of cultural and historical significance; some have been donated from His Highness the Aga Khan's personal collection as well. This museum aims to bring programs and activities that offer insight on Islamic societies under the mission of the Aga Khan Development Network. It is seen as an institution for heritage, open to all. Architecturally, the museum is based on strong concepts of light, space and geometrical patterns. It is reminiscent of traditional spaces. The design team was lead by well-known architects Fumihiko Maki and Charles Correa whom coordinated with acoustic specialists Air Acoustics to truly integrate the architecture and different acoustic functions. The auditorium is a very important point for gathering people, conveying information and creating new perspectives. The auditorium can be seen as a large auditorium at times, or a cultural entertainment space. Keeping consistent with the rest of the museum building, the auditorium captures the essence of traditional Ismaeli worship spaces by the dome and "Heavenly Light" from above, as well as geometrical patterning and detailing along the walls. The quality of the space was also determined by reducing energy usage by reflecting light within spaces with minimized electrical lighting and little glazing. It is a space that gives a sense of separation to the outside world, and instead, entrance to a special space. The design is meant to give viewers a sense of cultural decor without imposing religion, since the facility is a public environment. Because the museum neighbours a noisy major highway - the Don Valley Parkway - the auditorium had to be constructed as sound-proof as possible from the outside. Originally, the auditorium was designed to hold lectures and speeches only periodically; but then it was acoustically reprogrammed to house frequent performances (live music, dances, artistic acts).

Based off of God, the Heavens, and Infinity, the auditorium uses a "pure" hexagonal geometry along with many other repeated elements along the side walls and even the high ceiling above, which is a dome-like shape created by the hexagonal plan.

At the large architectural scale, materials such as prefabricated, acoustically-insulated Balsa Foam (similar to Gypsum Board) are used on a majority of the walls. This material was specifically chosen to accomplish sharp edge finishes on the ceiling dome (which is entirely suspended with aircraft cables). Although all the walls (and inside of the stage) are acoustically-insulated, the design team intentionally placed their Teak Wood finish on the floors and at lowest level side walls beside the audience in order to reflect sound, from the stage outwards. The stage itself is a large amplifier that holds additional sound equipment along the perimeter, keeping the space very "clean" architecturally. All seatings for the audience have Felt finishes for sound absorption and comfort. The acoustics of the space were based primarily on flexibility and the ability to reconfigure sound specifications for different types of events and program (i.e. lectures have different settings than performing arts). A clever component that was added is a patterned metal screen along the side walls that holds a motorized drape system behind, called the "V Wall" which can be

THEATRE HISTORY
Before December of 2011, the people of Burlington had to venture outside the boundaries of their town to experience the performing arts. Now, after the opening of the Burlington Performing Arts Centre, the residents have the ability to travel downtown to experience a live opera performance, a beautiful symphonic orchestra or an amazing dance trope. The building has attained a LEED Gold certification and is the first performing arts center in Ontario to attain such a standard. The building is located on the site of a former police station, relatively close to the downtown core. The center consists of a black box studio theatre and a much larger 718 seat main theatre and is used by many local acts as well as traveling acts and artists. The main concept behind the project was to have two arms, which cradled the acoustically sensitive program spaces including the family lobby, main theatre and the studio theatre. The north arm consists of the public interior gathering space, otherwise known as the Elgin Street Galleria, to be used as a pre-show gathering space as well as a small informal performance and non-performance event space. The south arm consists of the technical spaces for the center. It includes all dressing rooms, administrative program and technical aspects of the building. This portion of the building acts as an acoustic buffer zone between the parking structure and the performance spaces. The main theatre was designed in the classical shoebox proportions and features mainly wood along with terrazzo flooring and textured concrete walls. The wooden elements in the theatre bring a feeling of warmth, while the seating arrangement was designed to create a smaller and more intimate connection between the audience and the performers. This helps to create a stronger experience for the theatre audience. The large room consisting of 718 seats was designed to have excellent sightlines from all seats within the theatre. The wood and concrete plays a large part in helping with the amplification of acoustic based performances such as opera, piano recitals and orchestral events. The textured concrete helps to eliminate the occurrence of standing waves within the theatre and the wooden elements are angled so that there are no parallel surfaces . The auditorium was designed to be flexible in terms of the types of events and performances. When the need arises, for the theatre to accommodate an amplified event, soft curtains on the sides of the room will lower, covering most of the concrete walls, helping with the absorption of sound waves and lowering the reverberation time.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
The program of the theatre demanded a flexibility of the space and thus the acoustic requirements. Unlike single use spaces, there is a need to accommodate several programs from speech presentations to symphonic concertos. The building's careful selection of materials strongly accounted for both design and acoustic considerations. The main envelope of the theatre was concrete; a 300 mm cast in place wall with a steel composite deck construction for the roof. This was critical in providing the noise separation desired. One of the inherent properties of concrete is that it prevents exterior sound from entering the performance space. This was carefully designed, especially given the considerations of the HVAC systems protruding into the walls. This allowed an acoustic separation and achieved the goal of a low Noise Criterion (NC) rating of NC-20. There are unique forms that were cast in the process of the concrete wall pours. Using Reckli Panels (installed on the long side of the room) allowed a `bas-relief' pattern within the concrete walls, each with a different depth and angle. This allowed for the sound to be reflected in a multitude of directions, reducing the sound focal points and diffusing it into the audience. For the interior finish, the main material was wood. Just as how concrete played a role in diffusing the sound, the wood was carefully modeled to determine the optimal conditions to hear sound for each seat. Aside from the material choice, the acoustic panels in the ceiling are used to control the sound through quarter sawn oak panels, providing both architectural intimacy and acoustic richness. The ceiling is designed in an angular form to allow some reflection of the sound back to the audience. For the symphonic needs of the theatre, a larger volume is needed. Above the acoustic ceiling panels, which are generously spaced apart, a large hidden volume of space allows the sound to further reverberate and linger, as required by a more dramatic use of the room. To accommodate for the flexibility of the room, the curtains are a major design factor. The heavy velour curtains also continue above the ceiling to control the reverberations when the amplification is used. There are also heavy velour curtain systems located at the sides of the Main Theatre that can be controlled to drop down and cover the textured concrete and accommodate the reverberations during an amplified event. The curtains are then raised when the acoustics of the room need to accommodate a nonamplified event such as opera or spoken word. Overall, the theatre was designed with as few parallel surfaces as possible to avoid echoing and uneven distribution of sound. An example of this was to use tilted wood paneling ribs on the main balcony. The overall general proportions followed the classic shoe box proportion to further enhance to enhance acoustic quality to a greater degree.

THEATRE HISTORY
Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts is Toronto's recognizable opera house located in the heart of downtown Toronto at the intersection of University Ave and Queen St West. It is admired for it's relation to the city in the immediate and urban scales, emphasis on the accessibility of performance arts as well as architectural and acoustic design. The theatre is the home for the Canadian Opera Company (COC), shared with Nation Ballet of Canada. The design was therefore tailored both through physical and acoustic attributes to best suit opera and ballet performances. The site, of approximate $30,000,000 land value, was donated to the COC by the Government of Canada. The land maintains significant historic value through its immediate connections to Osgood hall and the Toronto City hall. The COC was able to emphasize the presence of opera within the context of Canadian history through the development of the Four Seasons Centre. The Four Seasons Centre design came to be from a competition held in 2002, organized by the COC. Diamond Schmitt Architects Inc. design was chosen out of the ten submitted entries. The design was chosen because it embodied a contemporary expression of relevant historic principles. Construction concluded in 2006. The project totaled to approximately $150,000,000, making the FSC one of Canada's most expensive theatres. On the exterior, the building design addresses the surrounding context on a large scale, imitating the geometries of the surrounding condo and office tower buildings while showing an appreciation for Toronto's physical grid layout. The interior, encompassing the auditorium, is an organic form from its horseshoe shape; it acts as a juxtaposition to the exterior rigid geometry. The entrance of the building, accessible from Queen St, was design as a continuation of the sidewalk. The design intention was to open up the area from Queen St, running along University Ave. to make the entrance accessible to everyone as well as maintaining a relationship with the exterior from the interior. This resulted in the design of the "City Room", an open, curtainwall area acting as the perfect transition from the street to the auditorium. The auditorium, known as the R. Fraser Elliott Hall, was designed in reference to the traditional fivetiered European horseshoe. With the relatively small approximate area of 912 m2, the auditorium was able to achieve an intimacy between the performers and audience. The intimacy was underlined by the physical closeness between the audience to the stage, with no seat further than 36 m from the stage. The interior aesthetics was emphasized through intelligently planned views and material selection. Each seat was computer tested to have a great, unobstructed view of the stage. The colour scheme of the auditorium is light de-saturated green rather than more commonly used red seating, adding to the aesthetic of the design without taking away the emphasis on the performance. Overall, the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts is valued as one of Canada's most reputable opera houses due to its design with high degrees of both functional and acoustic qualities.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
The acoustics of the Four Seasons Centre are known to be of excellent quality. The space was designed acoustically by Robert Essert of Sound Space Design Ltd. with several other consultants. The design was accounted for the best standards for opera performances. The five-tiered horseshoe shape was a successful choice. The size of the auditorium proved to add to the quality of the sound without taking away from the intimacy of physical closeness to the performance and the main sound source. "...[A]n inaugural Canadian Opera Company production of Wagner's complete Ring of the Nibelung showed off well-nigh ideal acoustics for opera: almost eerily transparent but also spacious, with an even frequency response and a good balance between stage and pit." --Scott Cantrell, Dallas Morning News Being in the heart of downtown Toronto and connected to vehicular traffic, pedestrian busy streets and the subway, the auditorium faced some difficult acoustic challenges. The main challenge was therefore to achive high sound insulation, above a parking garage and adjacent to both the Queen St. streetcar and the Yonge-University subway line. The solution to the main challenge was the use of large rubber isolating pads designed to resist gravity and lateral forces as well as support the entire auditorium area. To separate the main level from the parking, acoustic joints were used. The interior included finish materials which improved the sound qualities of the FSC. Some of the main materials contributing to the qualities were breech wood, absorbing hardwood flooring, and textured gypsum walls. For further acoustic quality development, the consultants used a computer modeling system using the program CATTAcoustic. With the help of acoustic computing, the firm was able to conduct many experiments indicating the acoustic qualities of the space. The model was also able to produce audible sounds as they would be heard in the auditorium to help illustrate the aural qualities of the design. With the help of acoustic modeling, the attention to detail was furthered by computer testing provided by Sound space Design Ltd. The theatre was tested to make sure the sound distribution was good on a large scale. Each seat was then tested to make sure the viewer would not only have an unobstructed view but also great sound quality.

THEATRE HISTORY
The Living Arts Centre was designed by Zeidler Partnership Architects and the acoustic consultants were Artec Consultant Inc. It is located at 4141 Living Arts Drive, Missisauga, Ontario, in close proximity to the city centre. Nearby buildings include the Missisauga City Hall and Square One Shopping Mall. The main concept of the building was to create an environment where the traditional visual and performing arts and smaller community activities could create a symbiosis. Subsequently, many years of discussion took place with the community prior to the conceptual and formal design of the theatre. This process lead to a program organization that is complicated, yet interrelated to promote community engagement with art related activities. The main venue is called Hammerson Hall, which accommodates around 1,300 seats. It is equiped to host ballet, symphony, and opera related events. Seatings are arranged in a horseshoe type that is separated into three levels. The theatre prides itself in having seats that is no further than 38 m away from the stage. The stage of the hall is adjustable, allowing it to accommodate different performances. A second venue is called Theatre II, and it accommodates around 400 seats that are removable. Its primary function is as a recital hall, and seating is laid out in a shoebox type arrangement. Besides the two main performance venues, the building host several other smaller spaces that accommodate less formal programs. This includes lecture and rehearsal spaces, music studios and practice cubicles, visual art studios, computer studios, and flexible rentable rooms. These spaces are connected with the two main venues by the triple height atrium. This atrium is a statement to the idea that Eberhart Zeidler tried to voice: "the arts are interactive events, created by people for people, not something outside of the community, but something very much a part of the community. The architectural treatment is, therefore, not of a temple of culture, but of a workplace where one creates culture." The atrium also serves as a flexible space for the theatre. It becomes a foyer during concerts and formal events. Similarly, the circulation inside the building is created with numerous informal gathering spaces and pause spaces to try to encourage social encounters within the building.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
The Hammerson Hall is the largest and main performing space in The Living Arts Centre. Artec consultants provided Design and Planning services covering pre-design phase services, auditorium design, facility planning, specialized performance equipment systems design and background noise and vibration control consulting for the centre. Hammerson Hall was considered as a separate building from the rest of the building from the schematic design phase. This resulted in inception of a building within a building which became an important factor for soundproofing the hall. Also, the joint connecting the two buildings about 40 mm thick, is filled with rubber like material, acting as a buffer zone. This in turn absorbs all the vibrations from and towards Hammerson Hall. The building is dimensioned carefully to provide desirable sightlines and sound quality. There are no seats further than 38 m from the centre of the stage. The hall features an acoustic shell, which is ideal for full-scale plays, concerts, major touring productions, and community events. The walls of the shell are constructed by moving the required number of concert towers into the desired position. Acoustic shells are used predominantly in the hall. The structure of wall is comprised of cinder block units, 152 mm inches of rigid insulation, 152 mm of air and the interior structure. It also consists of double layers of drywall. The interior finish uses pebble stone texture using application of riverstone stucco, which helps scatter the sound evenly. There is an additional double layer of straight drapes which are retractable. During orchestral performances, these drapes retract to expose the riverstone stucco, providing a better sound quality and a larger reverberation time. For performances that involve plays and musicals, the drapes are used as the primary sound absorptive surface. Controlling internal noises from HVAC equipment and ducts is critical for large spaces. As such, the ducts are large in sizes with thick layers of insulation around it. The mechanical equipment are kept in a sound insulated box that stand on a raised platform comprising of springs and neoprene surface which absorbs vibrations. Last but not least, mechanical room is situated in a different part of the building, which aids in further decreasing the noise of blowing air. Hammerson Hall strengths come in its adaptability in its acoustics features, flexible seating and stage arrangements allowing for various kinds of performances to be accommodated. When the orchestra pit is being used by the performers, the theatre can host 1,233 people. However, when the pit floor is raised through piston-driven lift, it can further accommodate up to 1,315 people. The hall takes on a rectangular form, but its architectural elements make it look as if it is curvilinear. The seating is arranged in a horse shoe arrangement, and the balconies on upper floors follow the same organization.

NORTH TORONTO COLLEGIATE INSTITUTE
CITY: ADDRESS: ACOUSTICS CONSULTANT: ARCHITECT: OWNER: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: Toronto, Ontario 17 Broadway Avenue HGC Engineering / Novita Techne CS+P Architects in association with Burka Architect Toronto District School Board $52,000,000 2010

THEATRE HISTORY
North Toronto Collegiate Institute (formerly known as North Toronto High School) was founded in 1910 in the old Town Hall. The institution began enrolling on 17 Broadway Avenue located east of Yonge Street in 1912. The two-storey building eventually doubled in size by 1921, renaming it North Toronto Collegiate Institute. The high school was constructed in the Collegiate Gothic style in 1912, following the Gothic Revival movement of other public institutions to signify the importance and formality of education in the early 20th century. In 2007, the deterioration of the old North Toronto Collegiate Institute forced Toronto District School Board to break ground for a new facility. In redeveloping the new high-performance, state of arts high school, Toronto Public District School Board teamed up with leading developer Tridel, selling 0.7 acre of land on site to fund the project. This unique partnership between the public and private development allowed two condominium towers to sit on top of the 4 storey, 14,500 m2 high school. North Toronto Collegiate Institute obtained a LEED Gold designation, achieving an energy efficient building that included a triple height 600-seater auditorium. As music and theatre represent an essential element of the school, the auditorium served as a theatrical and musical performance venue, designed as a "building within a building". Along with the fully equipped backstage wing, permanent acoustical shells are installed around the stage to allow students the opportunities to work with professional theatrical systems. The theatre occupies a large room with a 12 m ceiling height, located adjacent to the entrance of the school and directly beneath the private residential towers. The auditorium room was designed symmetrical with two flights of stairs on both sides of the room leading into upper balconies. Situated at the rear of the auditorium is a server control room that oversees the main level of the theatre, allowing the stage crew full control during musical or theatrical performances. The interior elevation includes fiberglass panels and a palate of wood strip paneling finishes. Underneath the controlled lighting of the auditorium around the acoustical shells, the overall quality of the performancse space is greatly enhanced.

School Board and Tridel, a private condominium The ceiling orientation ensures the greatest sound tower now sits directly on top of the school's propagation from the stage into the theatre. auditorium. As such, sound isolation between the two spaces became a critical concern, as the acoustic engineering team worked to minimize sound transfer into residential areas. Aside from acoustical provisions specified for the auditorium's interior finishes, special attention was also given to the mechanical rooms to prevent sound of amplified music to travel into residential suites. A second aspect of theatre isolation addressed the background sound of auditorium, including both the noise control of the mechanical system and background sound from exterior environments. Critical areas where sound breaching is most likely to occur such as vestibules, entrances and corridors are taken into special consideration. Sound reverberation is also accounted for in the designing of auditorium space in order to achieve the desirable reverberation time between 1.2 to 1.9 seconds in the mid-frequency range. The theatre is equipped with variable acoustical elements such as retractable wood paneling curtains to control reverberation. Fixed seating installed all around the theatre is padded with a foam fabric material to act as a sound absorbent, balancing the reverberation and reducing the dependency on the number of audiences during performances. The use of carpet for flooring is minimized in the theatre as the material is only effective in absorbing sound in the high frequency range; painted concrete is the dominant flooring material. Volumetrically, the aspect ratio of the auditorium is quite wide, providing two wings of balcony seating on the side to bring the audience closer to the stage. Along with the curved surfaces of the mezzanines and strips of acoustical shells overhanging as a ceiling finish of the theatre, sound produced from the stage is effectively reflected towards the audience, maximizing the acoustical performance of any events in the space. The auditorium is within the range of a medium sized performance space, with an approximate volume of 5,000 m3. It avoids the effect of excessive reverberation in a larger volume, and also does not suffer from excessive loudness of a smaller volume. The volume is further controlled within the theatre to adjust to an optimal volume per seat ratio through

OAKVILLE CENTRE FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS
CITY: ADDRESS: ACOUSTICS CONSULTANT: THEATRE CONSULTANT: ARCHITECT: OWNER: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: Oakville, Ontario 130 Navy Street Aerocoustics Engineering Limited Douglas Buck Alastair Grant, Ron Thom Partnership Architects Town of Oakville $1,800,000 1977

THEATRE HISTORY
In 1827, the Township of Oakville established itself as a simple commercial harbour. Over the years, the area's industries prospered and grew, resulting in the town and its population inherently growing in wealth and financial stability. Consequently, the community and municipality of Oakville had the resources to support a strong admiration for both culture and the arts. Creative expression and local funding became priorities within the community, leading to numerous successful organizations being established within the region. Oakville began to establish and fund a diverse range of performance organizations such as The Oakville Wind Orchestra, The English Church Theatre and The Oakville Symphony Orchestra. The growing demand for arts within the community saw the establishment of numerous local venues; the Agricultural Hall, Commin's Music Hall and Gregory Theatre all provided auditoriums for local performances, however, the community still saw the need for more. As a result of a diversified number of local organizations and a prosperous community capable of attracting larger professional performances, the municipality recognized the need for future development and plans for a new multipurpose space were formed. In 1973, Oakville's newly elected mayor, Mayor Harry Barrett, and the Town's board of councilors, began a movement to support funding for a new performing arts facility. In doing so, the Performing Arts Centre Committee was established. Design of the project was awarded to renowned Canadian firm Ron Thom Partnership. "A people place that is a theatre, a concert hall, an entertainment tool, a dance and opera house, a film theatre, a lecture hall...A performing arts centre must be all of these, but most of all it must be a warm, happy, busy place that is a pleasure to visit as an audience or to work in as a performer or a technician. Residents may be in the audience one night, and perhaps, on stage the next." (Opening Program, 1977) The 485 seat theatre rests along the banks of a water way that stretches inland from Lake Ontario. The theatre was designed in such a way as to maintain the intimacy and the ideals of a township. The Performing Arts Centre Committee agreed to develop a space that provides the flexibility and multi-use function of a multipurpose performance space. The theatre is designed to accommodate all performances, dance, theatrical, musical and spoken word. Along with the main auditorium, the performance centre contains a smaller 120 seat studio venue. Furthermore, the theater's design was also amalgamated into a larger community compound, including other facilities such as The Oakville Public Library, a public swimming pool and local art gallery. To this day, the theatre is still maintained and operated solely by the Township of Oakville. All performances, theatrical, instrumental or spoken are fashioned primarily by the citizens of the town itself. The Oakville Symphony Orchestra, currently conducted by Roberto De Clara, delivers performances roughly 12 times a year, theatre productions, such as Billy Bishop Goes to War, Hamlet and Nurse Jane Goes to Hawaii, sell tickets roughly 30 times a year and the rest of the year the theatre is occupied by small ensembles of artists and composers starting their journey in the life and spectrum of the arts.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
The ideal performance centre is one that allows a balance of properties such as reverberant time, clarity, spatial impressionism, intimacy and warmth. This is by no means a simple task, particularly for theaters like The Oakville Centre for the Performing Arts that are designed to accommodate a multipurpose program, and to support a variety of performance types with significantly varying acoustical needs. The Oakville Centre for the Performing Arts is a rather successful small theatre. The small stage and seating capacity for only 485 occupants within 16 m of the stage makes for an engaging performance and a theatrical environment that supports a strong sense of intimacy and spatial impressionism. These are important elements that help to enrich the acoustic quality of the space, forming a unique relationship between the performance and audience. The acoustical properties of the theatre are in support of spoken performances, allowing for one's voice to evenly propagate throughout the space. The size, configuration and material selection of both the stage and auditorium formulate a strong sense of clarity. Though the acoustic qualities of the space are rather good, the theatre does have its deficiencies in being a multipurpose space. Beyond spoken performances, the auditorium does face problems in supporting the acoustical demands of live music. According to an Acoustical Analysis conducted by Aerocoustics Engineering in June of 2008, it is the very qualities of the room that make it ideal for spoken performances. The issue becomes particularly evident for large live performances such as the Oakville Symphony Orchestra who performs approximately twelve annual shows and countless rehearsals in the space. Based on Aeroocustics Engineering analysis, the theater's roof is shallow for the scale of the performance. The other main concern with the space is the level of background noise. According to the theater's coordinators and audio technicians this has been an ongoing issue that the performance centre has dealt with over the years. These issues have been gradually addressed, however, the background noise formed by ambient and exterior sound transfer still require some levels of improvement. The Oakville Centre for the Performing Arts is a space intended to meet the needs and diversity of a community with a passion for the arts. Infact, the theater's multipurpose design allows for the space to be adaptable and evolve with a town that demands a place in support of its cultural needs.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
John Diamond and his firm, Diamond & Schmitt worked with acoustics consultant, Jaffe Holden to create a state of the art theater that houses 631 seats in its auditorium. Many key specifications were involved in the creation of an acoustically sound space utilized for performances amongst other uses that require such a space. All acoustic walls extend from slab to slab, and are sealed at the top, bottom and sides with nonhardening acoustic sealant. Sound attenuating batt insulation is provided in cavities of acoustic walls as required on the wall type definitions. All building structure that isolates air borne noise has to surround all critical spaces and noisy spaces. The effectiveness of sound isolating structures can be severely compromised by penetrations for ductwork and piping and conduit. Proper routing of and sealing and/or lagging (enclosure) around mechanical and electrical services penetrating these structures were necessary to maintain the integrity of the isolating structure. Vibration isolators are installed to attenuate the vibration transfer from equipment. As well, flexible connections are installed on the mechanical electrical equipment on vibration isolators to ensure complete isolation too. Doors with acoustical performance requirements all have full perimeter sound seals and door leaf density requirements with high STC sound rating requirements. The final, 610 mm x 1220 mm acoustic ceiling tiles were first constructed as a sample ceiling installation, 10 square meters in area, complete with perimeter wall trim. The sample was then modified as a standard of quality for the acoustical ceiling. The tiles are made up of mineral fibre with a standard suspension system. The acoustic panels suspended from the the walls of the auditorium are 25 mm thick density fibreglass with a fabric covering with an NRC 0.85 minimum performance. These panels are then covered with fabric covering taught, plumb and aligned horizontally and vertically with no sags, gaps, bowing and flexing.

SONY CENTRE FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS
CITY: ADDRESS: ACOUSTICS CONSULTANT: ARCHITECT: OWNER: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: RENOVATION COST: Toronto, Ontario 1 Front Street East Aerocoustics Engineering, Ltd. KPMB Architects City of Toronto $12,000,000 1960 (original), 1996 (renovation) $1,531,065

THEATRE HISTORY
Sony Centre for the Performing Arts is a multipurpose performing arts centre in the heart of Toronto. Located on Front Street between Yonge and Scott Streets, the 2.5 acre centre was built in 1960 at a total cost of $12 million, in which the project was initiated by O'Keefe Brewing Company. In 1968, ownership of the theatre was transferred to Metropolitan Toronto, and in 1968 was renamed the Hummingbird Centre for the Performing Arts after the sponsor of the theatre, Hummingbird Communications. SONY became the chief sponsor in 2007, and the name was changed to the present SONY Centre for the Performing Arts. A true landmark of Toronto, the modernist design of the threatre was completed by chief architects Earle C. Morgan and Peter Dickinson of Toronto's Page and Steel, with Eggers and Higgins of New York as architectural consultants and V.L. Henderson as the acoustician. The fan-shapes theatre was designed with a capacity of 3,200 seats on two levels facing an 18 metre wide proscenium stage. For band and orchestra performances, moveable panels on the walls of the theatre and an acoustic shell to be lowered from the stage tower was implemented in 1961, shortly after opening. Although the theatre was initially intentioned as a multi-purpose centre for drama, touring productions, ballet, and opera, the theatre's size and characteristics suited it for large scale productions. Electronic amplification was necessary until 1998, when a $600,000 digital enhancement system was installed to improve sound clarity and flexibility. The theatre opened on the 1st of October, 1960, with a pre-Broadway production of Camelot starring Julie Andrews, Richard Burton, and Robert Goulet. In 2008, the theatre closed for major renovations as the major tenants of the threate, the Canadian Opera Company, and the National Ballet of Canada had both moved to the newly-opened Four Seasons Centre. The facility reopened in October of 2010, exactly 50 years to the date of the original opening date. The work was led by architect Daniel Libeskind, who also designed the tall residential, colloquially referred to as the L-Tower, attached to the theatre. A large amount of the original features were preserved in the redesign, including The Seven Lively Arts mural by artist Ronald York Wilson, 189 solid brass doors, and 1,700 cherrywood panels. Major upgrades to the sound system, stage, seats, lobby, food amenities, and art gallery were also included in the renovation. Meant for use by Torontonians of all ages, ethnicities, and musical tastes, the vanue caters a wider range of productions than strictly Broadway musicals, the major act the theatre housed in the past. A second phase of improvements to the exterior landscape and connection to the urban environment is actually planned.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
When the O'Keefe Centre opened in 1960, it became one of the premier post-war theatres in Canada. In 1996, software developer Hummingbird Communications provided the theatre with a $5 million grant, and shortly thereafter became the namesake of the theatre. A portion of this grant was used to address the acoustical shortcomings of the theatre with the LARES electroacoustic enhancement system. The room is devoid of all late reflected energy and because of this is highly susceptible to echoing. One of the more pronounced echoes reflects off the side walls of the theatre. In the past, this was never a problem for the theatre as the fan-shaped walls reflected very little energy from the stage. The proposed electronic enhancement system included implementing 62 loudspeakers on both side walls. The design challenge of this theatre was enormous, as it is incredibly hard to introduce acoustical diffusers onto the flat, elegant side walls while still making it look like they belong. Three possible diffusers were proposed, each including a loudspeaker for the enhancement system, and were all based on prime number theory diffusion principles. The intention was to use a 0.3 x 1.2 metre grid lattice system with the diffusers being placed in the recesses of the side walls. Two were shaped as long right triangles with the loudspeaker located at one end, and the third as a flattened triangle with the loudspeaker in the middle. This third solution was the poorest diffuser, but was the best architectural solution for the theatre. Aerocoustics Engineering, Ltd., the acoustics consultant on the project, built a 1:48 test model calibrated to fullscale measurements of the threatre. All three diffusers were tested, and the model suggested the unwanted reflections could be significantly reduced. This problem was eventually solved with cresent-shaped acoustical diffusers designed and optimized by Trevor Cox using Boundary Element Modeling techniques. These diffusers were a perfect match for Daniel Libeskind's concept of a "basket-weave" that would weave in and out of the cherry wood-panelled side walls. Additionally, many of the diffusers were able to hide loudspeakers.

ST LAWRENCE CENTRE FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS
CITY: ADDRESS: ARCHITECT: OWNER: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: Toronto, Ontario 27 Front Street East Gordon S. Adamson and Associates City of Toronto $2,500,000 1970

THEATRE HISTORY
The St. Lawrence Centre for performing arts is a theatre complex located on Front Street in downtown Toronto. The Centre Provides Toronto's not-for-profit music, dance, and diverse cultural communities with a professional, service-oriented, and well-equipped theatrical and entertainment facility. The centre acts as a focus for Canadian performing arts by attracting, facilitating, and presenting various high quality cultural, artistic, and public events. In 1962 , The Toronto City fathers planned for a new $25,000,000 St. Lawrence Centre for the Performing Arts that would be deemed a lasting memorial of the 1967 Canadian Centennial year celebrations. Municipalities, communities, and organizations were encouraged to take part in Canada's 100th year anniversary . The construction and development of the Centre was originally driven by the vision of James Mavor Moore, who thrived to build a vibrant space to engage the civic and artistic imaginations of all Torontonians. The Toronto Planning Board initially proposed The St. Lawrence Centre to the Toronto City Council in 1962 in order to provide the city with a central hub that included centralized performance venues, rehearsal halls, schools, and gallery spaces. The St. Lawrence Centre Foundation, a committee of prominent businessmen was set up in late 1963 to review the proposal and carry out plans for the design. The proposed design was originally envisioned to occupy several blocks of land in the historic St. Lawrence market neighbourhood from Yonge St. to Jarvis St. The City's financial contribution to the project was conditional that the Toronto Arts Foundation would raise $4,800,000 from the public. The revised proposal envisioned two buildings: a theatre and a concert hall. After encountering some difficulties with funding, the theatre and concert hall proposal was redesigned, combining both venues into one building. Funding was finally approved for the Centre in 1968 and it was opened on the February 2, 1970. It houses two large auditoriums: the 483 seat Jane Mallet Town Hall and the 863- seat Bluma Appel Theatre. The theatre was renovated, in the early 1980s, with the generous support of Mrs Bluma Appel, a major patron of the arts, and was renamed in her honour. In addition, the Jane Mallet Theatre was renamed to commemorate the life and accomplishments of the late Canadian actress Jane Mallet, who founded the Actors Fund of Canada to help actors in financial need. A group of Mallet's friends organized a fundraising campaign to renovate the Town Hall. The Bluma Appel Theatre features state of the art sound and lighting capable of accommodating a wide range of presentations. In particular, the theatre is the ideal concert facility for musical presentations requiring both superb acoustics and an intimate setting. In 2007, the St. Lawrence Centre for Performing Arts Theatre revealed a new, modern look after a yearlong $3,000,000 renovation project. The modern, innovative design concept, by 3rd UNCLE Design, has updated and reinvigorated the St. Lawrence Centre to fit other modern cultural landmarks of Toronto while maintaining the original building design.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
Several alterations of the Jane Mallet stage occurred over the last 25 years. The stage consists of a semicircle platform against a solid back wall, with a full acoustic ceiling suspended overhead, which provides an optimal sound box. The technical support of this stage consists of a simple lighting system designed specifically for concert lighting. It is mainly comprised of overhead pot lights and frontal stage lights. When the public fundraising renovation campaign took place in 1982, the extra funds allowed for significant stage improvements in 1986. This included new seating installation and additional theatrical lighting capability, with the installation of increased dimming capacity of 96 channels and improved front of house lighting positions. By the 1990s, performing arts companies were looking to produce theatrical style productions in the Jane Mallet Theatre, and contemporary music producers required appropriate amplification for their bands and singers. However, the acoustical ceiling over the stage did not allow for the necessary on-stage theatrical lighting, or the hanging and changing of scenic backdrops and effects. The auditorium also lacked a live sound mixing facility and a suitable public address system. Consulting acoustic specialists provided a solution to the challenge of providing these facilities without affecting the acoustics or concert experience. The consultants proposed that eight feet of acoustic ceiling could be replaced by a removable acoustic baffle hinged to the back wall. The baffle could be raised to create an eight foot gap in the ceiling upstage, referred to as a fly space, and lowered to ensure the integrity of the acoustical ceiling for concerts. Once completed, it became possible to install a set of motorized flying pipes from the roof of the theatre that could support, raise, and lower various backdrops as well as an upstage lighting truss. This lighting truss also contained articulated arms that could be swung out over the stage, under the rest of the acoustical ceiling, to connect to the new motorized pipe hanging over the front stage which provides a complete overhead lighting grid.

YOUNG CENTRE FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS
CITY: ADDRESS: ACOUSTICS CONSULTANT: ARCHITECT: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: Toronto, Ontario 50 Tank House Lane Aercoustics Engineering Ltd Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects $10,000,000 2006

THEATRE HISTORY
The Young Centre for the Performing Arts (YCPA) is an outcome of a restoration project reusing previously known buildings tank houses 9 and 10 in the Distillery District. Designed by Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects (KPMB) for George Brown College and Soulpepper Theatre Company, the building combines live performances with a teaching facility. On June 15, 2006, YCPA officially opened to public, and respected the industrial heritage site. The total area of approximately 4,000 m2 the building embodied dynamic design both maximized the building use, and spaces for performances and teaching. Open lobby at the entrance provides a space that can be accessed by public throughout the day, where all the users of the building converge. Small café, box office, bookstore and furniture encourage the use of the space that acts as an informal gathering. The overall design respects that historical fabric of the site with exposed brick façade and utilitarian concrete interior. It coexists between separate times, and function, which was achieved through a strict budget . As mentioned earlier, the building is located within Distillery District that is buildup of revitalized industrial buildings, well known for its entertainment and retail possibilities. YCPA design was inspired through brick warehouses of the 19th century. Material intervention within the building was limited to respect its historical aspects of tank houses 9 and 10. Furthermore, the ceilings were designed exposed to meet the cost limitation and functional requirements. YCPA includes five theatres; seats ranging from 80 to 400, six rehearsal and teaching studios, three classrooms, costume shop, administration offices, café, and an outdoor garden. Prior to its construction, the tank houses existed with their original flooring, and now they are linked together. There are large Douglas Fir beams spanning across bearing walls of the tank houses, creating an open gathering space in between, defining the entrance to the multifunctional facility. The focus of this project is the largest theatre within YCPA, Marilyn & Charles Baillie Theatre. It incorporates orchestra and balcony seating, and its configuration can be transformed into either thrust or arena format within two days. It consists of dressing rooms, film screening options, sound/lighting board, tech booth, and full theatrical lighting and sound.

Previously known as tank houses 9 and 10, once functional storage spaces for alcohol, the YCPA brings new program to the historic site of Distillery District. Furthermore, Marilyn & Charles Bailie Theatre, largest theatre of YCPA, was built specifically to allow functional possibilities. It seats up to 378 people at its maximum capacity, with up to 1 m distance from the stage it provides close intimacy with the performance. It can be arranged in either arena or thrust format depending on the hosted program. In addition, it consists of both orchestra and balcony seating. Materiality of the overall building provides a warm industrial feel that respects the historic fabric of the previous buildings. The theatre uses pre-existing brick load bearing wall, exposed concrete ceiling, and wood planked balconies to provide a natural feel within the space. In addition, the stage is centred at the front, providing clear view to audience.

CITY: ADDRESS: ACOUSTICS CONSULTANT: ARCHITECT: OWNER: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: North York, Ontario 5040 Yonge Street ARTEC Consultants Inc. Zeidler Partnership Architects City of Toronto $40,000,000 1993

THEATRE HISTORY
Located in Midtown Toronto, the Toronto Centre for the Arts was previously known as the Ford Centre for the Performing Arts, and opened its doors in 1993 as the North York Centre of the Arts. The Centre was owned by the Toronto based theatre company, Livent Inc. In the year of 2009 it was renamed the "Toronto Centre of the Arts" and was then taken over by the city of Toronto. The Centre of the arts houses The George Weston hall, The Apotex Theatre, and the Studio Theatre. The George Weston Hall is considered to be one of the best Recital Halls in Canada. The project was completed in late 1993. The entire Arts Centre spans over an area of 20,250 m2, while the George Weston Hall itself covers an area of 3,700 square meters. The George Weston Recital Hall, along with the entire Toronto Centre of the Arts cost a total of $40,000,000 and is owned by the city of Toronto. Designed by Zeidler Partnership Architects, the rectangular form creates the perfect acoustical conditions and is thus renowned for its exceptional acoustics. With three different Levels; Orchestra, Dress Circle, and Lodge, the G.W Recital Hall has a total of 1,036 seats. Located in the busy mid town of Toronto the entire outside envelope of the building was constructed to reduce and prohibit outside noise. Also in order to provide the hall with adequate ventilation, a special ventilation system was installed. Each individual seat is provided with an air supply which has acoustically lined plenums and allows air to flow through silent air terminals. The acoustics was design by the ARTEC Consultants Inc. Every design decision in the interior of the G.W Recital hall was meticulously chosen to optimize the acoustical conditions. These conditions allow for a variety of genres from recitals, group orchestras, to choral concerts. The retractable concert walls all consist of acoustic panels which are adjustable to allow for adequate sound absorption and diffusion. Above the maple wood performance stage is also a fixed plaster reflector and acoustic velour curtains. A green room is located at the end of the hall in the centre of the room. Behind the Green room are located all major artist dressing rooms which are equipped with mirrors, lights, and washrooms. The George Weston Recital hall houses many events from Opera's, group orchestras, to theatrical performances every year.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
The George Weston Recital Hall first opened its doors to the public in late 1993. Vienna's Grosser Musikvereinsaal and also Amsterdam's Concertgebouw inspired the Recital Hall's design. With its 1,036 seats and its stage, which spans 16 meters in width and 10 meters in depth, Dame Kiri Janette Te Kanawa was the Soprano that first performed in the Recital Hall when it opened. Artec Consultants worked with Zeidler Partnership Architects to achieve this acoustic masterpiece by designing very effective isolation for the hall's exterior shell, sealing it from external noises. One of the very first steps the ARTEC Consultants undertook was the analysis of the background noise within the designated space, and the desired acoustic quality. The study of the noise of the environment surrounding the building resulted in the specifications and suggestions of the buildings isolation. Once the building shell was designed to best serve the interior, the latter's specifications came into place. The design of the space then began depending on the room's function. The G.W Recital Hall being both a performance and recital room, the space needed to be able to adjust itself to a variety of acoustical repertoires. The acoustic consultants modeled the G.W Recital hall with regards to having both a large space with excellent acoustic qualities that also felt cozy and intimate to the public. To achieve the excellent acoustics not only did the consultants meticulously insulate the walls of the hall, but they also used wood panels around the stage area and in the audience chamber allow for optimal listening conditions and prevent absorption of the lower frequency sounds. These specifications and also allowed for sounds that are below the threshold of hearing to be perfectly amplified. The Recital hall having a rectangular form also greatly enhanced its acoustics as it provided the room with clarity and strength to the sound. Other design choices such as the fixed canopy over the stage, velour adjustable curtains, and maple wood flooring all allowed for adjustable natural reverberance in the room. All the mechanical and sound spaces were purposely placed around the recital hall. A special ventilation system was installed to allow for air to flow under the seats for more comfort for the audience but also for its silent qualities.

GLENN GOULD STUDIO
CITY: ADDRESS: ACOUSTICS CONSULTANT: ARCHITECT: OWNER: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: Toronto, Ontario 250 Front Street West Neils Jordan & HGC Acoustical Engineering Philip Johnson & John Burgee Architects Canadian Broadcast Corporation $350,000,000 1992

THEATRE HISTORY
Located within the Canadian Broadcasting Centre Building on Front St West and designed by renowned post-modern architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee, The Glenn Gould Studio serves both the purposes of a musical performance theatre and a radio-recording studio for live events. Neils Jordan of Denmark, who had experience in Stockholm and Vienna, designed the acoustical components of the theatre. Celebrating the famous Canadian pianist Glenn Gould, the theatre was named after him as tribute for recording classical music. Before Gould's death in 1982, he gave up performing publicly and became interested in recording in a studio to leave behind a legacy. Completed in 1992, ten years after the death of Gould, the theatre withholds 341 seats. Before the theatre studio was built, CBC often rented other theatre locations and recorded with mobile trucks. With many scattered buildings across Toronto, CBC was give the opportunity to propose a unified building, serving as both office and production in the late 1980's. The main purpose of the Glenn Gould Studio was CBC's demand for a unique base for recording classical music with the side usage of a performance hall.  The design of the theatre space was heavily influenced by the traditional shoe-box design used in classic European concert hall combined with new ornamentation and a Post Modern touch. The initial intent of the room was to be a reverberant room used for chamber music. However, through out time the theatre manage to accommodate multiple programs and genres of music. A significant space of the theatre was the stage which all the performance and recordings takes place. In the initial uses of the theatre after it opened, the director pointed out the microphones captured a loud buzzing sound from the stage. The maintenance team later discovered that it was caused by a barn door on a light above the stage. As a result, the light was slight moved and was mounted to a grid on the ceiling. In honouring the legendary pianist, the theatre continues to serve as an ideal acoustical environment for classical, jazz performances and recordings for both local and international musicians.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
Glenn Gould Studio was designed with the framework of "isolation", both architecturally and acoustically. The studio, located within the CBC building, is almost completely isolated using neoprene pucks that sits on the layer of bedrock below. This was furthermore used to isolate external sounds such those from the subway lines and the CN tower. The only functional components that the studio shares with building are the HVAC ducts and electrical conduits. In addition the architect chose to oversize the duct members so they don't require as much power to pump the air around and thus reduce noise. The walls themselves are very thick and are composed of; 4 layers of drywall, absorptive material, another 4 layers of drywall, and then the structural components. It was these features that allowed the studio to achieve a NC-12 rating. To control the reverberation times, the studio walls are covered with sound baffles in the corners, behind the stage, and along the sides. Furthermore, absorptive tubes were added to each of the four walls to allow control depending on the performance type. These tubes are removable which allows a set reverberation time. The structures are cladded in plaster which helps to mediate the reflection of sound moving around the room. With the addition of sound absorptive curtains, the studio was just recently able to hold other types of music such as rock, pop, jazz. Initially the architect designed the space for chamber music, as other types of instruments would reverberate too long within the studio. The overall space and texture quality is designed to absorb and diffuse sound, even the flat surfaces such as on the doorways are divided into smaller sections and angles. The studio uses several different systems to achieve its acoustical characteristics. The main speaker systems for the PA and the monitors feature EAW enclosures. In addition, many times clients use their own a system which allows for a flexible change when required. A sound-craft GB-8 console is located in the balcony and a Spirit is at the monitor position, which provides necessary inputs. The stage is comprised of wooden curved members above the stage that amplifies and sends the sound back to the viewers. Speakers are located in front of the wooden members that are part of the PA system.

Starting with a shoebox configuration, the designers chose a mid-sized stage, with a section in front that moves up and down serving as a stage extension or an orchestra pit. The hall features two balcony tiers above the main orchestra level, and a third technical balcony. Inside, the hall feels intimate and warm, dominated by honey-coloured oak. A sense of enclosure is created by the curved lines of balcony fronts and side aisles.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
Lateral Reflections The hall's narrow and tall shape provides early lateral reflections which leads to source broadening. It also provides strong late lateral energy contributing to envelopment. To provide warmth, the balconies have soffits which provide reflections from the sides at precise angles. In addition, the fire exits also draw out lateral reflections. Sound System The two functions of the sound system are speech reinforcement and amplified music, achieved by the "Voice-stick" and "Main Cluster" respectively. The small and innovative `voice-stick' maximizes intelligibility, while two loudspeaker clusters are used solely for amplified sound. Of the two loudspeakers, the Main Cluster is centre-mounted for main sound reinforcement. Sound Releasing Doors Hidden panels in the walls open to release noise if a performance gets too loud. Seats The seats have minimal upholstery, and oak bottoms designed to reflect as much sound as possible. Floors The framing below the subfloor is designed with air space throughout to enhance the resonance of the low string instruments. The Baillie Veil Twisted and bowed oak strands form the backdrop for the chorus at the first balcony level, then hover over the stage 7 meters below the fixed acoustic canopy, and extend into and over the hall at the technical balcony level. They make the hall more visually intimate, hide all lighting and other technical gear, and guide sound waves evenly to all the patrons in the space. They also reflect a precise amount of sound back towards the stage so that musicians can hear themselves without having to rely on speakers or amplification. The ribbon-like forms allow low and mid-frequency sound waves to pass unobstructed through to the higher ceiling, while scattering the highest frequency harmonics throughout the concert hall. Plaster Walls Gray waves of solid plaster, with a rough finish are bonded to masonry and form a large portion of the walls. The solidity supports the bass, the hardness supports the mid-range, the waves scatter the middle frequencies, and the roughness scatters the highest frequencies. The boards on the front of the balcony have a slight convex curve, as well as shallow grooves in their surfaces. Those grooves scatter higher frequencies, mitigating any harshness in the sound. Acoustic Isolation An acoustic joint surrounds the room on all sides, shielding Koerner Hall from any vibrations from adjacent structures. The structure floats on 250 thick rubber pads that isolate it from the subway which is almost directly below, and from noisy chillers for the hockey arena next door. Lighting, Air Conditioning And Ventilation Electronic ballasts, which regulate the electrical current for the hall's lighting, are located beyond the acoustic barrier. The ducts for HVAC are very wide in diameter, which helps keep the ventilation system silent. Dampening Effects For amplified events, the loudspeakers are exposed and the acoustic curtains are extended to absorb sound more quickly, reducing the reverberation and increasing the clarity of the audio.

MASSEY HALL
CITY: ADDRESS: ACOUSTICS CONSULTANT: ARCHITECT: OWNER: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: Toronto, Ontario 178 Victoria Street Doug Mc Kendrick Sidney Badgley The Corporation of Massey Hall + Roy Thomson Hall $152,390 1894

THEATRE HISTORY
Massey Hall is one of key venues in Canada. It has attracted many celebrities and audiences for more than a hundred twenty years which places this venue in the National Historic Site of Canada since June 15, 1981 and Ontario Heritage Act since 1975. The hall was once constructed and owned by the Massey foundation, when it later on joined the Roy Thomson hall. In 1892 Hart Massey purchased a land at the edge of shutter and Victoria. He hired Architect Sidney R. Badgley in order to design Massey hall as memorial to his son in form of a venue where people of Toronto can use its space for conventions, musicals and other entertainments. By June 14 1894, Massey musical hall was completed with the cost of $152,390. The venue had a capacity of 3500 seats, a large arch was constructed on top of its stage that performed as an amplifier and was inspired by seashells. The material used to construct the roof of this historical and monumental hall is Horsehair and stucco. Later on, in 1917, with Massey Hall gaining fame in the city, its events increased numerously. The Albert Building that is neighbouring the Massey Hall was connected to the hall as an expansion in order to accommodate as a dressing rooms and offices. During 1933 the hall enjoys a major renovations. A new lounge was created behind its gallery, the ground floor entrance area was enlarged to accommodate larger amount of crowds, the flammable wooden stairs were replaced with stone and steel in order to reduce the risk of fire, a new art deco appearance was introduced in the interior as a well as the exterior of the building in order to update the image. Most importantly, the capacity of seats was reduced from 3,500 to 2,675. In 1948, after many concerns over the fire safety of this hall, it lead to the installation of concrete under the stage and ground floor seating. The concrete affected the acoustics of the hall which lead to introduction of carpet through out the building in order to absorb sound. Furthermore in 1955 a large part of the stucco ceiling dropped off and caused the whole ceiling to be replaced and reinforced with a strong wire mesh to hold it in place. In January 23, 2012 Toronto's MOD Developments announce that 4804 square foot portion of land fronting on Victoria St. will be donated to Massey Hall. By 2013, Massey Hall corporation decided to Revitalize Massey hall using the received land. The Revitalization will take place in two components. The first component started in 2013 and it is planned to be completed in 2017. The first component contains the removal of The Albert Building in order to create additional space for expansion plans, including a modernized back of house and backstage artist space, construction of technical and production facilities, modern mechanical and electrical infrastructure. The second component is intended to start in 2018 and end in 2020. This component consists of refurbishment of the interior and exterior of Massey Hall and an expansion above the new foundation of two levels of enhanced, accessible patron amenities, which will include elevators, new washrooms, and lobby, bar and hospitality/rental spaces.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
During 1894 when the Massey hall was first opened to public, it was one of the only halls that were constructed in order to accommodate Torontonians for public entertainments and events. Architect Sidney R. Badgley designed an arch behind the stage¸. The arch carried the sounds from the stage and amplified it through the venue, allowing the audience to hear the performer clearly but more amplified. The Arch is constructed out of a dense cast in place concrete with a smooth surface allowing for high reflection of sound with low absorption in order for the sound to be projected to the audience without damping and distortion. This was successful for it own period of time which caused this hall to gain attention and the legendary status through out the halls of Toronto. However, due to birth of electronic devises, the need of the arch has become obsolete being replaced by loudspeakers for a better, clearer, controllable and more defined sound. The arch is no longer an advantage but it has become a flaw. In order to solve some issues, an 18 oz/s fabric molleton curtain dropped from the main ceiling to the ceiling covering the gallery level was introduced. This curtain is draped in a wrinkled pattern creating an uniformed shape that causes the sound deflected back and forth causing a flutter echo between the wall and its self while it is absorbing a part of the sound with its porous texture. In 1980s, low frequency sounds were one of the most important sounds in orchestra. This convinced the architect to utilise certain materials that absorb high frequency sounds. According to Doug Mc Kendrick, Tech Director, production manager, with all the benefits the hall has, it has some flaws due to its obsolete architectural design. He said, the Hall allows no control over the sound since they cannot install any modern acoustic insulators such as adaptable curtain and acoustic panel due to it being a heritage building. Interestingly, Massey Hall contains no sound system other than a small Public Address system, Sound systems are brought in on a show-to-show basis. There are Rigging points for a center cluster or a Left/Right hang but both can not be used at the same time.

MAZZOLENI HALL TELUS CENTRE FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS
CITY: ADDRESS: ACOUSTICS CONSULTANT: ARCHITECT: OWNER: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: RESTORATION DATE: Toronto, Ontario 273 Bloor Street West Artec Consultants Kuwubara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects The Royal Conservatory of Music $2,200,000 1901 1997

THEATRE HISTORY
Mazzoleni Hall is one of the performing spaces that belongs to the TELUS center for performance and learning complex. The building is located in Ihnatowycz Hall on Bloor Street and close to University Avenue. Originally known as the Castle Memorial Hall, it was designed in 1901 by Burke and Harwood. They were characterized by their interest in Romanesque revival architecture. The building was firstly used as a Baptist Chapel, until the 1960s when the University of Toronto acquired the building as a lecture hall. The change in program also meant a change in its aesthetics: the windows were covered with brick and an interior balcony, on the north side, was removed. In 1996, a plan to revitalize the building began and Joanne Mazzoleni, who is Ettore Mazzoleni's widow, financially promoted it. This proposal was undergone by the local architects KPMB and consisted of opening up the windows, cleaning up the paint on the brick walls, adding the raked floor to allow the 237 seats to have a good view of the stage, restoring the wood, installing proper heating and air conditioning, building the acoustic panels, and enlarging the stage to be more flexible. The latter provides enough space to fit a full symphony orchestra. The architects aimed for keeping the historic context and relevance of the building, while making contemporary changes. For instance, modern electric chandeliers were installed so that it creates a dim atmosphere while highlighting the historic roof' trusses. The lower floors were transformed to practice rooms and children's area. With the renovations, the hall was renamed to honor the conservatory's former principal for 23 years, Ettore Mazzoleni. He was a conductor who was highly interested in the proliferation of the arts. This can be seen by his involvement in different fields as director of the Opera Division of the University of Toronto and his participation at the Toronto Conservatory of Music. It was him who envisioned an evolution for the conservatory when he planned the expansion of the hall in 1968. Mazzoleni Hall, along the other buildings within the conservatory, was included to the national heritage list in 1995 because of the design of the whole complex, the key elements interior plans, the revitalizations without altering the historic value, and anything that contributes to the improvement to the teaching of music in the city. The Royal Conservatory was founded in 1886, but it had been affiliated to the University of Toronto from 1963 to 1991, when it became independent. Part of the success of the conservatory to the education, and growth of the institution is due to the "purpose-built structure" with the expansion of spaces for performing and practicing.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
Since the Hall's changes in uses, the acoustics was often a concern for the performance space. With its pitched roof, it provides a larger volume for the sound to reverberate. The angle of the roof provides better quality of sound because it bounces in all directions, thus allowing the high and low frequencies to mix and to reach to seats evenly. The shape of the 237 seats affects the sound quality by the absorption of sound through the fabric and cushioning. The latter was designed for the less absorption of sound when the space is not fully occupied. The positioning of the seats is placed according to the hall's off-centre aisles. Each section, right and left, of the seats have different considerations for the sound. Since the building is located on a busy street, triple glazed windows were used, so that the noise coming from the street is unperceivable. In order to achieve high acoustical quality, the structural elements add depth to the room. The walls' and ceiling's heaviness of material "reflect the sound energy for maximum return". While the rough surfaces, like the brick, add acoustic diffusion, making the sound distribute equally since all the perimeter of the inner walls use this material. The brick used became more porous when the renovations began. As for low frequencies absorption, it is through the heavy timber for the trusses and any other pronounced elements. The main focus of the hall was to minimize the outdoor noise from the main streets; triple glazed windows with 152 mm air space were placed on the east side, the roof was as well insulated, combination of heavy material with light insulation for stopping and absorbing sound. The slates on the roof has also improved the acoustics absoption The stage and seating floor uses heavy wood so the weight and air space provide softer reflection of reverberation.

THEATRE HISTORY
Roy Thomson Hall (1982 - 2002) was a concert hall designed to house the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, and the Toronto Medelssohn Choir. Funded by key partners, Pierre Trudeau, David Crombie, Paul Godfrey, and William Davis in 1977, the Hall was built in the fall of 1982 at a cost of $57,000,000. With a generous donation by the Thomson Family of $4,500,000, the Hall was named after Roy Herbert Thomson. The hall is located on the block between Wellington, Simcoe, and King Streets, and boasts a generous 2.5 acre site. In 2002, the hall was renovated to improve the acoustics, transforming it into a world class concert hall and multi-purpose facility. The hall was originally designed by architects Arthur Erickson/Mathers and Haldenby, and acoustician Theodore J. Schultz of Bolt, Beranek and Newman Inc. The renovation project that took place in 2002 was lead by Thomas Payne of KPMB Architects, with acoustical aid by Russel Johnson of Artec Consultants Inc. The $24,000,000 project intended to enhance the acoustical performance of the hall, as well as provide increased comfort and versatility, rivaling world class halls. The hall features an iconic curvilinear honeycombed glass canopy which encases the lobby and auditorium within. Prior to the renovation the hall had a seating capacity of more than 2800 people, but following the renovation the seating was lowered to 2600 to create a more intimate experience. Within the auditorium, acrylic sound reflectors were used to reflect sound throughout, but with the renovation these were removed and replaced by two adjustable wooden canopies, that could manoeuvre to provide optimal sound reflection depending on the use. The hall was retrofitted to accommodate modern performances, including digital enhancements (large high resolution projector screens), and improved sound systems, while also providing incredible features for more traditional performances. Roy Thompson Hall originally opened on September 13, 1982 housing its inaugural gala concert with performances from the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, The Toronto Mendelssohn Choir, Lois Marshall, The Canadian Opera Company and more. Throughout the years the auditorium was graced by many performers and esteemed guests, while hosting competitions (International Bach Competition), festivals (TIFF), ceremonies (International Economic Summit), and more. The renovation in 2002 signified the change in the halls programming, and brought in a variety of different uses to the auditorium such as live television (The Golden Jubilee Gala, a live to air CBC Television event featuring a mix of uses including Bands, Orchestras, Quartets and more). Since 2002, further renovations came to fruition following the success of the reinvigorated Roy Thomson Hall. In 2004, a newly constructed donor lounge was completed. The renovations also spurred written work about the story of Roy Thomson Hall and its impact on the city of Toronto and Canadians as a whole through its design, programming, and prestige throughout the world.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE

When Roy Thomson Hall opened in 1982, it was recognized for its innovative design, and generous size. The spherical concrete hall had a seating capacity of 2,812 people located on the main floor, mezzanine pods and balconies. The acoustics were controlled by adjustable reflective acrylic discs which suspended over the stage area and fabric banners that could be retracted. The Hall was critically panned for its blunt The acoustic bulkheads are constructed of 127 mm aesthetics and cold acoustics.
