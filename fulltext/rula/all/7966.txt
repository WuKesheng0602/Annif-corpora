THEATRE HISTORY
In celebration of the 50th anniversary of the province of Alberta, the Jubilee Auditoria was built in 1955. The project was designed as twin buildings located in two different cities; one in Calgary and the other in Edmonton. They were gifts from the government of Alberta for the people in order to support Alberta's cultural activities and allow for the creation of memorable interaction between the people. At the time, the building was designed with state of the art acoustic technology and the best knowledge of the time. However, several acoustic problems have arose throughout the years that needed to be addressed. In 2001, the government decided to renovate the Alberta Jubilee Auditoria and bring it back up to date and ready for the 100th anniversary of the province of Alberta in 2005. Canadian architect, Fred Valentine, principal at Stantec Architects, collaborated with a Danish acoustic company, Jordan Akustik, for the renovation project. The original auditorium was a wide fan shape, with two balconies and seating capacity of 2800. The ceiling was design to create early reflections directed to the audience in order to create relatively dry acoustics. From certain test, they found that the EDT was short in the back of the auditorium and long in the front section. The halls were designed to be for a range of multipurpose activites, ranging from graduations, to musicals, to rock shows and many more. Therefore, it was necessary for the auditorium to have a flexible acoustic environment. The goal was to achieve opera acoustic standards for the 2005 renovation. The architect and acoustic professionals began with identifying many of the standard acoustic problems. They identified that the reverberation time was too shoes, the distribution of EDT was very uneven in the back and rear of hall, the clarity was very uneven, the strength was too low for nonamplified music, the force level was too low, and major echo problems existed. The intimacy of the theatre and sight lines were rather poor as well, especially in the two balconies. In order to solve these problems, architectural changes were made to the auditorium. The original fan-shaped hall was rearranged using the shoebox form. Terraced seating which descended from the first floor was implemented which create earlier sound reflections thus improving the sound quality of the room and sightlines. Additional volume above

a transparent ceiling was placed in the from of the room to increase reverberation. The wall panels were also removed and sound diffusing structure were added to the back to prevent drum-like sound conditions and angles to create more even sound distributions. The flat brown colour of the wall panels were also stripped and refinished with a reddishbrown hue to emphasize the grain and create the feeling of warmth within the building. As a multipurpose theatre, the audience chamber adapts to the different type of performance to create both live and dry acoustics. Retractable curtains are hung on sidewalls. The old plaster ceiling in the front half of the auditorium was removed to allow sound to travel to the underside of the roof structure to provide long reverberation. Acoustic ceiling panels are installed. Adjustable ceiling drapes are also available to provide sound absorption. The old HVAC system was very poor with mechanical system noise, stale air, drafts and inefficiency. Diffusers in the audience chamber now provide fresh conditioned air through low velocity ducts that create less noise. Operating cost and energy efficient were also improved with the improved system.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
The design team utilized the ODEON room acoustic modelling software to help them with acoustic calculations throughout the project. Different wall configurations, seating layouts and acoustic banners and ceiling voids were tested before finally arriving at the final results. The audience hall was remodelled for improved sound quality and spatial experience. The reverberation time and EDT was increased significantly and became more evenly distributed throughout the audience area. The reveration time is now 1,7 s at mid frequencies and up to 2,2 at low frequencies. This reached their design goal of opera standards (1,6-2,2s). The clarity of the hall was reduced as reverberation increased. The clarity became more uniform and also reached a good level for opera. The strength was also increased by 1,6 dB compared to the original hall, which was a significant improvement. Lateral sound was improved to create a better feeling of intimacy with the new seating arrangement. The Alberta Jubilee Auditoria was reopened in August 2005, for the 100th anniversary of Alberta. The new renovation was a huge success! Using computer acoustic modelling technology, Stantec Architects and Jordan Akustik was able to significantly improve the sound and experiential qualities of the theatre.

THEATRE HISTORY
Located at the heart of Calgary's cultural district, the Art Commons complex occupies an entire city block containing five theatres. Included amongst this group is the Jack Singer Concert Hall, which is the largest within the complex and considered to be one of North America's most beautiful and acoustically successful venues. Home to the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra, the entire complex covers a total ground floor area of 52087.5 sqm spread over six storeys and hosts over 1800 events annually. Containing enough seats to accommodate 1800 audience members, the theatre also has an additional 200 seats for choir members. With such an immense scale for public performances, Art Commons is considered one of the three largest art centres in Canada. Along with concert halls and theatres, it also encompasses two existing heritage buildings, the Berns Building (ca. 1917) and the Calgary Public Building (ca. 1931). Previously, the site was also the location of the Empress Theatre which was demolished to make room for complex. In the early 1970's the citizens of Calgary yearned for improved performance spaces and to respond to this public requirement, a committee of the Calgary Region Arts Foundation developed a feasibility study in 1976. This became the initial stage towards the concert halls conception. The monetary funds raised for the building was produced from a joint venture between private partners and government entities. $11.3 million was raised from the private sector, including a $1.5 million contribution by Alan and Stephen Singer, the sons of the Canadian real estate developer and arts patron, Jack Singer. $2.5 million was received from the Canadian Federal Government, another $48.7 million by the Province of Alberta, and $12.7 million from the City of Calgary. Along with all the donations, the municipal and provincial government contributed to a fixed annual operating grant of $2.4 million. Of the final construction cost of $102.4 million, $75.2 million was covered by generous donations. A local Calgary architectural firm called Raines, Finlayson Barrett and Partners were hired by the committee to design the Arts Complex, including the Jack Singer

Concert Hall. To design the spaces, they worked alongside Richard Pilbrow, a UK based theatre design consultant, Theatre Projects Consultants Ltd from New York, as well as Russell Johnson and Artec Consultants Ltd who were noted for designing the suspended timber clad acoustical canopy. They were also responsible throughout the pre-design phase and provided expertise towards auditorium acoustics design as well as input towards background noise reduction and vibration control. The concert hall was designed as a long, narrow `shoebox' shaped sound chamber in order to mimic the Musikvereinsaal of Vienna, known as one of the finest concert halls in the world. Construction phase of the Arts Complex began in 1981 and in a short four year process, the doors were open to the public on September 4th, 1985. In August of 2004, the hall was renovated in order to accommodate an upgraded million dollar sound system and an ultramodern hearing assistance system. In addition to the new sound system, microphones, speakers, monitors, and audience headsets were also replaced and upgraded for the enjoyment of the users. Ten years later, in 2014, all outdated soundboards were replaced with current technology in order to achieve the best possible acoustic experience for the audience. The City of Calgary purchased the building in 1979 for $3.8 million and the upper portion of the structure contains offices for the city to this day. In May 2001, the Arts Commons received a donation by EPCOR, an Alberta-based Utilities Company, causing the building to change its name to the EPCOR Centre for the Performing Arts. The new title remained until in 2014 when at a Annual General Meeting it was publicly announced that it was going to be rebranded as the Arts Commons. `Arts' referred to the expanded programs which the complex offered besides performance arts and `Commons' was an allusion to the old town square concept where a diverse assembly of citizens gathered to exchange influential ideas.

The Jack Singer Concert Hall implements other adjustable features such as the interior walls which are designed with acoustic banners and drapes that can be manipulated to meet the desired audio output required by musicians. Based on the traditional but effective `shoebox' style music halls, the dimensions of the acoustical space are 46.3m by 26.8m, with a relatively large central stage that is 26 metres wide and 11.5 metres deep. With these dimensions, the space is able to accommodate seating for up to 2021 people which is somewhat modest compared to other large-scale music halls. For this reason, it has been criticized by some as too small but has also received praise for its exceptional acoustic qualities. What makes for such effective sound quality is in fact its smaller volume as it therefore allows for less reverberation time. In terms of viewing, the space acomodates an array of seating locations, including central floor seating, four side mezzanines, three rear mezzanines and a large balcony which sits overtop. All seating locations have direct lines of sight to the stage thus allowing sound to travel directly to the audience. The mezzanine spaces also have vertical surfaces directly behind the seating so that the reflected sound reaches the audience instantaneously. In order to function effectively as a versatile performance space, the Jack Singer Concert Hall has been designed to accommodate a variety of performance styles as well as a wide range of acoustic configurations. The space is designed in order to adhere to performances that are both electronically reinforced and those that are not. Technological instruments that allow for this are stereo speaker arrays that

THEATRE HISTORY
THE CITADEL HISTORY Founded in 1965, the Citadel Theatre, located in Edmonton Alberta, is the largest non-for-profit theatre in North America. Joseph H. Shoctor, James L. Martin, Ralph B. MacMillan, and Sandy Mactaggart bought over the Salvation Army Citadel on 102 Street. After $150,000 in renovations of the building, the 277 seat original theatre opened on October 12th 1965. Their very first performance, opening on November 10th of the same year was Edward Albee's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?The Citadel Theatre engages crew members, front of house staff and actors from the International Alliance of Theatrical Employees and the Canadian Actors' Equity Association. This makes The Citadel Theatre both a not-for-profit association and a professional theatre company. Every year The Citadel donates several hundred tickets towards fundraising activities and also annually collects and donates food to the Edmonton Food Bank. As most regional theatres, the mainstage program for The Citadel has been both classic and contemporary hits as well as including some local Canadian pieces. Some artistic directors pushed for more original pieces, ones that would be able to move on to New York or London. The Citadel is a registered not-for-profit organization and receives funding through grants, sponsorships, donors and ticket sales. The theatre puts on 9 performances and entertains over 110,000 people each season. Over the years The Citadel has been host to several programs over the years. Currently they are working with The Citadel/Banff Centre Professional Theatre Program, Young Companies, The Eldon and Anne Foote Theatre School and Play Development. This adds a learning aspect and a more community driven edge to the theatre.

THE NEW CITADEL THEATRE
In 1973, Joe Shoctor began fundraising for a new facility for the theatre. Designed by Barton Meyers Associates, with R.L. Wilking as architect, construction of the new theatre broke ground in December of 1974. The new facility was built in 3 phases between 1974 and 1989. In total, the building houses five performance spaces. The performance spaces are the Shoctor Theatre, the Maclab Theatre, The Club, Zeidler Hall and the Tucker Amphitheatre. The Shoctor Theatre, the one that will be analyzed acoustically within the rest of this paper, is a proscenium stage and is the second largest theatre within the building. The largest, the Maclab Theatre, is a thrust stage and holds 682 audience members. Also known as the Rice Theatre, The Club is a smaller cabaret style venue that holds around 250 audience members with flexible seating to encourage experimental theatre performances. Zeidler Hall, is used mainly for the viewing of films, holds around 240 audience members. The smallest performance space is Tucker Hall, which is a small amphitheater with seating for 150 viewers. Adjacent to the Maclab Theatre and the Tucker Amphitheatre is the Lee Pavilion, an interior green space complete with a waterfall that is located right in the center of Edmonton. Located on the corner of an important intersection in downtown Edmonton, the façade of the new Citadel theatre is mainly composed of red brick and glazing. The glazing along the façade allows for the public that is passing by to see the activities unfolding within the building. The Citadel Theatre encloses and unifies multiple different types of performance spaces all within one single building. The building was originally built for 6.5 million dollars but is currently valued at around 40 million dollars. When the architect, Barton Meyers, spoke of the building he talked about it being a "warm and theatrical place" which is the perfect solution for a theatre in the heart of a Canadian city.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
The Shoctor Theatre is one of the five performance spaces within the Citadel Theatre. It is designed as a proscenium style theatre ­ the stage is contained within an opening, most commonly known as a proscenium arch. The Shoctor Theatre is rectilinear in shape with a rounded seating arrangement radiating from the stage. It contains a stepped floor that minimizes the distance between each person and the sound source. This also provides good sight lines to each audience member which in turn results in good direct sound. This theatre does not contain a balcony and as a result there is less opportunity for acoustical defects. The ceiling above the stage is angled toward the audience to provide a more useful reflection minimizing the possibility of an echo. A series of ceiling reflectors allow for more useful reflections that create a better quality sound even for the distant seats in the back of the house. These segmented reflectors are flat, have an angled orientation and are made of a hard wood material allowing for adequate loudness. Due to the inclined ceiling panels, reflected sound will not be focused directly downward, maintaining the clarity of a performer's speech. In addition, the sound will not reach an audience member from behind, assuring that one's sound localization is not muddled from an overhead location. The materiality of the seats are of a red velvet fabric that works as an absorbing material for sound. All of the raised floors, aside from the stage, are covered in this material to absorb sound as well. Wood is used for the wall and ceiling treatments within the auditorium. This material is highly reflective which serves to scatter sound. The convex forms of the side walls causes a dispersive effect, diffusing reflections of sound creating shorter reverberation times. The optimal reverberation time for this type of theatre would be approximately 1.3 seconds. The ceiling reflectors and the back wall ­ all made of a wooden material ­ direct sound downward where it is then absorbed by the carpeted floor or cushioned seating. These elements of the theatre are working to control echoes, creating a more comfortable listening environment for the audience. Speakers are provided above the stage and along the side walls of the theatre. Near the centre line parallel to the stage are delay speakers, providing sound 2530 milliseconds after the original sound from the stage is projected. Essentially, these devices amplify the first wavefront from the sound source. Lower frequencies that are easily absorbed by many things such as the seating and audience members are now more likely to be heard from a distance. This creates a more uniform distribution of sound, regardless of one's proximity to the stage. All in all, the Shoctor Theatre performs well acoustically for varying types of audio performances. Its interior finishes and design aspects all work toward improving the sound quality of the performances for the audience members.

THEATRE HISTORY
was well executed, it is the concert hall that is the true focus of the project. The hall draws design influence from Vienna's Musikvereinssaal and Zurich's Tonhalle. With these precedents in mind the centre for music was designed to be a modern adaptation to the classic shoebox design that many of the 19th and 20th century concert halls exhibited. With a relatively large concert hall of over 1900 seats, significant complexity is brought into the design of the space since reverberation is likely to occur. Additionally, the space is meant to be flexible for different types of performances. This meant that acoustically, the music hall must be balanced so amplified and unamplified performances of differing After a two-year hiatus and a restructure of the foundation that was financing the project, the design scales would have a consistent acoustical quality. started again under a design-build configuration. With recognition that the Edmonton was in need Although the building experienced significant delay for a centre for music, there was significant and extra cost, the results of the tremendous efforts contributions from the Federal and Provincial truly speak for themselves.

Additionally Francis Winspear Music is an iconic part of Edmonton's cultural donated $6 million, which was the largest individual environment, and will continue to amaze its audience both visually and acoustically for quite some time. donation to a Canadian Arts Centre at the time. The Francis Winspear Centre for Music opened in September of 1997 after 15 years of planning and construction. The choice of site took six years alone. The decided upon location was once an old police station and now creates a public square in combination with Edmonton City Hall, Edmonton Art Gallery, Citadel Theatre and Milner Library. To show support for the endeavour, the City of Edmonton generously offered a 90 year lease on the property for the mere price of $1.00. However, even after extensive feasibility studies and finance planning, the project came in well over budget in 1992. Since the project finished construction, it has become central to the cities arts and cultural scene. The centre was designed in a way that respond to the particular urban context of the site. The site features irregular angles and shapes, which is ultimately reflected in the organization of the building. For example, the theatre could only be located in certain positions on the site, and therefore it was a significant driver of the building form. Formal moves implemented by the design team aimed to bring the large scale of the building back down to the pedestrian level. For example, the foyer that faces the public square is compressed in relation to the large lobby and concert hall behind. The concert hall is clearly expressed in the facades of the building as a towering mass of the extruded theatre plan. Although the building's response the to urban scale

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
With the concert hall being the focus of the facility, the acoustics of the space where of the utmost importance for the audience as well as the performers. Artec consultants believe that the first step to impeccable acoustics is silence. Therefore, great lengths were taken to eliminate exterior noise to the performance space. This was done by creating a structurally isolated performance volume that acts separately from the rest of the building. Additionally, the mechanical system needed to be reconsidered to ensure silence. Typically there is a high demand on a building during a winter in this climate to keep the space warm. To ensure that high velocity airflow did not interrupt the performance, large ducts (3m x 2.5m) had to be manufactured and installed. Finally, a series of acoustical joints and massive room boundaries result in a hall that is completely free of external noise. Once the exterior noise influences were removed, the acoustics were planned inside the shoebox to maximize the acoustics for a range of performances. By controlling the reverberation of the sound classical symphonies and orchestration are able to performance with optimal acoustics in the same space as folk, jazz country and voice performances. This was achieved by a mechanized adjustable system that incorporated a sound reflecting canopy, reflector panels and velour curtains. These devices adjust in height and surface area. For example, the double-layered sound adsorptive banners adjust to make sound for a smaller scale, amplified performance enhanced compared to an unamplified large performance such as a symphony. Sound diffusion at high frequencies was another area that needed to be carefully considered. The designers and consultants mitigated the negative effects of this while simultaneously creating an interesting aesthetic on the walls by adding a relief pattern to the walls. As the concrete walls at the side of the audience chamber were being poured, a decorative patterning was cast into them. This allows the sound to reverberate and diffuse along the increased surface area of the walls. The hall is also capped off with feature. This large void cut out of ceiling allows for sound to resonate without interfering with the users a `top hat' the dropped and disperse experience.

The combination of these factors makes the Winspear Centre a truly magnificent space for a wide variety of musical performances, while still maintaining a stunning aesthetic appearance.

THEATRE HISTORY
The Esplanade Arts and Heritage Centre is located in downtown Medicine Hat, located on the southeastern corner of Alberta, two and a half hours from Calgary. The city holds a panoramic landscape of cliffs, coulees and prairie along the South Saskatchewan River Valley. The project, which opened in October 2005, was built as part of Alberta's Centennial Legacy Projects and transformed the small city of 50,000 by shifting the focus of the downtown blocks and towards the South Saskatchewan River. The early planning of the town used a typical colonial grid, seen in the larger scale prairie farmland, disregarded many of the natural features of the landscape. The Esplanade Arts and Heritage Centre engages the important natural landscape including the South Saskatchewan River, the Saamis teepee, the shoreline escarpment and the larger scale prairie farmland surrounding the city. This project melds the contemporary Canadian architecture located on the traditional Blackfoot territory. The overall project was conceived as a series of large rooms with a centre emphasizes on an importance of public space and natural light. The major programmatic components of the building include a 700-seat performing arts theatre, a 2,300-square-meter museum, an art gallery with archival facilities and a 150 seat studio theatre. The building is clad in aluminum and glass curtain wall and custom made slate grey, smooth-textured facade brick donated by I-XL Industries Ltd. as part of the Centennial, and to reference Medicine Hat's second industry.

From the open main foyer with a large spiral stair leads to the 700-seat theatre located on the north-east corner of the building. The theatre also has a custom designed orchestra pit which can seat approximately 30 musicians, with finishes to match the box walls and balcony fascia and can be stored in the fly-tower when not in use. The room uses a combination of wood and exposed concrete in a fragmented matrix of panels of varying sizes which answer to both the acoustics and aesthetics of the space. The theatre is designed to function for both music and theatrical The project was designed out of a need for the Medicine Hat performances for both professionals and local talent in the Museum, Art Gallery and Archives which had outgrown their community. The connection to the community encouraged capacity, causing the City looked to look at new expansion. people to engage more in the arts and performance fields, The community prides itself on its local arts, heritage and which increased the interaction between the residents of culture and wanted to expand to create a multi-purpose Medicine Hat. As a strong cultural centre, the building links cultural centre to bring together many different disciplines together both spectators and artists from all generations, from local and regional artists and performers. This lead to which has increased the appeal of the city in Alberta. the addition of a performing arts theatre, which did not yet exist in the community despite the School of Performing The techniques and the knowledge gained from the Arts and many local musicians and artists in the area. acoustical analysis and the cultural success of the project have made this an esteemed theatre. The project has This addition along with an expanded museum, gallery and successfully brought the community together archives were able to combine the disciplines of visual art, and has become an influential precedent for the next performance and culture heritage for the community to generations of performance halls around Canada, such as gather and celebrate. Through the mixture of programs, the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts both educational and recreational, the building is able to (FSCPA). accommodate activities throughout at all times of the day and become a central hub for the community.

The scale model, of course, includes natural wave affects and, at least in this instance, provides a more accurate prediction. This is rather interesting because in this project, the scale model was something of a second thought. It was originally used for relative comparisons of different ceiling designs. Not a lot of effort was put into the absolute calibration of the model. Much more effort was focussed on the computer model. Nonetheless, in the end, the scale model proved more accurate.

Attention was given to the high quality of sound received from each seat in the theatre. In order to maintain this quality, the sound from the stage needed to distribute into the room homogeneously. The wood panels achieved this by being positioned at various depths and angles to reflect the sound to the seating around the same times without losing its quality. In addition, while the wood panels reflect the intended sound, the carpet and acoustical curtains are used to absorb the unwanted noise. During the design phase, the architects wanted to have a low transparent ceiling to create a warm atmosphere

THEATRE HISTORY
Chan Shun Concert Hall is housed by Chan Centre for the Performing Arts and its construction has had initial donations from Tom and Caleb Chan to make the proposal possible. At the time, this was the largest private donation to a cultural institution in the Canadian history. In addition to the initial donation, the Chan brothers provided further funding in order to establish an endowment fund, which envisioned to support arts and performance organizations at the local, national and international level, through the interest revenue that it produced. Thus the Chan Centre for the Performing Arts consists of both theatre concert halls and educational facilities to provide the students of University and local community with a space to enjoy and study performance arts.

The Chan Shun Concert Hall, funded by the Chan brothers, took approximately 2 years of construction to complete. This was done as a collaborative project in conjunction between Bing Thom Architects for the overall building design and ARTEC Consultants for the concert hall and acoustic specifications. The lead architect for the project The story behind the massive support was that the Chan was the firm's owner Bing Thom, with the ARTEC's team led brothers were heavily influenced by their father, Chan by the acoustician, Russell Johnson. Together the two Shun's generous and charitable attitudes towards business. companies worked in partnership in order to create After they immigrated to Vancouver, Canada, they wanted optimum acoustic conditions for the Chan Shun Concert to repay their new country and decided to assist Hall from inside out. While designing, numerous creative constructing educational arts facilities nearby. Therefore the ideas and applications were thought out in order to meet Chan brothers proposed their plan the design challenges that concern both architectural and to David Strangway, the president of University of British acoustical factors. For example, a 22.7-ton chandelier-like Columbia (UBC) at the time, and initiated the construction of acoustical canopy was designed to accommodate different performance arts centre shortly after. musical styles by having its height adjusted to optimally reflect sound. The Centre is located on the campus of the University, prominently sited within the natural landscape of the In spite of a number of challenges the project encountered campus to take advantage of the evergreens and with during the design process, the resulting building has rhododendrons that surround the building. Along with the been named as one of the world's best concert halls in Chan Shun Concert Hall, the building also houses the terms of its acoustical conditions. According to the flexible-seating Telus Studio Theatre, the 160-seat Royal musicians and artists who have performed in the hall, the Bank Cinema, and the Great Performers Lounge for the use space is like an instrument of its own; how sensitively the of both the University and the community of greater room reacts to different musical conditions.

The idea of two drums connecting to each other was developed during the early stage in schematic design phase of the project in order to symbolize the Centre as a musical instrument of its own. In addition, the Centre also contains spaces to host classes, rehearsals and performances for the University's departments of music, film and theatre.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
The Chan Shun Concert Hall has a capacity of approximately 1200 with additional 200 choral loft seats above the stage to be used when necessary, with a high quality sound reinforcement system which provide controls over levels, crossovers, delay and equalization of every loudspeaker in the cluster as well as trim height for the entire cluster. The EAW central cluster offers smooth cluster coverage to every seat in the house, except the last seat on the each end of the first row where it drops by 1dB. In terms of design, simple architectural finishes further extend the musical motif with the use of cables and frets which grace the upper walls, complemented by white maple soffits and balcony fronts. Furthermore, the shape of the hall takes its inspiration from the cello. The cello-like shape of the hall comes from the acoustically successful horseshoe shape with blond maple curved walls, which allows for an even distribution of sound throughout the performance space, no matter where the audience are sitting in the hall. Ultimately, the hall acts as a "reverberation chamber," where the subtlest change in musical colour or volume can be heard. Additionally, the concrete walls are oriented in a reverse fan to reflect the sound without echo. The construction was done with over 6,500 cubic metres of concrete which can be seen throughout the building. The concrete walls have been jack hammered to create a stippled surface which help to break down sound and prevent reverberation; it also promotes a warm and intimate sound. Also, all of the wood seen in the concert hall has been sealed to the concrete in order to prevent any sympathetic vibrations. In order to avoid the possible focalization problems due to the massive concave surfaces, large radius convex curve was implemented behind each section of the balconies, along with exposed aggregate concrete walls which provide good mid and high frequency diffusion. As a result, the reverberation decay is diffused smoothly throughout the hall. Furthermore, behind the stage at the rear wall are acoustically transparent woven maple wood panels with a solid door behind each panel that can be opened or closed to tailor the reflected energy from the rear of the stage. Another response to provide additional absorption when necessary was the curtains which are constructed of two layers of very heavy fabric with 6 inches of air space between, the entire banners hanging out about 4 inches from the wall. As a result, the reverberation time of the room can be varied from 4.5 seconds with the curtains out to 2.75 seconds with all the curtains in at the frequency of about 250 Hz. Motorized acoustical banners can be extended to reduce the reverberation for amplified events, and other musical offerings where a "dry" acoustic is preferred. The exceptional acoustical environment of the hall is created by a 22.7-tonne acoustic canopy made of steel and cork with a chandelier like mechanism above the platform, allowing the music director and musicians to tailor their acoustical environment for each event. The suspended canopy reflects sound back to the performers and to the audience, which is adjustable in height to accommodate a variety of groups and musical styles: lower settings are typically used for soloists and smaller ensembles while higher settings are preferred for orchestras and amplified productions. The canopy itself is 15.2 m by 12.2 m, and can be adjusted from 2.8 m to 17.8 m to adjust the arrival time of overhead reflections, with the typical performance heights ranging between 12 m to 14.5 m. Furthermore, the adjustable shutters located behind the upstage wicker wall allow for alterations to the intensity of the sound as heard by the performers. Closing the shutters generates an immediate reflection back to the performers, which is the standard configuration. Opening the shutters causes the backstage area to become a resonating chamber with the first reflection being substantially delayed, diffused, and diminished. The hall's flexibility and adaptability ensure optimal acoustical environment even when the venue does not always have a full house, which act as a great sound absorber. Such adjustability make it possible for the University to use the hall for teaching and rehearsing which require relatively acoustically dry environment. Its highlyregarded acoustics, however, also make it a chosen venue for the University's recordings, local and regional groups, touring chamber music groups and recitalists. The layout also makes it conducive to semi-staged concert opera productions by the University's music department. With its flexibility and adaptability as key features in the design of the concert hall, the hall stands as a prime precedent of relationship between acoustics and architecture.

THEATRE HISTORY
The Orpheum was originally commissioned by a Germanborn Vancouver entrepreneur named Joseph Langer, who owned several smaller suburban theatres around the Vancouver area. However, these theatres were sold to finance the construction of the Orpheum. As one of seventeen other similar theatres built throughout Canada and leased to the Chicago-based Orpheum Circuit, the Orpheum Theatre was the largest and most grandiose theatres in Canada for several years since its grand opening on November 7, 1927. Built in the conservative Spanish Renaissance style, the visionary behind the design was Scottish-born Seattle-based architect Benjamin Marcus Priteca. However, Priteca also borrowed from an assortment of other styles in addition to Spanish Renaissance: the ornate lobby ceiling is based on a design from India; the organ screens are Moorish North African; and the auditorium's ceiling, dome, and chandeliers are Baroque. Although the theatre operated for four years as a vaudeville house, a combination of factors such as changing public tastes, the collapse of the Orpheum Circuit, and the difficult economic climate of the Great Depression led to the Orpheum's takeover by the Famous Players Cinema Chain in the 1930s. The theatre continued to remain a large player in Vancouver's cultural landscape largely due to the efforts of its legendary theatre manager, Ivan Ackery Performing simultaneous roles as both administrator and promoter, Ackery was especially known for his attention-grabbing promotional stunts to (successfully) draw crowds and fill theatre seats. The Orpheum also continued to occasionally host live shows and concerts, remaining one of two halls used by the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra between 1930 1959. The theatre was also imbued with the glamour of celebrity - the stars who passed through the Orpheum's stage from the 1930s to 1970s include notables such as Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, Arthur Rubinstein, and Marian Anderson. Unfortunately, by the 1970s, the Orpheum had fallen into disrepair and was being considered for redevelopment as a multiplex theatre. However, the Vancouver community rallied to save the historic theatre from demolition. In 1973, a campaign was launched by the Community Arts Council of Vancouver and the city's mayor, Art Phillips, to acquire the Orpheum as a permanent home for the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. With federal, provincial, and private support, the City of Vancouver purchased the theatre for $3.9 million in 1974. After an additional $3.2 million was raised for restoration and renovation costs, work began on the project in 1975 under the supervision of local architects Thomas, Berwick, Pratt, and Partners. Some of the changes that occurred during the renovation include the extension of the stage over the orchestra pit, the installation of a permanent orchestra shell, and the stage loft was removed in favor of additional rehersal areas, dressing rooms, a lounge, and a library. After the acoustic tiles covering the vaulted oval ceiling were removed, a stunning mural of Orpheus by the theatre's original decorator, Tony Heinsbergen, was also added. Finally, on April 2, 1977, the Orpheum reopened its doors with an inaugural concert to celebrate its new life as a civic concert hall. Since the original 1977 restoration, the Orpheum has undergone four additional renovations. In 1983, a new entrance and foyer was created at 601 Smithe Street, something the original builders had also planned. In 1995, the theatre received an acoustic upgrade, and the theatre was restored and refurbished with new seating, interior signage, and light and sound locks in preparation for the Cultural Olympiad prior to the 2010 Winter Olympic Games. The most recent renovation of the theatre was completed in 2011, with the addition of a 14 000 sq. ft. rehearsal room and 24 000 sq. ft. of space for the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra School of Music. The $23 million cultural investment project also included the further extension of the theatre's stage.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
OVERALL ACOUSTICS Originally designed as a vaudeville theatre, the Orpheum currently serves as the home of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. In the 1970s renovations, a rear stage enclosure with added sound absorbing material in specific locations were added during the conversion to a concert hall. When compared to other North American concert halls, the 2780 capacity theater has a reverberance that is slightly below average and a clarity about average. The strength of sound is slightly lower due to the size of the room and the extensive balcony overhang. UNDER-BALCONY ACOUSTICS (See Fig. 7) One of the main issues facing the theater were the poor acoustics of the under-balcony. On the orchestra level, over 50% of the seats are covered by the balcony which prevents them from experiencing the volume of the room and have a noticeably different reverberation when compared to the balcony seats above or the unblocked portion of the orchestra level. As many speakers are located on the ceiling, this space suffers. They lack direct sound projection and only receive reflected sound being under the balcony and out of direct sight line of these speakers. In addition, with the large number of seats in the under-balcony, the sound pressure level varies greatly depending on the depth into the space. In 1970, in an attempt to address this problem, microphones were placed above and in front of the stage to carry the sound to speakers projecting to under the balcony to amplify the sound from the stage. However, this enhancement system was unsuccessful as there was not enough gain to provide strong feedback. The enhancement system was eventually remedied by moving the microphones closer towards the balcony. STAGE ECHO (See Fig. 6) A common problem with concert halls is the echo created within the stage house (the space including the stage, wings and gallery). The sound from the stage monitor system, the audio system on stage pointed towards the performers to help them hear themselves, is not absorbed by the stage and is reflected by the orchestra shell and the rear wall of the stage into the balcony. The reflected path of "cue ball" echo creates late reflection in the balcony space. IMAGE SHIFT The most serious acoustic issue facing the Orpheum was the image shift heard on the balcony level - an acoustical phenomenon that occurs when the sound appears to

be coming from a location other than its true source. This made it very difficult for conductors to achieve a reliable balance between the sections of the orchestra as singers or soloists appear to sound as if they are perched somewhere above the ceiling. It was suspected that the effect was caused by concave components at the interface of the wall and the ceiling, which focused the reflected sound and increased its amplitude. Although computer modeling software developed by Aercoustics confirmed that reflections coming from these parts of the ceiling were directed to seating areas where image shift occurred, existing computer algorithms could not accurately predict the acoustical focusing that was at the root of the problem. Additionally, the direct sound coming from the stage was reduced by wave effects created at the surface of the seats. Since the reflected sound from the ceiling was not subject to these effects, it arrived at the listener significantly louder than the direct sound. To resolve these problems, the team at Aercoustics built a 1:50 scaled physical model of the theatre itself. As the behavior of sound scales up or down perfectly, the wave effects, focusing, and the chaotic nature of reverberant sound that affected the Orpheum were also all present in the model. Additionally, Aercoustics commissioned researchers at the National Research Council to also work on the problem. The researchers' findings determined that the reflection coming from the ceiling must be 0 to -2 decibels with respect to the direct sound - no louder than the sound coming from the stage. The first attempt at fixing the problem involved hanging convex reflectors underneath the offending areas of the model ceiling. However, although the first convex reflector proposed by the architect did reduce the focused reflection, it was still 7 dB higher than the direct sound. After further testing, it was determined that an arc radius of 15 feet was required to reduce the reflection to the required 0 dB. These reflectors were fabricated from 1" plaster and were installed during the summer of 1995.

PYATT HALL
CITY: ADDRESS: ACOUSTICS CONSULTANT: ARCHITECT: OWNER: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: Vancouver, British Columbia 843 Seymour St. Aercoustics Engineering Bingham + Hill Architects Vancouver Symphony Orchestra $25,000,000 for the entire hall. 2011

THEATRE HISTORY
Vancouver's Pyatt Hall is a part of a 42 storey building which houses the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra (VSO) School of Music. Located at 843 Seymour Avenue in Vancouver, British Columbia, The building, designed by Bingham Hill Architects with help from acoustician John O'keefe, is located next to the Orpheum Theatre, where VSO musicians perform. The building was first envisioned in 2003 and opened in 2011, with an inaugural performance by Daniel Bolshoy, a classical guitarist, and teacher at the VSO School of Music, in the state of the art Pyatt Hall. Classical musicians in the VSO generally need extra income, which they receive from teaching music, however most of them have to teach from their homes, meaning they have to travel back and forth between home and work. In 2003 VSO music director Bramwell Tovey saw a need for a music school near Orpheum hall, where VSO musicians perform, to help cut this travel time. He envisioned the VSO School of Music, where students off all backgrounds would be able to come and learn from VSO musicians. While looking for a site he didn't have to look far, because the Capital 6 Movie theatre was just moving out of their auditorium next to the Orpheum Theatre. The site was bought by developer Rob Macdonald for $7.6 million, and plans begun for the VSO School of Music. The $25 million cost of construction was offset by the developer by adding 25 residential storeys, providing 372 condos, to the now 42 storey building. An additional 250,000 sq. ft. of bonus density was provided to the team, to provide for additional civic space, which includes the VSO School of Music, the 120 seat Pyatt Hall, and an additional 220 seat theatre and rehearsal space. The 42 storey tower is split with residential units at the top, and civic spaces at the bottom. The "gem of the building" (Mackie, 2011) is however Pyatt Hall, a 120 seat acoustically and vibrationally isolated theatre used by the students of the school, and also rented out for events. Entering on the second floor, the user is brought into a 1,500 sq. ft., 3 storey tall space clad in stone and maple. The theatre can be configured in multiple ways, allowing for both banquet and performance settings. The stage, with sprung flooring, can be configured in different ways, and gala-lift flooring allows for the flooring to be adapted from flat to raked seating very easily. The hall "combines a classical spirit with the benefits of 21st Century technology" (VSO School of Music, n.d.), with acoustic panels that can be adjusted for the many different configurations of the space.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
Pyatt Hall is a small venue within the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra School of Music. John O'Keefe, an acoustician from Aercoustics Engineering, collaborated with Bingham Hill Architects to create this intimate space. Hosting 120 non-fixed seats, this theatre is able to transform from a flat event space into raked seated theatre through it's gala-lift flooring system. The irregular shape of the theatre forms non-parallel surfaces, decreasing the effects of flutter echo in both plan and section. The stage has a lifted ceiling as seen in Figure 4, where the stage enclosure reflection that occurs on a non-parallel surface. In plan, as seen in Figure 1, the hall is distorted geometry, providing useful side-wall reflections. The shape of the hall is just the beginning. The entire space is considered to be a `box-in-a-box,' where the hall is enclosed by an air pocket within the building. The theatre rests on an engineered jack-up floating floor slab and is separated from the venue by a 2" air gap (Refer to Figure 3). This gap is vital in acoustically and vibrationally separating the hall from the rest of the building- keeping all music within the space in, and all music outside of the space, out. Once inside Pyatt Hall, the atmosphere created by the materials and details will capture you right away. "It looks natural -- you have rock, you have wood, you just want sound" (Mackie, 2011)... And in this case, Pyatt Hall definitely brings you sound. Maple wood acoustic slats on surfaces with heavily applied acoustical paint are placed vertically throughout the room. They are angled and spaced specifically to diffuse sound, as well as have motors to provide acoustic excellence for multiple room configurations. For example, sound waves would travel on different paths when having performances with thrust seating verses proscenium seating arrangements. The light wood panels are then placed next to stone veneer facades. This wall cladding contains basalt, a volcanic stone that has high thermal and acoustical insulation properties. This stone is high in porosity and can act as porous absorber, helping defuse and reflect sound waves within the venue. The irregular form of the stone contributes to micro-diffusion in which sound waves bounce off the rock's surface in a variety of directions. Similar to the non-parallel form of the theatre, having nonuniform surfaces decreases the amount of flutter echo.

QUEEN ELIZABETH THEATRE
CITY: ADDRESS: ACOUSTICS CONSULTANT: ARCHITECT: OWNER: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: RESTORATION DATE: Vancouver, British Columbia 650 Hamilton Street Aercoustics Engineering Ltd. ARCOP Architects Vancouver Civic Theatres $9,000,000 July, 1959 2006-2009

THEATRE HISTORY
The Queen Elizabeth Theatre was designed during a competition held by the Vancouver Civic Theatres board which was looking to supply Vancouver with a major performance space for concerts, operas, and the like. The competition was won by a group of five young architects in 1956 who conceived a great multi-purpose performance space which later became one of the largest Canadian theatres constructed in this post-war era. These architects later formed the world renowned ARCOP Architects firm which employed the body of the designers and architects responsible for the buildings 1998 renovation. The design included alongside the traditional seating arrangement a set of seating which traveled up the northeast and south west walls that frame the stage. The later dubbed "ski slope" was uncommon in north American theatres which were drifting away from the more traditional and European horseshoe shaped performance spaces to a more linear style. The impact which the Queen Elizabeth Theatre caused in Vancouver at the time was both profound as it gave the entertainment scene a much needed boost in publicity. In addition to the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra who were the original patrons, the theatre became a home to the Vancouver Opera Association, the Vancouver International Festival, the Vancouver Symphony Society, World Adventure Tours, and Famous Artists Limited. The building's proximity to Seattle also greatly increased the number of American performers in Canada as promoters were able to extend their western tours of Broadway shows north of the boarder and into the Queen Elizabeth. The original theatre space was able to hold a large number of people but was designed without the knowledge of the importance of spatial sound. Because of this, studies were conducted in order to identify the cause of the theatres flat reverberance as well as improving the air conditioning and construction a new shell for the symphony space. Major renovations began in and around 1986 in preparation for Vancouver's hosting of Expo 86. the main lobby was renovated with all new materials which updated the look of the space to be reflective, textured, and bold in comparison to the original clean and modest design. In addition to the textural changes, a new control room was added to the lobby space along with banners which were used to cover the structural columns underneath the mezzanine. A small set of renovations occurred in 1991 where public amenity spaces were expanded and improved. In 1997-1998, there became a greater appreciation for spatial sound and the way heights and widths of performance spaces impacted decay times. For this reason, the "ski slope" seating was replaced with side wall balconies which decreased the width of the space and increased the early decay time to reverberance time ratio. The next set of renovations and analyses occurred in 2006 when the theatre was reassessed and 3D models were created in order to monitor the performance of the space. A four phase plan was conceived for the building beginning with splitting the theatre into two separate hall s which were acoustically isolated from one another . In the following 3 years, the venue unveiled a completely changed auditorium, lobby space, art gallery, and theatre seating as well as improved acoustic paneling to create a space which is deserving of its international acclaim.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
Considered a very strong influence to theatre design in North America, the Queen Elizabeth Theatre is home to a variety of different performances. Due to such a diversity of performance, as well as a notably large concert hall (exceeding 32 meters), the acoustic properties of the space were to be given substantial consideration. In order to control the sound reverberation inside the concert hall, certain elements of acoustical design were implemented in the halls renovation. Firstly, lateral reflectors were to be hung in the truss spacing of the room. Secondly, terraced seating condition was designed to reflect the orientation of such reflectors. Although the original design for the concert hall in 1998 had a ceiling cover the truss system, the revitalization of the space has caused the entire ceiling to be removed. Exposing the truss system resulted in a 4.5 m increase in room height, and allowed for 7 pairs of lateral reflectors to be placed in between the truss system. The iterative process of determining the articulation of these acoustic reflectors began by orienting four large panels at the back of the theatre to distribute sound to the balconies. Eventually an elliptical pattern of reflectors was designed to hang between each truss, and oriented to reflect sound to the opposite side of the room. Although these lateral reflectors provided the concert hall with a more balanced sound quality, there was concern that they would interfere with the alternate performances that the venue would provide. While the Vancouver Opera would benefit from the distribution of sound caused by the reflectors, there was question that the reflectors would interfere with sound clarity from the loudspeakers in the concert hall. There was potential to design the reflectors as being operable, but after further research it was determined that the lateral reflectors could remain fixed. While It can be observed that the design of the concert hall was heavily focussed around requisites determined by the Vancouver Opera, the theatre still lacked the ability to enhance other performances in the venue.

The typical solution for dampening the sound was the implementation of acoustic absorption banners. Vancouver Civic Theatres took issue with using such banners, as they had proved frustrating to clean and were known to only absorb high frequency sound. Keeping the clients needs in mind, the architect proposed a Sound and Light Lock (SLL) corridor on either side of the concert hall. A set of doors would be placed along the walls of the opposing SLL with the ability to modify the sound quality of the room, depending on the performance. These doors would remain open to expose the absorption material located in the corridor in order to decrease reverberation in the room. The corridor was designed to be lined with 100mm thick glass fibre over gypsum panelling that would dampen any sound entering the space. It can be observed that the acoustic quality of the auditorium has been manipulated over time through rigorous sound analysis of the interior space. Through incremental renovations, the concert hall has adapted to enhance the sound of multiple performances in the same venue.

THEATRE HISTORY
The story of the York Theatre is the story of changing purpose and changing identities. As it stands now, it is a modern facility with LEED Gold certification that serves as a multipurpose performance and event space with a 365 seat capacity. Designed by John Mcarter in 1913 as the Alcazar theatre, it stood out as the only theatre on the East side of Vancouver with a fly tower and proscenium stage and is one of three remaining historic theatres in Vancouver. The theatre has had a long history of different owners and major renovations. The first major renovation to the Alcazar theatre came in 1940 which replaced the theatres classical styling with an upgraded art deco facade which was contemporary for its time. The name was also changed to the name used today, the York Theatre. From the 1940s on the York Theatre was seen a multi-purpose performance event space that was used for a variety of events from live theatre, and concerts, where it saw famous performers such as Sonic Youth and Nirvana. In 1978 the York Theatre was sold because of the ensuing upkeep of the aging theatre. It was converted into The Raja Theatre, which was devoted to hosting Bollywood films. In 1981 the owners attempted to demolish the theatre but great community resistance was formed, and the "Save the York Theatre Society" was established. When the Raja Theatre went out of business the building quickly became vulnerable to redevelopment and by 2008 it was slated for demolition to make room for row housing. Due to community support and the efforts by the "save the York Theatre society", enough interest was garnered to make the revitalization feasible. The renovations by Henriquez Partners Architects, Henrequez Partner Architects introduced a 2-storey glass lobby to reveal the mosaic finishes of interior. Most of the original theatre has remained with upgrades conducted to qualify the theatre for a LEED gold standard. The facade of the building has been redone in homage to its Art Deco past. It is now managed by The Cultch as a rental venue for a multitude of performances and special events.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
Built during the 1900s, the York Theatre has seen many changes over its 100 year life. From Bollywood films to Nirvana performances the theatre has provided the surrounding community with a wide variety of activities requiring different types of acoustic treatment. The theatre, once an undesirable performance space is now an architectural gem that satisfies the acoustic requirements of those performing while maintaining a LEED Gold standard. A major spatial feature that plays a large role in the York Theatre's acoustics is it's size. The York Theatre sits at around 3000 m3 meaning that the space has little need for acoustic reflectors. Acoustic paneling is utilized in order to diffuse sound from the HVAC above. Since the space is so small, the lack of useful ceiling reflections has a very minuscule effect on the listener. First order and second order reflections follow closely after one another due to the proximity of the audience in relation to the sounds source. An assumed optimal reverberation time for the York Theatre would be 1.1 seconds as the building is classified as both a cinema and a small theatre. DWD theatre design+consulting played a major role in the selection of materials and the theatre layout. The walls surrounding three sides are drywall and the paneling on the mezzanine face is curved treated plywood while the far back of the theatre is cinder block covered with tile. This also acts as a fire barrier. The stage is done in a maisonette finish. Acoustic consultants, David Brown Acoustics focused on how these materials interacted with sound and how the shape of the room would affect the travel paths. In the buildings plan a reverse fan structure is installed to prevent echoing of sound through the space. An acoustically weak portion of the York theatre is the seating under the rooms mezzanine. Like many theatres the mezzanine prevents clear travel of sound to the occupants below leaving only the direct sound path to reach the viewers. However the mezzanine is small in comparison to other theatres so the negative effect is minimal.

The theatre building also features a velvet curtain. When sound hits this curtain incident sound is absorbed and the reflection is weakened. The drapery that is installed along the walls including the back stage can be pulled back, exposing the drywall which in return creates different reverberation times. The curtains location is based on different sound requirements for the variety of activities that happen within the theatre.

This "modernist based" design firm approaches each project, the Evergreen Cultural Centre included, with an analytical framework, starting with a deep rooted understanding of programmatic elements. It is from that foundation that they progress creatively in their articulation of form and aesthetic expression, maintain their reputation for environmental design and technical expertise. This project was commissioned by the City of Coquitlam and received funding by both the Federal and Provincial sectors. As a not for profit organization, it is enabled to operate due to further government funding, corporate sponsors and revenue generated by box office sales. Ever since opening, it has been the goal of the Evergreen Cultural Centre to promote the arts to all ages and offer a wide variety of entertainment and engaging activity through music, comedy, theatrical production and artistic installations. Within the walls of the cultural centre is housed a 1500 square foot art gallery open to the public, along with an additional 5000 square feet of program, including a grand lobby with a magnificent view onto Lafarge lake, a 275 seat studio theatre, rehearsal halls, teaching studios and retail space. The 80 000 people who came to this vibrant cultural centre in 2014 alone, are a testament to the success of centre, its programs and its architectural design. Future engagement with the surrounding context will include the addition of a large 750 seat main-stage theatre as well as the connection to the Lafarge Lake Douglas station which is still under construction.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
The most important characteristic of the Large Studio Theatre in the Evergreen Cultural Centre is that it is primarily a blackbox theatre The main central seats are a retractable set allowing for the space to transform and adapt to different uses such as for performances or for banquets. In this sense, it can be understood that this theatre, is not a theatre at all, but a multi-use assembly space with its main concerns not on acoustical properties but on adaptability of the space. Nevertheless, the theatre does have some properties to improve its acoustical performance. The dimensions of the Studio Theatre are approximately 20m long and 15m wide. Referring to the image of the theatre, the central retractable seating assembly measures 14 seats per row with around 15 rows along with two levels of mezzanine on both sides each with approximately 12 seats. This adds up to around the 257 seats which Evergreen Cultural Centre advertises their venue. Furthermore, deducing from the photo, the floor the floor heights are approximately 3m, meaning with 3 levels of seating, and a level for the catwalk, the total height of the space is 12m. With these numbers, the approximate volume of the space is 3600m2. The most notable aspect of the theatre is that the walls and floors are all simply finished in concrete. This immediately brings up the problem of high levels of reflectance, increasing reverberation time, and therefore causing clashes between new and lingering sound waves. To prevent this, the theatre actually has pull out curtains in certain areas of the theatre, especially behind the seats along the mezzanine levels to absorb the sound before they can reflect and possibility cause flutter echo in the tight floor to ceiling mezzanine space. Another acoustical feature are the wood panels that finish the railings along the mezzanine levels. The wood panels are noticeably angled downward, presumably to reflect sound back towards the center and therefore increasing loudness and in turn the warmth of the space. Lastly, the open ceiling of the theatre space and the cat walk create numerous surfaces to diffuse the sound as they travel upwards, preventing any major echoes and long reverberation times in the space. Although each of these features are fairly basic solutions without highly sophisticated acoustical devices, they each serve their purpose to fulfill some sort of criteria on Barenek's list of acoustic standards. Together, these simple acoustic devices may not achieve the acoustic performance needed of a full fixed seat concert hall, but is adequate for the purpose of a blackbox theatre.

THEATRE HISTORY
The Royal Theatre is considered one of the oldest and most significant landmarks in its heritage site of Broughton, Victoria. It was constructed in 1913 as a live musical and vaudeville performance theatre between 1913-1930 by the Victoria Opera House Company. Upon researching similar building typologies for the execution of the theatre design, the architects, Rochefort and Sankey, were impressed with the successful design of the Orpheum Theatre in Seattle and designed the ground floor and balcony of The Royal Theatre in a similar way. In 1930, the building was acquired by Famous Players and became a successful movie theatre. The Royal was then purchased by the Capital Regional District in 1973 and renovated. Upgrades included a new electrical and acoustical system, new seating and loading area, to accommodate for live performances, opera and concerts. Elements of the facade and interior decor were also improved to conform to the new program, as well as a more modern design of the theatre architecture at this time. The Royal is a 1416 seat proscenium theatre with conventional seating spread across four aisles. It contains one balcony, with six loges at the front of the balcony, two side boxes at balcony level, and wheelchair seating at the back left and right of the main floor. The theatre stands out against other theatres in the area through the design of the exterior Broughton St. facade. The four storey building is distinguished through its decorative brick and terracotta tile-work at its main entrance. Its prominent at street level is emphasized by its corner location at Broughton and Blanchard st., as well as the grand arched entrance, which projects slightly with a marquee canopy, and is framed by art glass windows. The top of the facade is decorated with a terracotta cornice above a wide frieze, with a row of lights along the top that illuminate the facade at night. The design of the theatre is inspired from the renaissance and classical revival architecture. Both the exterior and the interior of the theatre demonstrate a similar traditional style of ornamentation. The auditorium holds several authentic details, such as basrelied plasterwork, a deep cantilevered balcony and intact orchestra pit, all of which act as a response to the performing arts style of architecture in the early twentieth century. Panels of deep-colored onyx frame hangings specially imported from Paris, as well as numerous painted murals and decorative motifs, can be admired by visitors on their way to their seats in the theatre. The architects fabricated full size details of the elegant plaster decor in the theatre, a technique used in the time period following the French Revolution. The same strategy was used in the modeling of various construction elements in the theatre, to ensure proper form and durability. In 2006, a Canadian Heritage grant of $900,000 helped a multi-million dollar restoration, also funded by the Capital Regional District. Allan R. Cassidy directed the facade restoration; this work was recognized with awards from Heritage Canada Foundation and Victoria's Hallmark Society. In the renovation, modern elements were added to both contrast and compliment the classical style of architecture used in the theatre. The engineer employed by Rochefort and Sankey used a steel framework for the truss holding the balcony, which is constructed to account for its curved shape. The acoustic properties in the theatre were more effective after this renovation, as it featured the arrangement of a single, cantilevered balcony with more gentle slope. The balcony required no support columns underneath, creating clear sightlines for its viewers. The cantilever ends of the balcony stringers are among the largest used in theatre production in British Columbia. The theatre has been provided praise from its audience, for its comfortable seating, heating and ventilation arrangements and acoustic and lighting properties.

Design, performed an experimental acoustics analysis of four theatres, one of which being The Royal Theatre in Victoria, BC. 60 m His study explores the balance that must be struck between 37 m the performers and the orchestra. optimum balance is +2dB. 24 m It was found that low frequency balance is much lower on the 15 240 m3 orchestra level (see figure 5). Since it is a proscenium arch 1416 seats theatre, the sound on the balcony level is considered to be of 28 m higher quality than the sound on the orchestra level. 17 m For optimal acoustic performance, the balcony should be no 2 476 m deeper than twice its height. The height of the balcony is 48 10.7m3/seat feet and the depth of the balcony is 65 feet. If the balcony were to be deeper than 96 feet, that would cause auditory distortion for the audience seated deep under the balcony. Architects, William D'oyly H. Rochfort and Eben W. Sankey, are responsible for the complete consideration However the balcony overhang causes a sound defect underneath it on the main floor as it creates scattered and design of the balance in the Royal Theatre.

The proscenium opening is 10.01 metres but the ceiling gradually slopes up in order for the data sound to travel to the upper balcony. The coffered ceiling above the balcony enhances clarity of sound as well as provides interesting architectural expression. Sound travelling from the orchestra and the performers extends out towards the audience and reflects off the coffered ceiling which disperses the sound further. The design of the theatre is comprised of a cantilevered balcony as well six boxes located on stage left and right and six loges in the lower balcony overlooking the stage. The pit is very shallow, only 300mm deep and holds about 38 musicians, which is common in many Baroque houses in Europe. The acoustics of the room are influenced in part by the pit depth.

THEATRE HISTORY
In 1960, a plan was conceived by the Honorable Duff Roblin P.C and Maitland B. Steinkopf MBE, QC to create an entire arts district across the new Civic centre to mark Canada's milestone centenary and to start a grand scheme of urban renewal in Winnipeg's Point Douglas area. Later, it would host a concert hall, museum, planetarium, theatre centre and parkade. This project created a lot of controversy as it would cost millions of dollars to be realised over a period of 5 years and would require the demolition of four square blocks. However, promoters of the plan proclaimed that the cost for the realisation of this project would be nothing compared to the way that it would revolutionize Main Street. As seen from the Main Street, the concert hall has an exterior façade of balanced orthogonal lines and angles, glass and masonry, light cream and dark charcoal tones (Photo 2). The colour of the building matches and reflects those of the Winnipeg City Hall, found across the street, which also features Tyndall stone and deep grey masonry. The most outstanding aspect of the façade features a set of forty-five "eyelid-like" concrete window covers. These act as a sunshading awnings and express a modernist aspect of the plasticity of concrete.

As you enter the lobby, through the glazed vestibule, the place is carpeted in deep red. The corridors are accompanied Hence, the Centennial Concert Hall in Winnipeg was built in by a unique undulating chestnut-toned wood walls that create curved entrances to the theatre rooms. The the 1960s as part of the Manitoba Centennial Centre, being proscenium stage has a dimension of approximately 24m the first building for the new arts district. The Centennial wide and 12m deep and over concert hall replaced the Winnipeg Auditorium building 33m tall, which can receive a full orchestra and a choir of 700 (now Manitoba archives) on Vaughan which only had a capacity of 800 seats. Many foundations contributed to the people. In addition to this, the room contains two viewing balconies and two loges, both clad in white stucco.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
The Centennial Concert Hall is acoustically innovative through its use of space, design and materiality. The combination of these aspects create an acoustically effective concert hall of the highest quality even when constructed in 1967. The Centennial Concert Hall follows a traditional continental seating plan, congregating in one area of the hall. This form minimizes aisles running through the seating plan, maximizing the amount of seating and generating an even sound quality throughout the space as seen in Figure 1, Main Floor Plan. The lack of columns allow for uninterrupted sound travelling without reflection back into the centre of the auditorium. Additionally, the ceiling is angled downwards at the back of the hall permitting even sound distribution to the back of the concert hall. This is shown in the Figure 3 Section, as the ceiling height at the rear of the theatre narrows. The section also illustrates the height of the stage in comparison to the concert hall allows for even specular reflection from the stage to the viewers. In 2009, the Centennial Concert Hall was renovated to add new panelling enhancing the current acoustic system and stage sound, and improving the lighting and overall appearance of the performance space. The added acoustic panels are hung significantly lower than the ceiling height, limiting the reverberation time of the travelling sounds. The ceiling acoustic panels follow a convex shape to allow for homogenous sound diffusion throughout the concert hall. Consequently, the specular reflection to the seating areas is improved as illustrated in Figure 4, Specular Reflection Diagram. The undulating shapes of the extruding plasterboard balconies contribute both architectural delight and acoustic quality. Similar to the decorative sculpture used in historic auditoriums, the abstract form of the balconies allow for diffusion of sound within Centennial Concert Hall. Following the convex shape of the ceiling panels, the curved balconies diffuse sound equally throughout the concert hall by reflecting sound to various points throughout. The Centennial Concert hall balconies do not largely overhang the floor level seating and restrict sound to the area below. As a result, scattering effects of diffusion do not occur, thus creating an overall homogenous and pleasant sound. Sound absorption in the concert hall limits the amount of sound reflected back into the space by means of drapery, acoustic panels, and hanging sound travellers. These materials absorb sound waves restricting excess reverberation and reflection within the concert hall. This prevents sound waves from overlapping and altering the intended sound performance. These absorptive materials are more porous, allowing for sound to enter the object and dissipate. The thick drapery and acoustic panels also prevent exterior sounds from entering the concert hall and disturbing the performance space. The simplicity of the form and design of the Centennial Concert Hall creates a successful performance hall both acoustically and spatially. With the addition of effective acoustic paneling and materials, the Centennial Concert Hall is a world-class performance venue in the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba.

THEATRE HISTORY
The Avon Theatre has a rich and diverse history. Originally built in 1901 by architect Harry J. Powell to replace the theatre in Stratford's Town Hall, it was branded as Theatre Albert, after producer Albert Brandenberger. It opened its doors at the beginning of the century, and by 1910, the theatre was renamed The Griffin and advertised by Brandenberger as "The House of Polite Vaudeville and Motion Pictures" (Ashenburg, 1996). The theatre's stage was built as a conventional proscenium-arch theatre, with a fairly large stage and a small orchestra-pit. Later on in 1941, the space was renamed The Avon and was converted to a motion-picture theatre only (Daily Commercial News and Construction Record, 2000). Tom Patterson was a journalist native of Stratford. The town was hit hard by the Depression and he wanted to do something to help its economy and add to its culture. He had an idea for a Shakespeare theatre in a park by the banks of the Avon River. After many trials and much doubt from the theatre community, the Stratford Festival opened in 1953 for a 6-week season in a large rented tent in the park. After worry that no one would travel to small-town Stratford to see the productions, visitors ended up coming not just from a few hours away, but from across the country (McNicoll, 2012, p.257). The first three years saw the stage and auditorium located in this giant tent. After a booming success, however, the Festival Theatre was built in 1956 to permanently house the stage (Stratford Festival, 2016). It was at this time that they began renting the Avon Theatre in addition to the Festival Theatre in order to accommodate for a larger capacity. Seven years later, in 1963, the Festival decided to purchase the theatre and began renovations of the interior in order to include enlarged stage facilities and auditorium seating of about 1,100 (Daily Commercial News and Construction Record, 2000). These were led by designer Tanya Moiseiwitsch, who also designed the Festival Theatre stage ten years earlier (Historica Canada, 2016). There have been a number of renovations over the years, including the exterior in 1967, and interior renovations in 1975, and in 1981 to improve the conditions of the room. In 1985, a 3storey, 44,000 sq foot addition was

added in order to incorporate rehearsal halls, a scene shop, workshops, and production support areas (Daily Commercial News and Construction Record, 2000). In 2000, in preparation for the Stratford Festival's 50 year anniversary, the company received $1,000,000 grant from Stratford City Council in order to renovate the Avon Theatre as part of a $12,000,000 renovation project for the house. This included building and acoustics renovation, and a redesign of the front entrance in 2002, as well as the addition of a new building, called Studio Theatre, for small performances (Stratford Festival 2016). Stratford Festival started out as just an idea that one Stratford journalist had. By the end of the 20th century, it had grown from this stage, to an event located in a single large tent, to multiple buildings often filled by 10,000 people in just one weekend (McNicoll, 2012, p.257).

This expansion introduced the issue of the air handling unit noise and lack of definition of sound underneath the balconies, as well as other acoustic problems (Daily Commercial News and Construction Record). To deal with this problem, the existing mirrored wall surfaces were replaced with acoustic panels (Dingwall, 2002, p. 30-33). The whole theatre area was carpeted, the ground floor received new seating and the balcony seats were refurbished (Dingwall). The issue of "slap echo" occurring from the balcony was dealt with by cladding the balcony in wood (Dingwall). Since the renovations, there has been positive feedback in terms of sound quality (Dingwall).

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE

The theater is a rectangle. The ground floor seating is arranged at a slight slope upwards away from the stage, and it is arranged in a linear fashion. The interior wall finishes are not known, therefore the reverberation time cannot be calculated. It is known that acoustic panels are used to clad the walls and wood cladding is used to clad the balconies to reduce slapback. The seats are finished with a red velvet material to help with the absorption of sound. Chris Shaw, the chief audio engineer states that the Avon Theatre runs on the Meyer Sound LCS Series and loudspeaker system (Meyer Sound News, 2007). He saw the theatre through a period of great change as he was acting chief audio engineer from 1983 to 2002 (Dingwall, 2002, p. 30-33). The theatre was also renovated in 1975 and 1981, the first time was to improve the interior conditions, and the second time was to improve the acoustics (Dingwall).

FIRST ONTARIO PERFORMING ARTS CENTRE
CITY: ADDRESS: ACOUSTICS CONSULTANT: ARCHITECT: OWNER: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: St. Catherines, Ontario 250 St. Paul Street Jaffe Holden Diamond Schmitt Architect City of St. Catherines and Brock University $60 000 000 2015

THEATRE HISTORY
In recent years the City of St. Catherines has been making efforts to revitalize their downtown core. Urban planners, city council members, and other professionals have been call to turn the area into a destination to arrive to rather than a place to drive by. With these goals in mind, sport facilities, an aquatics centre, and other public buildings were recently designed and built. Amongst these buildings is the FirstOntario Performing Arts Centre, designed by Diamond Schmitt Architects. Located in the heart of downtown St. Catherines, this building serves as a successful urban renewal project for the City. Within St. Catherines, FirstOntario Performing Arts Centre is located adjacent to Brock University's Marilyn I. Walker School of Fine and Performing Arts (also designed by Diamond Schmitt Architects) allowing for collaboration between the two groups. The University also has access to spaces within the building such as the recital hall and projection theatre, allowing the building to be used by both professionals and students. Until the completion of this performing arts centre, the city had been lacking a good performance facility that was sufficient in seating and acoustics; often local artist groups would practice in churches that provided sub-par acoustical spaces and end up performing in Toronto. Therefore this building is a performing centre for both foreign and local artists- for them to practice, rehearse, and perform. Additionally it is a community hub for the people of St. Catherines and Brock University. Immersed in heavy pedestrian and vehicular circulation everyday by downtown goers and university student, this building is a prime culture centre for the city. The north facade on St. Paul Street is clad with honeycolored brick masonry and a glazed curtain wall which allows views into the lobby space. This also serves as the main entrance for the public; when one enters the building the main circulation runs east to west along the north allowing for simple circulation. In elevation the building contrasts the heavy masonry with the lightness of glazed elements. This is seen in both the north and south facades. Though the north end of the building is programmatically the front of the building, the south provide people with a unique experience. On the south side (facing Brock), parts of the building cantilevers off a hill. The unique experience is seen when seeing the contrast between the urban street front of the north and natural hills of the south. FirstOntario Performing Arts Centre is the result of a partnership between the City of St. Catherines and Brock University. Though the 95 000 sqft project cost $60 000 000, the Federal government funded $18 000 000, the Province of Ontario funded an additional $18 000 000, the city funded $19 000 000, and $7 500 000 was raised by the community. One of the reasons for this building's success was its abundance in budget which was a result of the community's commitment to a new performing arts centre. The Centre is comprised of four performance spaces: a 781 seat adjustable hall (Partridge Hall), a 200 seat black box theatre(Robertson Theatre), a 304 seat recital hall (Cairns Recital hall), and a 199 seat film theatre, the latter two made available to Brock University. In this report, Partridge Hall will be discussed and analyzed. The Partridge Hall is located on the east end of the building with the stage and backstage on the south. As people enter in from the north they are faced with a grand space clad with wooden elements; repetition in the wood slats covering all walls are visually intriguing but also serves an acoustical purpose. Overall the hall gives a sense of prestige but also intimacy because of its materiality. This is the essence that the architect was designing for; a space that is grand and can house the best of performers but also humble so that it can interact with the city as a whole.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
A list of acoustic elements in Partridge Hall includes: -curved wood scallop panels -acoustic fabric and curtains -concrete block panels -curved wood pivot panels on the left and right side of stage -curved wood panels above stage and audience area The walls of the hall are wrapped by curved wood scallop panels, behind are a layer of acoustic curtain that can be drawn up or let down, and lastly behind the curtain are concrete block panels. During unamplified or acoustic performances, the curtain is raised allowing sound to travel pass the scallop panels (an acoustically transparent membrane) and be reflected and diffused by the concrete panels, creating a grand symphonic sound and experience. During amplified and electrical performances, curtains can be drawn down to absorb the reflected and resonant sound. Because the curtains are maintained behind the wooden scallop panels, the visual quality of the space remains constant as acoustical qualities change. Curved wood panels are suspended from above the stage to reflect sound towards the audience. These panels can be raised, lowered or rotated to accommodate for different performances. Pivot panels located on the side of stage contain reflective material on one side and absorptive material on the other, it is also electronically controlled allowing performers to angle the panels with precision to reflect or absorb sound. The wooden stage is made of a steel framework allowing for a large cavity that is underneath the stage, when playing bass-intense string instruments, the sound is amplified. Additionally, balcony fronts are clad in curved wood panels that reflect sound upwards and downwards. Ultimately the acoustic design of Partridge Hall is reflective of the buildings philosophy- to provide the city of St. Catherines a performance space that can accommodate various local and foreign artists. Doors and walls of the hall are soundproofed in order to not disturb other spaces in the building such as other halls, lobby, etc. To help with this, air flow in and out of the room can be controlled and slowed down to transfer less sound energy.

THEATRE HISTORY
The McIntyre Performing Arts Centre resides within the Mohawk College located in Hamilton, Ontario. The college was built in 1967 after the establishment of the Ontario's College system in 1966. The theatre was initially known as the Mohawk College Theatre and was formally open to the campus and its community in 1971, creating a wave of talented and beautiful productions of art to develop as a result. The inspiration for the design of the theatre was based of The O'Keefe Centre (formally now known as The Sony Centre for the Performing Arts) in Toronto. Their appreciation for the aesthetical and acoustical qualities translated in the planning of the layout and also the equipment set up such LED light fixtures, stereo and audio configurations such as a six inputcentre cluster audio system, and the seating arrangements. The stage is crafted from maple and pine to adhere to stress of larger orchestral performances while maintaining a premium appeal. A production called Theatre Aquarius had been the first major performance to be held inside the Mohawk College as it was a local production company. Since then, the McIntyre Performing Arts has hosted a plethora of acts in its venue over the years since it opened for the campus and the public in the 70s, housing roughly 1.4 performances daily, all year round. It has hosted few local productions in the city such as the Hamilton Music Awards along with many more esteemed productions in and outside the city. Various events are also held in the venue through social media and box office services allowing for convenient access to the modern productions such as A Very Frozen Musical set to held on March 2016. Below lists a few performances and events held within the theatre: · Clara Hughes · Brott Music Festival · Gail Vaz-Oxlade · Jimmie Vaughan · CBC Townhalls · Q with Jian Ghomeshi

· Hamilton Philharmonic Youth Orchestra · Wild Kratts In 1981, the theatre was renamed after Mohawk College's President Keith McIntyre in honour of his 16 years of service and leadership. Along with his commemoration, the McIntyre Theatre had undergone various retrofits such as state-of-the-art acoustical equipment upgrades as well as a few additional seats integrated within the main floor and mezzanine area, accumulating a total of 1,029 seats since 1998 to the present. When the arts community of Hamilton understood the value of the theatre locating in Mohawk College and the potential it held for local and foreign performances to be brought into mainstream, the McIntyre Theatre was once again retitled the McIntyre Performing Arts Centre on June 2011. With their recent upgrades, the McIntyre Performing Arts Centre prides itself in offering a friendly environment to focus on the arts as well as wishes to help elevate and contribute to the growing arts industry for its community.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
Name and place of the room tested: Mcintyre Theatre for the Performing Arts Room type: For speech (also used as a lecture hall), music and performances (plays). Theatre type: Fan Type plan with a balcony Wall composition: Brick (of varying heights along the longitudinal axis) with Wood resonator absorbers extending above the brick to the ceiling. Reverberation Time (figure 5): The reverberation time of approximately 0.2 seconds indicates that the theatre is more optimally used as a lecture hall and not so much an orchestra. Curtains (figure 8): Depending on the performance at a given time, a layer of curtain is used. The cyclorama drop, for instance, is used for creating the illusion of "infinity" and is mostly used to simulate backgrounds on stage. Complications with Acoustics in the Space: There is a cavity of approximately 9.9m under the balcony of the theatre (see figure 3). This cavity is quite deep and has the potential for an array of acoustical problems. Its configuration is probably resultant of the maximization of spectator seating. The surface treatment of the walls, ceiling, and floor of this space seems to have been given special consideration due to this loss of optimal acoustics. For instance, adding hard surfaces throughout can cause fluttering effects; this phenomenon is described as the onset of a small succession of echoes within the surfaces of a rectangular space. Conversely, cladding this area in highly porous and absorptive materials such as foams, carpets and drapery can effectively diminish the liveliness of the sound in the space. The existing material used here is brick (for the walls), carpet (for the floor), and a convex diffuser on the ceiling (see figure 9 for reference). The mixture of these three materials - not including the seating or spectators) - and their configuration within the space, can create an adequate environment for experiencing a live vocal and orchestral performance within this nook.

theatre HISTORY
The legacy of music director Raffi Armenian lies in the transformation of the Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony. The KW Symphony was organized in 1945 when a group of individuals from the city's choir suggested the need for an orchestra. They began as a group of mixed level musicians until the leadership of Raffi Armenian. Leading the amateur orchestra in 1971, Armenian evolved the group of musicians into a professional symphony until his leave in 1993. The Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony preformed their first concert in their hometown which promoted the enthusiasm of residents to build a permanent home for the orchestra. In September of 1980, the City of Kitchener opened the Centre in the Square. The main theatre room, named after the famous music director, was designated as the Raffi Armenian Theatre. The concert hall remains the permanent home of the group of musicians and hosts dozens of performers from around the world throughout the year. The Centre in the Square is regarded as a non-profit organization dedicated to the performing arts. Funded annually $1.4 million for operational costs by the owner City of Kitchener as well as with charitable donations and ticket sales, the Centre has remained opened and successful for over 30 years. The Centre includes the main Raffi Armenian Theatre along with an art gallery as well as a flexible performance space for an audience of 300. The Centre in the Square was designed by Architects Rieder, Hymmen and Lobban. The theatre itself was designed in partnership with Artec which specializes in theatre performance spaces. Russell Johnson, the founder of Artec, was the leading acoustic technician in the design of the Raffi Armenian Theatre. Since Russell Johnson is still known as the most specialized and precise North American acoustic consultant of the 20th and 21st century, the theatre of study directly reflects the skills of the individual. Highly acclaimed for the flexibility and acoustical qualities, the room contains several unique design features which award it one of the best in North America. The boundary wall of the stage is a critical aspect of the design. Two towers at the back of the stage form a curvilinear backdrop for the performers. However, in the case of a larger orchestra, the towers can then be moved on air bearings to accommodate for more people and will serve as sound reflectors. The fore-stage can also be transformed into an orchestra platform, a pit for 110 musicians or for additional audience seating. The large theatre seats an audience of 2047 making the design accommodations highly required for optimal acoustic quality. Each seat in the theatre is both acoustically and visually accommodated to provide the highest experiential quality for the viewer. Raffi Armenian recalls his first rehearsal with the Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony after the completion of the Centre in the Square, "We realized that we had great acoustics. Acoustics are never completely foolproof and to really hit the top was quite exciting." The theatre was not only designed for the intention of live performance but also for recording and broadcasting. Therefore, Artec focused their efforts during the preliminary design to minimize the excessive use of expensive sound dampers by strategically concealing the equipment which would create background noise. Laying out the plan and section of the theatre was also a major acoustical aid for the space and was continued by Artec into the design development and construction phase. The construction of the Centre in the Square and especially the Raffi Armenian Theatre transformed the reputation of the city of Kitchener. As a centre without capital share, the theatre focuses on the importance of the performance arts and has become a success for its quality of sound. Kitchener has become a destination to those who are both fanatics of the symphony as well as those who are not yet. The quality of the sound within the hall speaks for itself.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
The Raffi Armenian Theatre is hailed as not only an architectural jewel, but a shining example of acoustic supremacy in Canada. To understand how the theatre possesses exceptional acoustic qualities we must first begin in the early 60s when acoustic consultants were attempting to create ratios capable of shaping spaces that possessed incredibly high levels of acoustic quality. Bolt, Beranek, and Newman were keen to invoke the notion of the optimum ratio of early to late sound. These subjective ratios were first published by Beranek in 1962. Later on, West, published his own findings based on Beranek's work. West found a correlation between Beranek's subjective ratios and the height-to-width ratios of the halls. This discovery proved to be significant for sound design at the time, as it showed the "importance of early lateral reflections," (Barron, 2009, p.117) which played in the design of theatres and concert halls. North American Consultant Russell Johnson was one of the first to respond enthusiastically to the idea of lateral sound reflections in architecture. From 1954 to 1970 Johnson worked with Bolt, Beranek and Newman on a variety of projects including many multi-purpose auditoriums that implemented this suspended array philosophy. This technique consisted of a vast amount of panels arranged in a fashion that would help reflect vertical sound out towards the audience. The system could be arranged and re-arranged in a variety of positions and heights to create the optimal acoustic setting for the performance taking place. Once he had established his own practice, Russell Johnson dropped the array philosophy and adopted the idea of continuous canopies instead. These canopies carried over many of the founding principles of the array, but contained significantly fewer components. The canopy was to be suspended in free space over the front stage, continuing out over the first few rows of the audience, and therefore project sound throughout the theatre. The Raffi Armenian Theatre in the Centre in the Square Building in Kitchener Ontario is an example of the many auditoriums Johnson designed with the continuous canopy. The Raffi Armenian Theatre uses continuous canopy system as the "chief instrument for clarity, intelligibility and articulation." (Johnson in Barron, 2009, p. 118) The entire canopy system is full adjustable in height. The height changes depending on the performance in the space to ensure the best acoustic quality for the medium. By using this system, the theatre possess a reverberation time of 2.4 seconds. Improvements have been made to theatre over the years, but as Bob Luffman, Head Sound Engineer at the Centre in the Square, said "no major change to that decay time has been noticed or challenged." (personal communication, February 3, 2016)

Besides the Canopy there are a variety of other elements that contribute to the sound quality of the space. The balconies contain soffit reflectors and parallel side walls to enhance the early reflections. The ceiling however, is profiled in such a way to re-distribute ceiling reflections throughout the space. Another technical design for acoustics used on stage are the two towers previously mentioned. These towers provide a variety of possibilities depending on the performance. They can either function as additional seating, locating the audience to the sides of the stage, or they can be used as lighting perches for theatrical performances or musical shows. But in terms of sounds manipulation, they can be arranged on the stage in such a way that they create an acoustic shell for orchestral performances. This then creates a space that reflects all sound out over the audience improving clarity and strength as well as the overall quality of the space. In addition, by horizontally closing off the fly tower, the void beyond the towers acts as a reverberation chamber to provide secondary reverberation for concert performance. Finally massive construction was used to minimize the bass absorption for a quality bass sound level. All of these elements play a major role in the acoustics of the space, but the smaller details layered into the design influenced the greater quality of the theatre greatly. The shell is made from cinder blocks that are filled with sand for soundproofing, then painted with epoxy paint. This helps create sound insulation in the space, isolating it from outside noise. The theatre space contains no carpet on the floors, but the walls have a convex shape and motorized drapes to alter the reverberation time in the auditorium as required. The events leading up to it construction, and the many techniques used to construct and shape it come together to help make the Raffi Armenian Theatre a world-class concert hall. Many recognize the space as one of the best in Canada, and hopefully the steps taken to create this space will one day contribute to even greater acoustic spaces throughout the world.

THEATRE HISTORY
The city of Guelph was founded by John Galt which was assisted by his surveyor in planning the community. He placed public spaces of different shapes that defined the unique street design provided one of the earliest examples of town planning in Ontario. Over the years many examples of various types of architecture have contributed to enrich of the downtown area. Some of these buildings include a warm-hued limestone which was easily worked by stone carvers. The local limestone has contributed a splendid unity and visual distinction to the architecture of the community. Many fine examples of historic stone architecture remain intact and in a state of commendable preservation. River Run centre has one of the most significant Theatre spaces. It was constructed in 1995 and is located along the Speed River in the historic downtown core close to where the city was first founded. River Run is owned by the city of Guelph, and was designed by it's people to facilitate a premier stage for concerts, musicals, plays, dance, and family shows. Before this centre, there was a skating rink that was constructed in 1882, where fancy carnivals and balls were regular fare. Then the rink was converted into a warehouse, which was destroyed in a fire in 1991. The stoned from the front of the the building were reused when constructing the facade in the parkland in front of River Run centre. In the main entrance there is a dramatic copper art installation which captures the part of River Run centre which was created by Guelph artist Peter Johnston. Part of the intent of this installation is to show the history of the site, mainly the Attawandaron, the aboriginal people who lived before the European settlement. John Galt's portrait and excerpts from Galt's journal are also found which dramatize Guelph's founding in 1827. You can also find a railway tracks, a scale model cars, the first town plan and an aerial view of the church our Lady represent different facets of the city's history. The limestone facade of the skating rink has stood on the site for the last 100 years, is incorporated into the landscape of John Galt Park. John Galt was honored by the Canada company hall by establishing the city in the name of the Canada company. Charter members of the new Canada Company contributed generously to the River Run Centre, built on the site if Guelph's beginning. There is a spectacular glazed wall on the Canada company hall provides guests with a panoramic view of the river and the festivities around it.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE

In order to meet the needs of being able to display both electronically amplified, and acoustically amplified events, the theatre space needed to have systems in play that would allow it to remain flexible across all performance types. Electronically amplified sound benefits from being emitted from multiple sources in a room with acoustically dampening properties, and traditional acoustic music or performance sounds the best in an environment with greater resonation, in order to deliver a warmer and richer sound. In order to address these opposing needs, a system of acoustically absorbent curtains was designed and installed around the entire interior of the main theatre space. In order to accommodate both extremes, the highly acoustically absorbent curtains cover an acoustically reflective wall treatment. The curtains are deployed completely for events that require a more dampened environment, and retracted into wall pockets when a more reverberant room is far more desirable. Because of the variability inherent in the system, it allows a great deal of flexibility for delivering any combination of acoustic performance, where it is possible to fine tune and adjust the system to meet the needs of the event being held. The curtain system is designed to be relatively discreet when not in use. Additionally, there were many other technological and material considerations in place to achieve a more desirable auditory and visual experience. Ranging from variable speaker arrangements for electronic sound, to choices of trim, panels and wall treatments where a curtain system cannot be used. The design resolved a highly specific treatment of the structural and roof conditions, specifying poured concrete on a steel deck with 2 inches of acoustic insulation, as well as solid wood maple panels acting as ornamentation enclosing some of the more structural elements in the hall like columns or floor slabs. In the back stage, they make use of a unique system to address the variable usage of the stage space and the acoustic needs of a given production.

THEATRE HISTORY
A man named George Bernard Shaw started the Shaw Festival in the summer to showcase his works to the public. As this event became increasingly more popular there was a need for a theatre to house this big summer event, designed by Ron Thom in the late 1970's the Shaw Festival Theatre, conceived out of popular demand, contains 850 seats and looks over the commons and federal parkland. These restaurants and terraces are connected to a sunken courtyard which acts as a social hub and a new gathering space for the people outside the theatre.

An additional large rehearsal space was created and the size matches that of the actual theatre itself. The concrete columns that are the structure for this large rehearsal space are pulled inwards into the space about a meter and The design of the theatre was first imaged with a simple a half to create a circular zone around the perimeter and sketch. The sketch consists of a lot of green space and "adjustable fabric baffles at the column line enable the room composed of simple shapes and geometry placed together. to be blacked out, acoustically dampened, and planned to This design has a relationship with the designs of Frank Lloyd simulate different stage layouts."(Page 62, The Architectural Wright's estate.

Furthermore, a more quiet entrance was created along the production centre. The long more quiet entrance branches off into a separate foyer. This foyer has a long strip skylight that lights the entire space and creates a visual connection where the new renovation meets the old theatre building. This foyer leads into a larger rehearsal space/ multi-purpose room. This new renovation also included restaurant and garden terraces.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
The Shaw Festival Theatre has seating accommodations for 860 people, and produces many adaptations of George Shaw's plays. Such a theatre requires many considerations when discussing its successes and failures. The theatre is mainly made from wood, with wood being present in the ceiling, flooring, and walls. The British Columbia cedar used helps reflect sound and provides the space with adequate indoor lighting despite being enclosed. The theatre's form itself is proscenium. Proscenium theatres have the advantages that everyone can see the stage adequately, however, this does not imply they all receive a good sightline. In fact, proscenium theatres have a disadvantage of poor sightlines, especially for those under the balcony shaping. The seats under the balcony have a particularly poor visual and acoustical experience, but this is to be considered normal in accommodating for as large an audience as required by program. The motion of fanning out as one performs on stage helps the propagation of sound. The floor plan accomodates the large amount of sound, as it is an open corridor, it also has good sound absorption panels so that no outside noise can disturb the performance. Wood in acoustics has very useful qualities of controlling sound and its paths. The theatre utilises this in reflecting sound by ceiling panels and wall panels, as the walls undulate rectilinearly as one travels down the aisles of seating. The reflecting panels prove to be highly successful as many reviews of the Shaw Festival Theatre productions state that the audio in the theatre is very rich. The seating is made from fabric and is upholstered which helps to decrease the reverberation time to one that is one performance satisfactory. The reverberation time as calculated is very good considering the large volume of the space, and taking into account the large stage. The roof is strategically shaped to take advantage of useful sound reflections. The theatre has become more technologically advanced since its completion, with many new additions to the audio system. There is a sophisticated amount of technology in producing the sound and working with the architecture. One of the original project architects, Peter S. Smith, has been a part of the renovations and addition of the Production centre, which is maybe why the project has sensitivity to it. The sensitivity to the acoustics has been portrayed in the continuing use of the materials of wood and other materials available plentiful in the Niagara region.-

SONY CENTER FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS
CITY: ADDRESS: ACOUSTICS CONSULTANT ARCHITECT: OWNER: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: RESTORATION DATE: Toronto, Ontario 1 Front Street East Aercoustics Engineering Ltd. Peter Dickinson (Page & Steele) City of Toronto $12,000,000 ($30M for renovations) 1960 1996

THEATRE HISTORY
The Sony Centre for Performance Arts at 1 Front Street East has been an entertainment venue for musicals, ballets and symphonies since its grand opening almost 56 years ago. It was known as the O'Keefe Centre from 1960 to 1996. This multi-purpose theatre was renamed the Hummingbird Centre, until Sony became the chief sponsor. The Sony Centre was closed due to an extensive restoration process to the existing building. Firms like KPMB were significant contributors to the renovations. Popular bands like David Bowie, Bob Dylan, and Led Zeppelin have all played at the Sony Centre. Considered by many, the Sony Centre's design was state-of-the-art due to its large cantilevered canopy and superior architectural acoustics. Located on a heritage site, the city dubbed it as the largest soft seat theatre in Toronto. In 2008, the Sony Centre would undergo a two-year $30M renovation and restoration process to restore the lavish and grandeur of architect Peter Dickinson's original O'Keefe Centre. The project was separated into two phases. Phase one, which included restoration and renovations, occurred during June 2008 to October 2010. Over 200 trade's people were hired. In 2011, Phase two initiated the construction of a new permanent backstage facility and the "L Tower", a 57-storey residential tower designed by Daniel Libeskind. This four storey building consists of three main forms: the entrance block, auditorium and fly tower. Basic floor breakdown is symmetrical and the floor plan is mostly open. It was important that the original materials were intact during the restoration process. Materials applied consist of Alabama limestone, glass, granite, cooper, bronze, carrara marble, carpet, etc. Wood especially took 6 months to restore. Upon entering the front entrance the marquee or canopy catches the eye as an iconic part of the Sony Centre. The overall shape is bulky and heavy. The canopy was a prime example of concrete construction methods in Toronto during the 1960.

The intent of the architect in the expression of the form was to create a heavy, large, linear element which would complement the heavy, horizontal nature of the building itself. The structure and formal expression is accomplished through the use of cantilevered reinforced concrete slabs, which are supported by poured in place reinforced concrete columns. The Sony Centre is a classic example of a large post war fan shaped theatre. It serves as a good representation of a proscenium arch theatre. As it journeys on its 50th anniversary season, the Sony Centre historical performances, state-of-the-art technologies, acoustics and restored architecture, brings relevance and sophistication to 21st century Toronto audiences.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
s

As the theatre evolved and technology grew, acoustic concerns started to arise. Complaints of lack of loudness and echoes were just some of the concerns. Theatres like the Sony Centre have two sound sources in acoustically dissimilar rooms and an audience in a third equally dissimilar room. These two sound sources are the stage and the orchestra pit. One of the acoustic goals of a theatre is the balance of singers on stage and musicians in the orchestra pit. High and low frequency must be balance between the stage, orchestra pit and the balcony. Sony Centre was in desperate need of a restoration that would improve sound quality. John O'Keefe of Aercoustics Engineering Ltd., was the acoustics consultant during the renovations. Data was collected from the Sony Centre (referred to as the O'Keefe Center) to test the reflection density and attenuation on stages and rehearsal hall. The sound source was a dodecahedron with 75 mm drivers. It was administered at a height of 1.1 m on the stage. Self-measurements were done at a 1 m distance from the sound. Over twenty theaters and performance halls were tested but the measurements for Sony Centre were not released. All measurements were made on an unoccupied stage and the paper concluded that revised theory is the appropriate tool for calculate sound levels on a stage. The Sony Centre is an example of a mid-twentieth century Modern performing arts venue. One of the joys of the Sony Centre is allowing audience members the sense that the sound is surrounding them. One of its acoustic features is the application of optimized curved diffusers on the side walls. During the renovations, the performance hall was going to need a reverberation enhancement system. One of the problems with adding this component is the Sony Centre's fan shaped performance hall. It is common with fan shaped halls that if sources are on the side, than echoes across the width of the audience can be heard. Sound created from the stage did not make echoes, only artificial reflections were generated from the side walls. Instead of treating the echoes with absorption, diffusers were added to break up lateral reflections in the audience section. In 1996, part of a $5M grant from the software developer Hummingbird Corporation, was used to address the reported acoustical problems. The LARES electro-acoustic enhancement system was used to identify any potential sound problems.

theatre history
The National Arts Centre of Canada was part of a series of buildings built in celebration of Canada's 100th birthday in 1967. The construction of the building fell behind and was not built in time for the nations birthday, however, it opened two years later in 1969. The building was designed by Fred Lebensold of Affleck, Desbarats, Dimakopoulos, Lebensold, and Sise Architects. The Centennial building program in which the National Arts Centre was apart of, was a major point in Canada's architectural history. The building was recognized as a significant twentieth century architectural landmark. Canada's Prime Minister at the time, Lester B. Pearson wanted something special for Ottawa to celebrate the countries 100th birthday and the National Arts Centre was built in response to this. Leading the project was G. Hamilton Southam, an exdiplomat and a friend of Pearson. While the Prime Minister defended the project in parliament, Southam made sure the construction of the building was first-class to ensure the amazing quality of the building and the performance spaces. Southam also became the buildings first Director General. In dedication to Southam's work on the building, the main performance hall was named Southam Hall. The National Arts Centre became Canada's most significant showcase for the performing arts; it includes classical music, variety of theatre, dance, and community programming. The building has four performance spaces, the largest being Southam Hall, and Theatre, a Studio, and a smaller, more intimate space, created in 2000. The National Arts Centre attracted performance artist from around the world including popular performers such as Barbara Streisand, Gordon Lightfoot, Neil Young, and Bare Naked Ladies, as well as major touring theatrical productions. During the sixties and seventies, funding cutbacks to the National Arts Centre from the government brought instability to the centre. The hosting of performances depended on the funding from the government. This part of the buildings history is known as "the dark years". With television expanding, the National Arts Centre became involved with an electronic medium which ultimately
83

brought them out of the dark times due to cutbacks on funding. The National Arts Centre has had a defining role for the performing arts in Canada and is still one of the most significant theatres in the country. The building is planned to have a renovation marking Canada's 150th birthday. The renovation is designed by Diamond and Schmitt Architects and will begin construction in 2017.

acoustics of the space
The Southam Theatre is the largest theatre at the NAC that seats 2323 people. The theatre is made up of six sections; the stage, front orchestra, orchestra, mezzanine, amphitheatre and balcony. Each level has its own set of boxes and the mezzanine level has the State Box where royalty, heads of state or VIP guests are seated. This theatres acoustics are ideal for many types of events and performances such as orchestral music, lectures, ceremonies, films, musical acts, opera, ballet, Broadway musicals and many more. All of the theatres at the NAC take the shape of a hexagon. These symmetrical shapes allow for an even distribution of sound to all the levels of seating. This shape has a similar effect as the rectangular or shoebox shaped theatres because Photo 3: Box Seating each pair of walls are parallel. This design has a risk of creating flutter echoes but this theatre has some factors that avoid it.

The ceiling is also leveled/tiered but in a circular shape and it is not flat or parallel to the floor and that decreases the possibility of a flutter echo. The reflectors on the ceiling are vertical (set at a 90 degree angle to the ceiling) and arranged in a radial pattern. This means that the sound is not reflected directly back to the audience. The walls are not solid but have many slits in them that allow for the sound to travel through them instead of reflecting back into the center of the room. Upcoming renovations to the NAC in 2017 are going to be focused on the exterior appearance of the building and making sure that external sounds do not enter the theatres and distract from the performances. These renovations are led by Diamond and Schmitt Architects and they will mostly focus on the three smaller theatres. Overall, the Southam hall is one of the biggest performance halls in the world that has the best acoustics.

THEATRE HISTORY
Located on Kingston's historic waterfront along the shore of Lake Ontario, the Isabel Bader Centre for Performing Arts is an 80,000-square-foot facility dedicated to education and showcasing of the creative and performance arts at Queen's University. Designed by Snohetta in collaboration with N45 Architects, the Isabel Bader Centre's main feature is the 566seat Concert Hall intended for various types of live performances, from small jazz ensembles to classical music orchestras. As an addition to the Queen's University campus, the facility also houses a 150-seat black box theatre, classrooms, an art gallery, a film screening room, and labs serving the school's drama, music, art, as well as film & media departments. Sun-lit rehearsal spaces also frame views of the waterfront and surrounding landscape. The Isabel Bader Centre is a result of the architects' close collaboration with the client, municipality, as well as acoustic, historic preservation, and theatre design consultants. The main concert hall was conceived as a "building within a building"; the room is enclosed in two-foot thick concrete walls, making it independent of the surrounding structure of the overall building. As a result, sound from outside of the hall is muffled and the performances taking place inside are free of disruptions. In addition, the HVAC system was designed to reduce vibrations as fresh air is quietly supplied into the space. The shape of the performance hall was designed in collaboration with acousticians at Arup, using Virtual SoundLab technology and digital 3D modeling to conduct sound studies in order achieve a form that would allow for optimum acoustic performance. Furthermore, the concert hall's interior space is finished in layered wood that was chosen for its acoustic and aesthetic quality. The pattern itself is a reference to the geology of the local area, which is notable for its limestone. The Isabel Bader Centre also preserves the site's architectural heritage by incorporating the pre-existing 19th century Morton Brewery and stable buildings, reusing their materials in the new construction. For instance, reclaimed wood from the previous structure and flooring was adapted in parts of the interior cladding. Adjacent to the facility is the city-owned Tett Centre for Creativity and Learning; together with the Isabel Bader Centre, the building complex forms an educational and cultural hub for the arts. The Isabel Bader Centre for Performing Arts is also a winner of the 2015 Lieutenant Governor's Award presented by the Ontario Association of Architects (OAA).

The team also developed a Virtual SoundLab technology which is a space that can recreate the acoustics of different spaces based on their design and measured before it is even built. With the use of these technology, ARUP shaped a visually pleasant interior that provides surface texture, optimum level of sound diffusion and specular reflection of sound. The design also allows for great live acoustical musical performances, to optimum the sound quality without depending on electronic amplification. One of the final test to fine-tune the acoustics in the concert hall involves firing a pistol in the empty hall. Frequency, direction and timing of the sound are being measured in the test. Figure 5 shows a graphical representation of the sound of pistol reflecting off form different parts of the room and arriving at the listener with yellow being the latest (200 milliseconds) and red being the earliest (15 milliseconds).

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
The Isabel Bader Centre for Performing Arts consists of a classic shoebox form and a N1 acoustic rating which is mainly designed as a classical music theatre that is appropriately suited for classical music performances. In order to optimize the acoustics quality for performances, Acousticians at ARUP imposed different design strategies and new technology in this Isabel concert hall. Two foot concrete thick walls are being used to muffle noise and any exterior sound. The interior curved walls also provide lively acoustic sound and reduce echo in the concert hall. The interior walls are formed by smaller pieces of wood that jut out in a slight angles. These angled wood are equivalent of fine tuning. All the walls of the concert hall do not touch any other parts of the building directly which minimizes the exterior noise and sound. The shape and form of the concert hall was driven by both acoustic consultant ARUP and project consultants Snøhetta and N45 to design a dynamic and intimate performance space for both audiences and performers. The design wrap the audience around the concert hall which leads to a more centralized acoustic environment from the stage while the balcony seating enhances the dynamic atmosphere. Different from the old classical concert hall design with fine level of ornamentation and fenestration, the Isabel Bader Centre for Performing Arts would like to create a more modern architecture with unique acoustic signatures. ARUP overcame this problem by applying special wall panelling design to shape the sound in the concert hall. Another special feature applied in the design is the distinctive acoustic drapery that can be deployed over the sections of the side walls and also be adapted with a flick of switch to accommodate the needs of rock bands, chamber groups and orchestras by providing sound absorption and lower the reverberation time. This allows the concert hall to be more customized based on different musical performances. Collaborated with the firm Snøhetta, the acoustic design team ARUP used a special 3D design modeling program which helps to conduct sound studies and turn proposed

CITY: ADDRESS: ACOUSTICS C+ONSULTANT: ARCHITECT: OWNER: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: Thunder Bay, Ontario 1 Paul Shaffer Drive Artec Consultants Fraser Browne and Tett, Associated Architects City of Thunder Bay $7,000,000 1985

THEATRE HISTORY
The Thunder Bay Community Theatre is seen as the heart of the community, hosting numerous events and countless patrons since its opening in 1985. Located at 1 Paul Shaffer Drive, only a five minute drive from Lakehead University, the theatre sits comfortably in Thunder Bay both from a community and geographical standpoint. The design of the building done by Fraser Browne and Tett, Associated and Artec Consultants, goes above and beyond its technical requirements. The theatre is widely accepted as one of the premier rooms in North America. Not only is the room perfect for performance, but through the years it has hosted many non-performance based events due to the flexibility of the space. This versatility is demonstrated in the theatre's ability to accommodate for greater numbers of people with an orchestra pit lift that can also extend the stage into the audience chamber. Roughly 2000m2 of pedestrian area within the building includes a large main lobby and mezzanine lobby both suitable for performances/gatherings in their own right. The

large main theatre area holds roughly 1500 seats with the ability to range from a large, formal space to a more intimate cabaret style theatre. The theatre also houses the Thunder Bay Community Auditorium Foundation dedicated to providing the community with access to cultural, entertainment and arts events hosted there and providing grants to up-and-coming performers wishing to host a performance within the venue.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
The auditorium is furnished with 1500 seats. The room is 38m long, 22m wide, and 20m in height, creating a volume of 16720m3. The stage is 21m wide and 28m deep with a total surface area of 594m2. The volume of the room for each seat is 11m3. The audience chamber area is 868m2 and the orchestral lift is 102m2. These sizes affect reverberance which is dependent on surface and material properties. The acoustical qualities of this space is characterized by its flexibility in housing theatrical performances including rock music, vocally-intensive acts and symphonies with a grand piano provided by the facility. The concert ceiling panels are capable of enclosing the Fly Tower. The canopy ceiling is movable, capable of being adjusted according to the acoustical demands of the performance. Raising and lowering the ceiling reflects sound waves in different angles, projecting the sound deeper into the space or directing it evenly among the audience. To alter the room's geometries and achieve acoustical clarity, fourteen large panels at 26' tall can be configured behind the performers to create an orchestral shell that spans a total length of 114' around the stage. In order to modify the reverberance inside the auditorium, interior walls are covered by heavy acoustical velour draperies and removable banners. The theatre uses audio equipment to amplify and adjust sound. Audio technicians utilize a front of house mixing console with 48 microphone inputs projected over an array of speakers. Performers have the option to equip headsets or microphones, controlled through a central monitor sound system.

THEATRE HISTORY
Charlottetown in Prince Edward Island is the location of the Province House where 23 Fathers of Confederation attended Conferences in 1864. These Conferences established principles of the future state now known as Canada. Newfoundland was the last province to join and entered the Canadian Confederacy in 1949 under the leadership of the last Confederate Father, Joey Smallwood. Canada as a young country was developing national designations to strengthen its values and identity. For the first time the entire country contributed to founding a center for cultural events and as a memorial for the established Confederation. Known today as the Confederate Centre of Arts, its edifice commemorates Canadian achievements and progress. The Centre directly neighbors the Province House that share walking tours all around the historic downtown. Construction began in 1960 and it is known that every Canadian citizen has contributed to the erection of this monument. During the opening, members of the British Commonwealth, including Canadian Prime minister L.B. Pearson and Queen Elizabeth II officially opened the venue to the public on 6 October 1964. It was labeled as a National Historic Site of Canada in 2003 and continues to represent Canadian unity with live cultural performances to this day. Commonly known as Homburg Theatre, its mandated to showcase the best Canadian visual and performing arts since 1965. The theatre would support all kinds of performances and events. In the building's latter epochs, performances became sound demanding and the theatre was no longer capable of enhancing quality sounds for the best experience. In 2014 there was persistence to improve the environmental quality of the theatre through aesthetics, lighting and acoustics. A renovation project that cost $12 million that enhanced the theatre's spatial quality specifically for performance arts. Professional grade materials and equipment, along with newly constructed catwalks above the audience made for the majority of the fees. Smaller changes like adding aisles and more space for comfort and accessibility. Maintenance before the renovation took more effort and time for simply replacing a light bulb 30 feet above the audience was a challenge. Catwalks have made it possible to improve the experience and allow technicians to have more flexibility during a performance. The architectural firm managed to increase the seating capacity up to 1,110 and overall space for the user to optimize comfort. LED lighting on the side walls that can also be altered by the technicians gave an ambiance of a grand theatre. The ceiling mushroom lamps have been replaced by triangular shaped clouds that were not arbitrary but specific for acoustical reasons. Seating before had good sound quality only in the front and diminished further down the rows, but now the space is arranged in a way that allows all of the audience to experience the quality of the performers. The architects have simply modernized the aesthetics and made the approach into the theatre more welcoming. All of the information and innovative materials available today have been integrated into the design and kept the theatre in light of modern theaters around the world for performance.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE

The auditorium, built of concrete construction, has three levels of seating: the Orchestra, the Front Balcony, and the Upper Balcony. In 2015, the Centre went through $12 million worth of acoustic renovation to focus primarily on a music theatre. Shifting focus to market demands required "significant redesign to optimize acoustics and accommodate larger audience capacity requirements" (BGHJ, 2015). Atop the existing balcony sits two new loggies with multiple catwalks and a new sound, lighting, and follow-spot platform (BGHJ, 2015). Acoustically engineered and triangulated wall and ceiling panels create an acoustic continuation throughout the venue. The state-of-art panel system provides optimal sound quality to further immerse the audience into a performance. The panels are intermittent throughout the walls and ceiling to mimic the rhythmic motion of sound waves (BGHJ, 2015). Behind the main stage there are three relocated Baldacchino panels which project sounds into the audience but also prevent reverberations into other sections of the complex. These new auditions accumulate to provide 21st century sound quality in a Main-stage Theatre that is over 50 years old. The highest sound quality in the theatre is located directly center left and center right of the Orchestra, where the corner panels create a near perfect acoustic projection. All sound reflections are dispersed in rhythmic layers throughout the seating chart which accommodate the realities of direct sound. Approximately half of the audience will hear both direct and reflected sound, while the other half will hear solely directed sound (see figure 2). The reflected sound is generated by the newly configured panel system that aims at surrounding an occupant with immersive acoustics. Direct sound can be

THEATRE HISTORY
The project was commissioned through a two part competition. The program called for a total gross area of 2,200m2 with a budget of six-million dollars. In addition of the given program that had to respond to the theatre typology, the brief outlined that architects had to consider urban and social issue in their design, as well as play with perceptual and experiential elements to stimulate meaning and bring significance to the user's experience. The competition began in late 2005, and the finalists were announced early 2006. The joint proposal by Paul Laurendeau and Jodoin Lamarre Pratte eventually won the competition. The judges digged the projects simplicity and spatial efficiency; as well as the focus placed on community and social integration through the transparent foyer. Additionally, their circulation space was minimal, yet managed to connect all the spaces very well together. Following their victory, they worked closely at refining the design to fix any quirks that were pointed out by the judges in the review stage. The building was set to be complete for June 2007, but actually ended in October of 2008. It received positive feedback from critics and the community it serves. In 2006 it was the recipient of the Award of Excellence by Canadian Architect. As soon as it opened, the season tickets were all purchased within 15 minutes of going on sale. Paul Laurendeau, the architect of the Dolbeau-Mistassini Theatre proclaims "architecture in one way presents a fantasy in which you can penetrate... discover some sort of volume afterwards into which you look up... this is what I tried to do in this theatre space." The architect desired to design a building that makes the user dream. Through the form's embodiment of verticality, wrapping and comfort, he gave these spaces the exceptional qualities he envisioned that made this concept a reality. The architecture firm won the competition to design the building, and with this being their first theatre, they conducted an intense research beforehand looking at ensuring quality acoustics, program and aesthetics. Other drivers of the project were to capture the essence of 19th Century Theatres and to bring people as close to the stage as possible to connect them with the performers. These notions have been very well received and the building has been claimed to be a success by its visitors and users, one could call it a grande successo .

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
The acoustics of the Dolbeau-Mistassini Theatre were appropriately designed to host multiple activities ranging from plays, musical activities and musical concert. The architect, Paul Laurendeau, wanted to capture the essence of 19th century theatres with quality acoustics. Laurendeau designed a compact theatre to bring the audience as close to the stage as possible in order to better connect them with the performers. Due the space's height, the theatre requires a sound amplification system that insures adequate acoustical volume is delivered to entire audience. Concerts with natural sound require the addition of a movable orchestra shells because the parameters of the theatre are not designed for this kind of sound source. According to the acoustical consultant the reverberation time in the room is 1 second at 500 Hz. The large, flat acoustic ceiling from where the chandelier hangs from, along with the profile of the balconies helps reduce reverberation time. The background noise level of the auditorium is NC-25 and for the foyer it is NC-40. In order to reach these noise levels, sound insulating vestibules create a noise separation between the auditorium and adjacent spaces. The architect created good acoustical conditions by reducing the distance between the source where the sound would be emitting from and the farthest seat away from the stage. The slope of the seating provides a better dispersion of direct sound within the theatre. One of the architect's acoustical strategies was to utilize different materiality has been applied to different surfaces within the theatre. The walls that are closest to the stage have hard reflecting surfaces to project the sound towards the audience. The back walls are made of fabric covered porous materials that are highly absorptive.

The porous materials are essential to reduce delayed sound reflections, sound concentrations and other acoustical defects that are found in confined spaces.

CITY: ADDRESS: ACOUSTICS CONSULTANT: ARCHITECT: OWNER: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: RESTORATION DATE: Mont-Laurier, Quebec 543 Rue du Pont SNC-Lavalin Infrastructure Group Les Architectes FABG Muni-Spec $9,200,000 (+ equipment and taxes) 2015 N/A

THEATRE HISTORY
Located in a small town within Quebec, Mont-Laurier has recently opened a Multi-functional Theatre in 2015 designed by Les Architects FABG. The site around the theatre plays an interesting role for this new and inventive building, located just south of the Lievre River and situated between a cathedral and a public school. The design that Les Architects FABG proposed was chosen for its architectural language that speaks not only to the immediate context but also to the specific region that Mont-Laurier is found in. Known for the dominant forest industry, the competition for this theater was to celebrate the types of wood found in this natural and mountainous area of Quebec, while also designing a theater that would be used by the community, cathedral and public school adjacent to the site. The dominant presence of wood creates a grand gesture as the entrance is shaded by a large overhang made of cross-laminated timber beams offering a welcoming first impression. Other materials that reinforce this friendly and open façade are a large curtain wall and steel framing allowing pedestrians to connect and visualize the programming and circulation within the interior of the building. Another successful component within the MontLaurier Multi-functional Theatre is the connection the building has with the immediate surrounding context. It provides many sights of the neighborhood and mountain views that are framed with steel, a crucial material used to create the many flexible spaces found within the main hall. The main space that has made this theatre very recognizable is known as the Hall and has been carefully designed to transform into a convention centre, concert hall, cabaret, performing arts events and most other large events. The concept of an interchangeable venue allows the community to hold any events at the Multi-functional Theatre and creates a central gathering space within the neighborhood. Depending of the specific layout or function, this Hall can hold from 270 to 700 seats as it is composed of 3 main seating sections. With new technology the space can take from 50 minutes to 4 hours to transform the layout of the event space. Splitting the seating into 3 sections creates flexibility for the Hall and allows more or less fixed seats. The first section closest to the stage is held up on a platform with synchronized spiralifts that lower under the floor and glide on rails to be tucked away. The middle seating section has telescopic seats that are able to retract down below the floor like those on the spiralifts. The rear or third seating section is on a permanent mezzanine that holds 184 seats and provides seating for each layout of the room. Despite the amazing design and complex room configuration, major budget cuts were made on lighting, compromising the overall quality of space. The same stage lighting used for art performances are being used for large social events such as trade shows and banquets which offer strong beams of light unlike the soft and diffused lighting needed for other types of functions. Other than the cutbacks on lighting this theater has had no other complaints and has been running smoothly. Since the grand opening in late 2015, Les Architectes FABG have been praised by the 13,000 residents of Mont-Laurier and many architects around the world for the design of this unique and flexible event space. The form and materiality of this building relates to the context and history of this small town making a smooth transition into the neighborhood.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
Les architectes FABG created the ideal acoustical profile through structural concepts and strategic designs. They improved the main multi-functional space by utilizing various acoustic elements, such as diffusers, absorbents, and reflectors. The architects enhanced the room by intensifying the sound with hardwood surfaces, filtering the sound with grid framed structures, and absorbing the sound with dense fabrics. Their enhanced multi-sound design approach enriches the space, creating a successful concert hall for countless performances. The first acoustic element that was used in this space are diffusers. This method is used to disperse sound in all directions while removing detrimental echoes. This ensures every seat within the space experiences the same sound quality throughout the entire performance. The Mont-Laurier theatre contains various diffuser panels located on both sidewalls of the hall. These panels are separated by hardwood surfaces in a continuous pattern extending the full height of the space. The diffusers are constructed in a rectangular grid system with a greater width dimension compared to depth. The width and quantity of slots determine the overall quality of diffusion, as well as enhance the spaciousness and reverberance in the space. The second acoustic element used in this space are absorbents. This method is used to absorb the sound removing detrimental reflections that effect the quality of the room. Absorbent materials have a soft surface and are considerately light weight, however, the thicker the material the greater absorbent ability it has. The concert hall utilizes the audience and seating as well as draped curtains behind the stage to consume additional disruptions during the performance. Les architectes FABG decided to use minimal absorbent material in the space to avoid the removal of valuable sound. The third acoustic element used to enhance the space are reflectors. This method is used to reflect the sound throughout the room; intensifying the audiences' experience. The reflection of sound occurs off a hard surface and is directed into the audience. The Mont-Laurier hall is finished with hardwood surfaces reflecting sound throughout the space strengthening the quality of the performance. Other additional acoustic design strategies used to enhance the space are isolation, and semi-enclosed seating that frame the hall. The room is designed to limit the amount of wall and ceiling penetrations to prevent sound from escaping the space. Dense materials for

doors and tight seals also are design strategies used to avoid the loss of sound within the concert hall. Semienclosed seating is located at the back of the room, which reflects the sound back into the space improving the nature of the room.

BOURGIE CONCERT HALL
CITY: ADDRESS: ACOUSTICS CONSULTANT: ARCHITECT: OWNER: CONSTRUCTION COST: COMPLETION DATE: RESTORATION DATE: Montréal, Quebec 1339 Sherbrooke Street West Legault & Davidson Provencher Roy + Associés Architects Montreal Museum of Fine Arts $20,000,000 2011 N/A

THEATRE HISTORY
The Bourgie Concert Hall is located at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts; also known as the MMFA in the Golden Square Mile of Montreal. It is part of a restoration project completed in 1894 in the Neo-Romanesque style. The Museum originally inhabited the Erskine and American heritage church. This was constructed in 1894 which is now transformed and equipped with stunning historical Louis Comfort Tiffany stained glass windows and beautiful decor. To revisit, the Art Association of Montreal was developed to showcase Montreal's fine arts among the city in 1860. Unfortunately, there was no location for safe storage of the artifacts and art which forced them to disclose the work in various venues around Montreal. Later on, Benaiah Gibb gave the foundation a gift of a gallery space which engaged a strong interest in the public, causing donations to multiply to accommodate for a museum. As they started to expand, the site became too small. Consequently, the Museum moved to the Golden Square, giving them even more attractions and attention. On September 4, 1972, the museum was a victim of the largest heist in Canadian history which caused a loss, worth a total of $2 million at the time. The museum is currently split up into three major pavilions consisting of a Beaux Arts (Michal and Renata Hornstein Pavilion), the modernist Jean-Noël Desmarais Pavilion across the street and the Liliane and David M. Stewart Pavilion. When the church got added to the venue, it stood as a separate dwelling, which was designated a national historic site of Canada in 1998 due to many of its Romanesque architectural elements designed by American Architect Henry Richardson. It was designed to reflect the new values and program of the United Church of Architect Percy Nobbs. The museum along with the church brought a strong architectural culture aspect to the community. One of the main features included the Tiffany windows which allowed diffused light to come in while maintaining the stain glass. The Tiffany windows were restored over a long period of time which added to the high quality acoustics in the hall. The church was renovated to become a setting for performances for chamber music ensembles and orchestras. Bourgie Hall is a 2011 excellence award winner, showcasing it's exceptional transformation from a church to a concert hall. In addition, the Urban Development Institute of Quebec commended the new pavilion for its integration of a historical building and a modern fusion of design. The concert hall seats 444 people, with a balcony above. Almost 100 concerts are hosted every year where crowds come to listen primarily to classical and contemporary chamber music. The performances reflect the overall museum's activities as well as more external features such as Montreal's music, art and cultural scenes. The approximately twenty Tiffany stained glass windows are one of the most famous collections in the world. They are installed in the interior chapel and they are renowned for their special lighting effects, naturalist lamps and shading devices, with metal filigree knitted with precious colored glass. They are differentiated widely by their translucency compared to more frequently found European glass. Overall, with the historic interior preserved, the Bourgie Hall is a unique setting to experience a concert. Both the museum and city benefited through the adaptive reuse process, creating a standard for historic churches of Montreal.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
Bourgie Hall is made up of a curved interior within a rectangular floor plan. The stage (87.56 m2) is semi-curved and supported by walls in a semi-circular path that start from backstage and continue towards the audience seating. The walls form a circle with radius of about 15m. These walls gives a large contribution to the excellent acoustic quality of the room. The curved aspect projects sound from the stage into the audience, increasing loudness and clarity from all seating locations. The curves allow indirect sound waves to travel and reflect off of the farther back in the concert hall. This helps with the issue of bringing sound to audience in the back due to the flat seating arrangement of the theater. Assuming due to the existing conditions per-renovation, the seating could not have been arranged in tier style which is the preferred choice for concert and performance spaces. However, the Romanesque qualities of the historic church (the curvature of plan and walls) make up for this challenge. This allowed for seating to be arranged in a circular organization. This arrangement gives audience members a better advantage of view and sound then a typical rectangular arrangement. Since direct sound travels forward, audience members on the sides of the hall can face the stage and hear the sound. On the upper floor of the hall, a balcony is featured in a uneven curving shape. The circular plan of the hall must have been the driver for this design decision. Generally, room shapes containing perfect circles does not output acoustical sounds effectively. Sounds from a source usually reflects off the surface walls onto a concentrated focal point. This results flutter echoes, producing extra noise to audience members. To avoid this, it is best to design with irregular, unequal planes to diffuse sound throughout the room rather than in one concentrated point. The waving shape of the balcony is circular in the center but even out into an irregular curve. This prevents sounds from reflecting back to the audience. Another method Provencher Roy + Associés Architects implemented to improve sound quality in the hall was a hanging reflector above the stage. The reflector is used to enhance sound quality and loudness in the hall. It is designed to capture indirect sound from the stage and reflect it off the ceiling into the further seating areas. In terms of acoustic flaws, Bourgie Hall is respected for working around the challenges of the existing conditions of the church. The original architecture featured several arches and a large dome in the center. Domes are traditionally not elements that would support a concert or performance hall. The reverberation time achieved within this kind of space would be much higher than preferred for a concert/musical setting. The dome works for cathedrals and churches because of the softer acoustics and echoes that fit the setting. A design solution to this challenge was to use the reflector to avoid any direct sound transmitting to the dome resulting in echoing noise. However, this solution probably also limited the distance the reflector can cover. For example, looking at floor plans and photographs of the hall, the ceiling reflector appears to be smaller than its potential. Many concert halls of similar size are designed with longer, larger, and even multiple reflectors that cover both the stage and audience. However, the single reflector at Bourgie Hall hangs only over the stage. Although it does do its job for reflecting and diffusing sound, it could have done it more effectively. Bourgie Hall is well respected because of its transformation to a concert hall from a church. Due to this, it is an excellent example to look at the challenges of theater design and how solutions are resolved. Acoustically, the concert hall could have been improved if it was a new construction building but overall Provencher and Roy succeeded in this challenging project.

LA MAISON SYMPHONIQUE DE MONTRÉAL
CITY: Montréal, Québec ADDRESS: 1600 Saint Urbain Street ACOUSTICS CONSULTANT: Artec Consultants ARCHITECT: Diamond Schmitt Architects OWNER: Quebec Ministry of Culture, Communications and the Status of Women CONSTRUCTION COST: $134,500,000 COMPLETION DATE: September 7, 2011

THEATRE HISTORY
Maison Symphonique de Montreal is the new home of the Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal. It was opened in September 2011, located within the Place des Arts Complex in the heart of downtown Montreal. The stage can accommodate up to 120 musicians and choir up to 200 voices. Today, the Maison Symphonique de Montreal host ensembles such as the Orchestre Metropolitain, I Musici de Montreal, chamber orchestras Les Violons du Roy, concerts and recitals by Pro Musica Society and many other International Musical Competition. For many years, the Montreal Symphony Orchestra's home was nearby Salle Wilfrid Pelletier, a 2,990 seat auditorium for rock bands and comedy acts. The practice schedule for the orchestra became difficult to plan due to the harsh acoustics next door. Therefore, the orchestra decided to build a new performance venue near the site, solely for music, classical performance and future possible concerts for international performers. Finally the design competition was held in 2002. When the bids were made in 2009, Groupe Immobilier Ovation owned by SNC- Lavalin underbid and won the contract to construct the new concert hall, with Diamond and Schmitt and AEdifica collaborating the architecture and design. Maison Symphonique de Montreal was the first public private partnership (P3) cultural project in Quebec and North America. The government of Quebec hired Artec, a New York acoustic and theatre design firm to help with the design parameters and acoustic requirements for the concert hall. The design requirements and detail drawings were documented and later passed onto the architecture design team. The entire project was designed and detailed with the construction starting within less than 30 months. The concert hall was designed to be an integral part of Place des Art, the center culture district of downtown Montreal. The building was positioned towards the east to create a connection with the street, the four storey lobby is glazed and visible in order to build a relationship with the street and the public city life. Canadian beach wood was chosen to be the primary material for the interior cladding, which provides

warmth, intimacy and performance experience with great acoustics for both musicians and the audience. Since the chosen site of the new concert hall is near by the subway lines, the vibrations produced by this infrastructure could have permeated through the concert hall structure. Therefore, in order to meet the requirements of the soundproofing and acoustic quality, the 2,000 seat auditorium was separated from the adjacent structure both horizontally and vertically. Like a shoe box, the auditorium is structurally separated from everything outside and below. The building envelope is made by three layers of thick masonry wall to prevent external noise. And more than 175 rubber pads were used between steel plates to avoid vibrations from the lower support structure and adjacent underground parking lot. Overall, the Maison Symphonique de Montreal is a good example for music concert halls in comparison to many of the great halls around the world. It became one of the city's cultural inspirations and important segment of the Place des Arts Complex. Moreover, Maison Symphonique is a call for profession to engage in greater system design in procurement and building production.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE

The hall is cited to be "comparable to the best halls in the world in terms of acoustics". The hall integrates existing technologies and transforms them into a superior acoustical experience. Kent Nagano, music director of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, describes the building as "the fulfillment of a dream that the orchestra has been waiting for The hall satisfies an ambient noise level of N-1, which specifies an through its 77-year history". environment where the background noise level cannot be audibly perceived by the audience member.

These strategies achieved kilograms, span across the orchestra and audience area noise minimization that is especially important in halls for (photo 5). The motorized panels reflect sound energy to unamplified performances to maximize the quality, clarity, and the stage and across the audience, as well as control the strength of music. acoustic coupling of the space below and above. The level of resonance inside the hall can be extended by the partially coupled chamber above the ceiling with coordinated dimensions, materials, and openings. Motorized sound absorbing curtains surround the room, which serve to control the reverberation time for different types of music. Additionally, the size of the stage can be modified according to the number of performers, with a maximum capacity of 120 artists. The form of the hall mimics that of a "shoebox", characterized by a long, narrow, tall, and straight geometry. This is contrasted by the curvilinear and non-uniform formal language of the interior, which serves acoustical purposes. The number of reflective surfaces is maximized through the undulating walls and convex balcony facades around the room (photo 6). The reflection of a wide range of frequencies is achieved by these different forms at different scales (photo 7). For example, some wood panels were finished with a fine sandpaper texture which slightly softens high frequency sounds, and generates different reflections and refractions than the curved walls of a larger scale. In addition, audience seats are arranged in gentle arcs across the floor, while balcony levels surround the perimeter of the walls. Every seat has a clear sight line to the stage, which is necessary for good acoustics. These features produced an intimate relationship between the performers and the audience, ensuring the same level of sound quality for every member of the audience, experienced from every vintage point across the hall. One feels enveloped entirely by the sound of music inside the space.

The interior is clad mainly of Québec beech wood. Aside from aesthetic considerations, the material serves acoustical purposes, reflecting sound with a level of aural precision. Audience seats are made with dense foam to limit sound absorption so as to not deaden the music (photo 8). During practice, curtain is used to simulate the presence of audience.

THEATRE HISTORY
The Rialto Theatre is a National Historic Site of Canada that received its designation in 1993. The architectural work of Raoul Gariépy on Rialto Theatre's façade and interior resulted in the buildings unique position in theatre design. Rialto theatre achieved its designation because of its position in Canada's historical theatre architecture. The construction of the first theatre started in 1923 and completed in 1924. The theatre was fully operation as a performance hall until 1990, desperately needing a restoration. The theatre was functionless until 2010, where a new owner took on the restoration process and brought the theatre back to life. The interior design of the performance hall was designed by Emmanuel Briffa, which designed many theatre interiors in a Louis XVI style. The interior design resembled a Paris Opera with a Neo-Baroque style followed by a monumental columned façade of the Beaux-Arts style on the exterior. The exterior façade of the Rialto Theatre expresses the beauty of the Beaux-Arts principles with its monumentality, symmetry, smooth surfaces and rational ordered planning. (Parks Canada, n.d.). The interior plan allowed for variety of functions, such as multifunctional rooms that can be turned into dance halls, skittles, billard rooms or roof gardens. It was the first theatre in Montreal to place the circulation axis parallel to the façade. (Parks Canada, n.d.) The interior décor, Beaux-Arts aesthetic, the steep pitch of the balcony and use of theatre boxes set the Rialto Theatre apart from the other theatre designs of its time. The architect, Raoul Gariépy was specialized in theatre projects and worked on the architectural and acoustic design on his lonesome. Raoul had designed five other theatre in Montreal before taking on the Rialto Theatre. The engineering firm responsible for the concrete structure used for the building was Forgues and Guay. The interior decoration by Emmanuel Briffa featured rich Baroque inspired paintings, mouldings, plaster reliefs and illuminated panels. The restoration of the Rialto Theatre carefully restored Briffa's interior detailing back to its original state. While also improving the seating in the theatre with multiple configurations for such as cabaret style seating, row seating or standing mode depending on the occupancy demand.

The acoustics in the theatre were improved in the restoration with a redesigned sound systems by Drew Malamud and Laurent Magne for the performance hall. The shape and design of the theatre however was not altered as the restoration focused on bringing the theatre back to its original state and the acoustics did not require improvement.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
Rialto Theatre has a stage around 35 by 30 feet (10.6x9.1m) with a height of 50 feet (15.2m). The overall room dimensions are 100 by 60 feet (30.4x18.2m) including the stage. The shape of the hall is rectangular with a rather narrow and deep seating design, which results in a long travel distance for the sound. The main floor minimal slope towards the stage in contrast to the large steep slope of the balcony floor. The stage features a sloped ceiling that helps reflect the sound down to the balcony seating. However, because of the balcony being placed directly over the main floor seating the sound is not able to be reflected into that space. Instead, the main floor only receives direct sound and no reflected sound. The ceiling of the theatre features and artificially light glass "skylight" in the center that helps diffuse and reflect the sound deep into the balcony seating. The overall materiality of the theatre walls and ceilings is wood and pilaster over a concrete and brick structure. The hall is heavily detailed with moulded plaster panels and custom wood working along the walls and ceilings help scatter the sound in the hall. The materiality of theatre absorbs much of the sound as the theatre relies heavily on the sound systems to reproduce the sound. The sound system used in the theatre was greatly improved with Adamson systems that where designed by Drew Malamud and Laurent Magne. The sound systems features a long list of technical sound equipment designed to provide the best sound performance for various styles of performers and events such as concerts, film screenings, dances and theatrical performances. The theatre contains two levels, the main floor and the large balcony hovering on top. Originally, the theatre capacity was 1330 with 630 seats on the balcony and 700 on the main floor. However, after the restoration the balcony now seats 450 people with the new Afra Furniture theatre seats. The main floor has several configurations to support occupants. In standing configuration the main floor can support up to 708 people, with the theatre row seating configuration the capacity is 450 people. With the cabaret style configuration the seating capacity is limited to 350 people, resulting with an overall seating capacity of 1,158-800 people.

The Salle Wilfrid Pelletier is the largest performance hall in Québec with a proscenium stage. Over the years, it has only undergone one renovation in 1993, where 78 seats were removed in order to accommodate for 70 musicians. It now features a capacity of 2996 people and an adjustable pit that can hold up to 100 musicians. Using a technique of multiple levels of seating, the space is able to remain quite intimate with an orchestra, corbeille, mezzanine, balcony and box seats.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
The design of the the Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier hall was an experimental architecture for acoustical design for a multi-functional hall. To minimize the distance that the sound has to travel, the multi-story balconies are present to allow many people to receive the acoustical performance. Although designed in the 1960's, the design of the hall has relatively good acoustical designs thanks to the fan shape of the hall. The fan-shaped Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier theatre, which is the largest multi-purpose theatre in Canada, has a honeycombed ceiling allowing for the sound to travel throughout the hall. It does not sell itself short when it comes to catering to the different acoustical needs of each performance type it was built to host, which ranges from orchestras and operas to theatrical productions. The concerts are possible due to the built-in sound system that amplifies the overall acoustical performance through multiple speakers placed around the hall. Although the sound system may be used for concerts, they are commonly used for non-orchestral events, which are serviced by Chadi Kaahwaji of the Trizart Alliance; a multimedia audiovisual designer and theatre consultation company. Based on audience experiences, including those that have had the "nose bleed seats" (which are the highest and the furthest seats away from the stage), are able to hear and see clearly. However, great things comes with flaws, which have been identified by acoustical professionals. These criticisms include that of the orchestra or ground level not having sufficient loudness Studies from acoustical consultants comment that the ceiling of the shell is too high and the rear wall is too wide, which diminishes the sound that has to travel throughout the far ends of the space. Concerns were made that too much sound is being trapped on the stage and the lack of music clarity. A second analyst stated that there are no surfaces at or near the sides of the procenium to reflect the lateral sound energy onto the orchestra level. This laterally reflected sound energy would give the audience the feeling of intimacy and of being enveloped by the sound. Not only were the walls criticized, but the open ceiling does not reflect enough sound energy to the main floor, due to its porosity. One acoustician reports of an experiment, where it shows that when the back wall of the orchestra enclosure is brought forward, causing the front half of the orchestra to sit over the pit, the music sounds louder, fuller and more intimate on the main floor. This experiment illustrates that the acoustics could be improved even further with additional reflecting surfaces on either side of the pit location and if a proper shape

were located in the space below or above the ceiling. This would increase the loudness of the orchestral sound to the audience areas, as well as enveloping the listeners with sound, creating a more intimate atmosphere. The changes to the hall will not only improve the acoustical performances to the audience, but to the musicians as well. The artists would also be able to sense the better acoustics of the hall. On a final note, the experts suggest that if modifications to the lower side walls and the doors were made, lateral reflections could be increased further and thus add to the feeling of spaciousness. From a different perspective, an artistic director, Kent Nagano, states, "we're getting used to playing in a hall where we can really play the extreme range of the dynamics." He describes that in the Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier hall, the large seating capacity, the generic acoustics, and the very loud air-conditioning unit make it impossible to play piano. It meant that playing piano would be at least playing mezzo-piano and sometimes even mezzoforte, which are dependent upon how loud the air-conditioning is.Kent Nagano also explains that playing too aggressively could have a negative effect as it could completely change the aesthetics of the acoustics flowing into the hall. he is fearful that the acoustics could end up sounding very two-dimensional--very hard and very brittle. Overall, the acoustics of the Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier hall is excellently designed for its time period and for its performance type versatility with its acoustics considered, including its flaws and benefits. The flaws can be disguised with modifications, if necessary, which makes this old hall a great one.

The Schulich school of Music of McGill university is one of canada's largest professional based educational and training facility for the art of music. in 1884, the Music program began and was only serviced for women until 1904. as the population of student continued to increase over the years, the school was in dire need of more faculty space and plans for expansion began in the late 1980s. The Strathcona Music Building eventually became largely insufficient for the students and potential plans were developed by 1994. in 1995, the school's faculty of music reached out to the Quebec Ministry of education for financial aid and was provided roughly $1 million to launch preliminary design drawings. construction commenced in 2003 and was completed by 2005, opening on September 30th at the construction cost of approximately $70 million. Fortunately, a $20 million donation was received from the graduate student, Seymour Schulich, which allowed for the construction of The elizabeth Wirth Music Building ­ the current house of the Tanna Schulich hall, which was named in honor of the famous violinist and wife of Seymour. located directly adjacent to the now historical Strathcona Building ­ the first music building for the school ­ the building houses a library, recital hall, faculty offices, and an all-inclusive, state of the art, multimedia /practice music studios over the span of 8 floors. of the many prized additions to the faculty of music, the Tanna Schulich hall stands at the top, earning a title as one of Montreal's busiest and best concert venues to this day. The hall was designed by architects Menkes, Shooner, Degenais, le Tourneux, and Saucier & Perrotte with the acoustic helps of arTec consultants to design the sound proofing stage, hall and recording studios. although the hall isn't too large in scale compared to that of the Pollack hall ­ which continues to be the largest performance venue in the school containing 600 seats ­ it features a total of 188 seats (182 with tables), and still functions as a successful lecture and recital hall for students and anyone who rents out the space. The building and Tanna Schulich hall is overall a very young venue that has many more prosperous years ahead of it and seems to be successfully giving back to the students of McGill university, as well as to the people of Montreal.

The Tanna Shulich hall is designed for small presentations and performances that range from chamber music, jazz and contemporary music ensembles as well as lectures. as one of the busiest concert halls of McGill, the Tanna Schulich hall has been designed in the typical shoe box form with a double height interior space accessible from both the first and second storeys. The music hall is known for its intimacy and small reverberation time of approximately 0.79 seconds (figure 1) which results in a Schroder frequency of only 47 hz. Furthermore, its location within the building not only allows appropriate access to the lobby of the Schulich School of Music but also supports its outstanding performance. The hall has been designed by the sound engineering consultants: artec. consequently, they have purposefully located the concert hall on the ground floor and in the middle of the building in order to isolate it from exterior sounds or vibrations. The room is made of dense acoustical walls covered with absorptive wooden paneling from approximately a meter above the floor all the way to the ceiling. The paneling was molded with vertical slits and an interior air cavity consequently allowing the panels to act as acoustic helmotz resonators which diffuse the sound coming from the hall. This increases the overall performance of the already absorptive wall system in place and the acoustic fabric around the stage. additionally, in order to achieve such high acoustical standards of the hall, suspended acoustic reflector panels have been arrayed on a grid pattern along the ceiling. This sound paneling system has been suspended on a light steel structure with an air cavity just above the panels acting as a drop-down ceiling. each panel is positioned at slightly different angles in order to scatter any sound waves reflecting from their surface back into the concert hall. The sound system installed in the hall is a 5 channel loudspeaker system. The front loudspeakers are calibrated and directed in order to produce an off axis frequency response. Due to the rectangular shape of the room, the sound system has been positioned in a different way than the recommended for its azimuthal angles: the loudspeakers have been elevated and placed at roughly 150° with an arc of ca. 8.2 m, measured from the clP speakers. (Peter, 2010) This placement allows to reduce the effect of the surround loudspeaker due to displacement.

THÉÂTRE DE QUAT'SOUS

THEATRE HISTORY
The Theatre de Quat'Sous, also known as the Threepenny Theatre in English, was completed in April of 2009. Theatre de Quat'Sous stands as one of the three oldest theatrical establishments in Montreal. Founded in 1955 by Paul Bussonneau, the Theatre de Quat'Sous began as a nonprofit organization and established its own home in an old synagogue that was converted to sit 160 people. Theatre de Quat'Sous was located in an old converted synagogue since 1965 and went under extensive construction in 1985. This new condition only lasted just over 10 years until the theatre experienced a fire in 1998 that destroyed the archives and parts of the synagogue. Despite the fire, the stage and part of the theatre still remained and was continued to be used by the theatre group. Complaints started to emerge in 2003 from users of the theatre regarding security, comfort, additional production oriented spaces, and in general better facilities. The complaints would then help push for a better facility for both performers and it's viewers which now presently stands on the corner of Avenue des Pins Est and Avenue Coloniale as the new Theatre de Quat'Sous. The theatre has been seen as a cultural landmark as it has contributed immensely in helping form and shaping Montreal's theatre culture and drama for the past 50 years. Although the theatre could be considered small for its size, it can be seen as a creative and professional platform for numerous Quebec actors, performers, and playwrights such as Jean Morin, Robert Gurik, Marie Savard, and Serge Sirois. From the theatre's beginning and founding, the company and various directors committed in providing the public of Montreal innovative and experimental productions. The theatre has been known for displaying productions that were in a way provocative and innovative that often questioned dominant social values. The focus of the theatre is now much larger, aiming to cover numerous international plays. The new theatre is located on a site that was previously occupied by three row houses. FABG Architects deemed it impossible to renovate the current deteriorating wood and brick structure of the three row houses all whilst trying to meeting the client's requests. In terms of size, the new theatre in comparison to the old converted synagogue is not much larger as the present one only has a maximum capacity of 170 seats despite having additional balcony seating. During the construction of the Theatre, through client request, the architects incorporated as many materials from the original building as a way to pay homage to the old Theatre de Quat'Sous. Textures, images, and colours were sampled from the original building and used for the assemblage of the required volumes: stage, house, foyer, crossover, control booth and rehearsal. These materials, in combination with new present materials, helped evoke memories of the old theatre while at the same time providing a good and pleasant acoustical space. From the exterior, the building reads horizontally as three distinct volumes: the stage, the auditorium, and vertical circulation. These volumes are then articulated through the use of specific materials that help differentiate and emphasize the character of each volume. Similarly when read vertically, the same effect is achieved. The foyer and administration located on the ground floor, the stage and auditorium with glazed circulation located in the middle, and the rehearsal hall and terrace on the top. Each volume is materialized to achieve the same effect of distinction as previously mentioned. The architects objective was to create a defined sense of intimacy, that helped pay homage and evocative of the former theatre that users new and old may be able to still experience.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
The theatre is quite small, accommodating only 170 occupants at maximum capacity. This small design was in part a response to the site area, but was also a desire of FABG architects with the aim of defining a space of acoustic comfort and intimacy. The space is primarily used for theatrical productions, which are typically vocally focused, with the aid of a booth controlled, mounted speaker system. The small space caters well to this application; the seating, even at the balcony level remains close to the stage, which offers a greatly reduced traveling distance for sound waves emitted by on-stage activity. Sound equipment is conveniently located close to each section of seating, and can therefore be adjusted to level that are optimal for the closest section of seating in the speaker's vicinity. The space is nearly square in its area, which is advantageous in providing the space with diffuse, and even sound. Another advantage of the small space is its volume. At approximately 713 m3, the space offers significantly reduced reverberation levels. The small, rectangular volume minimizes the ratio between volume/seat ratio, which is optimal for the enjoyment of vocal theatre as the space offers little-no echo. Any late sound transmission and excess reverberation is dealt with through a number of formats; Helmholtz resonator paneling is placed on either side of the seating at the stage level, which aids in absorbing the med-high frequency sound waves emitted in the vocal spectrum (fig. 4). Additionally, vibrating panel absorbers are placed along the remainder of the wall surfaces to provide ample sound absorbing material for the lower end of vocal frequency (fig. 5). Any reverberant sound that remains in the space is absorbed by velvet seating upholstery and heavy carpet (fig. 6&7). The porosity of the combined materials aids in further diffusing and dissipating excess reverberant sound. Due to the small dimension of the overhanging balcony, the space does not experience the scattering effect of sound diffusion, which in turn keeps the sound below the balcony level quite consistent with the open areas of seating. This ensures that the space continually provides a pleasant listening experience regardless of the occupant's seated position.

THEATRE HISTORY
The La Manufacture Theatre Company was founded 41 years ago in 1975 and performed within the La Licorne Theatre and restaurant space 36 years ago. Within the fi rst years of the La Manufacture Theatre Company's existence, the theatre attracted young actors and actresses to perform skits as well as foreign dramas. La Manufacture became more prominent and with a lack of performing venues in the city of Montreal at the time, La Manufacture needed permanent space to perform. In 1981, La Manufacture began to perform their company's theatrical pieces at the La Licorne theatre/ dinner venue. La Licorne translated in English, means "The Unicorn". This specifi c dinner venue also allowed other local theatre company's to perform at the venue. The La Licorne Theatre, once located on one of Montréal's main streets, Boulevard St. Laurent, became an icon of the urban theatre scene and with this growth in popularity, the company needed a larger venue space. In 1989, La Licorne Theatre moved to another facility on Avenue Papineau. Although the company moved to a larger facility, the building still carried out the company's reputation as a place that allows for creativity in the dramatic performing arts in an intimate setting. This has always been an objective of La Licorne to preserve. With younger and smaller groups of actors/actrices becoming a large role in the urban theatre scene of Montréal, La Licorne wanted to cater to this growing trend. As larger venues like La Licorne were too costly for these younger small groups, in 1995, La Licorne opened a small, intimate room for these small groups called La Petite Licorne. This small space allowed these smaller groups to experiment their creativity in the dramatic arts. For several years, La Manufacture played a signifi cant role in the success and popularity of the La Licorne Theatre. Due to this tremendous success, La Manufacture began to showcase it's dramas around Québec and to an extent, other parts of Canada. In 1997, La Manufacture entered into an offi cial partnership and sponsorship with the La Licorne Theatre company. La Licorne became the headquarters of La Manufacture's theatrical productions. This partnership brought even more success to La Manufacture and La Licorne. The success meant that the space within the facility of La Licorne was becoming far too limited for the capacity of performances. In 2002, La Licorne decided to renovate the building by adding 2 larger rooms to accommodate the increase in demand. However, in 2009, the company faced this problem once again as the La Licorne Theatre became a staple of Montréal and Québec's performing arts. This lead the management of the company to make a bold decision of demolishing the current building and building a larger and more modern facility to support the recent increase in demand and to also support future demand. From the years 2009-2011, La Licorne constructed the current facility it is housed in. They wanted a more spacious and modern layout for the theatre and achieved this new facility with much success. From 2011-2012, La Licorne began its first performing season in its new facility designed by FABG Architects.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
The Théâtre La Licorne by FABG Architects in Montreal uses the simplicity of form and the use of glass, metal, concrete, and brick in their raw forms to plays with the idea of the "manufacture". Part of La Manufacture's brief to FABG Architects was to communicate that heritage, along with its connection to the city and its inhabitants through the architecture. Elements were borrowed from industrial past, with concrete floors and cable trays that are intertwined with the structure, ventilation ducts and plumbing which further reinforces the idea of machine and manufacture. The project combined two black box theaters, La Grande and La Petite Licorne, and a rehearsal room and organized them around a unifying hall. la Petite Licorne seats up to 114 persons while la Grande Licorne can accommodate 227 people. The design of the Théâtre La Licorne was greatly impacted by the size restricting the layout of La Grande and La Petite Licorne. One of the greatest challenges was to deal with acoustic and was one of the reasons why La Licorne needed to build a new theatre is due to the fact that the old theatre was an older building that had serious acoustic problems. Éric Gauthier was once working in La Licorne and noticed sounds were transmitting from next door. The solution he came up was to layout the two black box theatres without common walls around them for reverberation purposes. Part of the acoustical design of the space is attributed to the mechanical and acoustical consultants that the architect worked with, to achieve the architect's strategy of boxing in the theatre spaces. The heavy curtains and sound absorbing panels along the walls and on the ceiling were to control the reverberations when the amplifi cation is used. The fi nishes applied to the room design were specifi cally detailed for the compact space and optimum sound quality for different purposes. All of the materials utilized help to decrease the reverberation time of sound, improving the quality and clarity of sound within the theatre.

THEATRE HISTORY
Quartier des spectacles located in the heart of Montreal, is the home of various performance halls, art galleries and cultural centres. Through the centuries this area has shaped the entertainment and cultural aspect of the city. Montreal's most important performance art centres and Canada's biggest multidisciplinary arts complex sits in this area, the Place des Arts. Initially composed of a large hall and two theatres -The Salle Wilfrid-pelletier, The Theatre Maisonneuve and The Cinquième salle - it has been continuously growing ever since. The complex comprises of six halls in total. The Quartier des Spectacles has always been a popular artistic and cultural hub in Montreal. In the 1800's, important teaching institutions such as the Bibliothèque Saint-Sulpice and the neighborhood's first cultural building, the Gesù theatre, emerged. This triggered the construction of many other theatres and cultural buildings such as the Francophone Professional Theatre and the Gayety Theatre. During the period of 1920-1960 this area was populated with an impressive number of cabarets and theatres which promoted Montreal as an entertainment and fun-loving city. The American Prohibition era helped promote the popularity of the city across North America. However, along with popularity there was a growth of crime, prostitution and illegal gaming houses, which led to the naming of such as the "red light district". By the 1950's -1960s and under the period of Jean Drapeau, mayor of Montreal, citizens conferred and created the Sir George-Étienne Cartier organization that later became the Place Des Arts (PDA) organization. This organization would deal with arts, entertainment and enhancement of cultural assets of the city. The first hall erected from the PDA was the Grande Salle theatre, inaugurated in 1963. The second and third theatre were inaugurated in 1967, Maisonneuve Théâtre and Théâtre Jean-Duceppe Place Des Arts. The Cinquieme salle was inaugurated in 1990. And the latest addition was made in 2011 with the Maison Symphonique. This complex is connected through the popular underground city, or a pedestrian network path that connects exterior areas with shopping malls, condominiums, museums, universities and metro stations. The Theatre Maisonneuve was inaugurated in 1967, after a hastened construction as the city was getting ready to host the 1967 international and universal Exposition (Expo 67). These few years in Montreal led to an iconic period of architectural modernization. Realization of this building is commonly attributed to Expo 67. It was designed by the architects David, Barott and Boulva. The theatre occupies the upper part of the building while the Jean-Duceppe occupies the lower part. Its acoustical design is primarily for dance, plays, musicals or soloist concerts, as it has a proscenium stage- explained further bellow. The performing area is at one end of the auditorium measuring 46 by 21 meters. The orchestra level or the pit holds around 45 instrumentalist.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
Theatre Maisonneuve, designed by architects `David, Barott, and Boulva', was to take on a contemporary version a classical Italian theatre, through similar characteristics that emphasize the acoustical features of the space. The configuration of the theatre optimizes the experience in which the clarity of sound is to be obtained equally from the audience. This is done through a shallow arch, resulting in the short distance between the back row and the stage; the amount of rows is reduced and the number of seats per row is maximized, which also removes typical aisles in between the seating. Multiple tiers of seating also achieve the short distance between a seat and the stage. The outcome of this configuration is the shorter time in which the sound is to be received, almost giving an equal distribution of sound to the audience. In terms of reverberation, the absorption surface is maximized to reduce the reflectivity of the sound and the low reverberation time. This is done through multiple techniques: the large number of seats increases the surface area of the plush seating material, and the rows of fabric that weave through the top of the space would also allow for the absorption of sound. This can prevent the sound from reflecting off technical equipment, structure, structure, or deep carvings of the space that may be located above the fabric. The inevitability of sound reflecting appears to also be considered in the design of the theatre, where the multiple tiers create carved out openings within the space and the sound becomes diffused once it exits these concave spaces. To achieve some transferability of sound, the material of the paneled walls on the walls adjacent of the stage, which are angled towards the audience accomplish this. Though the focus of reducing the reverberation time of the house was prime for the equality and clarity of sound, the stage behind the curtain will have a greater reverberation time because the sound is being continuously being transferred from reflective surfaces such as the great amount of technical equipment and the fact that the large volume behind the curtain is a generally empty space.

THEATRE HISTORY
Situated in the heart of historic Quebec City, just steps away from the Provincial Parliament Buildings, the Grand Théâtre de Québec stands proudly as a beacon of French Canadian arts and culture. Located just a short walk away fromthebanks oftheSt.LawrenceRiver,theGrandThéâtre maybebetter describedasanartscomplex,asitconsistsofnot just one theatre but rather two: the larger Salle Louis-Fréchette,which canaccommodateupto1875guests;andthesmallerSalle Octave-Crémazie,whichcanaccommodateup to 506 guests. The larger theatre was named after the prolific FrenchCanadian writer, Louis-Honoré Fréchette who was well known for his contributions to 19th century French-Canadian literature.Thesmallertheatrewasnamedin honor of Octave Crémazie, a poet also from the 19th century who is known by some as "the father of French-Canadian poetry". The Grand Théâtre has also been the home of the Conservatoire de musique du Québecsince October1972. Additionally, the complex houses several classrooms, workshopsandstudios,aswellasseveralrehearsalspacesfor performers. The project was first envisioned in 1963 by the Premier of Quebec, Jean Lesage who wished to commemorate Canada's upcoming centennial in 1967 with a monument in QuebecCity.LesageproposedtheideatoPrimeMinister Lester B.Pearson,whothenagreedtoassistintherealizationof the project with federal funds. Soon after in 1964, a national competition was held for the design of the new theatre, and was won by Victor Prus, an architect from nearbyMontreal. Andafterseveralyears,constructiononthetheatre began in September 1967. The theatre officially opened on January 16, 1971 and has since been the home of the Orchestre symphonique de Québec,theOpéradeQuébec,theThéâtreduTrident,alongwith a whole host of other local artistic and musical groups. The theatre also often hosts several events for the city's annual Quebec City Summer Festival. It has also been the hostofa politicalsummitasUnitedStatesPresidentRonaldReagan visited the theatre in 1985 to meet with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney for what has since been referred to as the Shamrock Summit. Upon the opening of the theatre, the famed FrenchCanadian actor and director, Guy Beaulne, was appointed as the theatre's first general manager and director, an office which he would hold for six years. At the time, the theatre was initially known as the Monument commémoratif du centenaire de la Confédération. During the course of its history, the theatre would undergo several name changes, each of which attempted to reflect its original intention to celebrate and commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Confederation of Canada. However, in the end, it was decided that the theatre would be known simply as the Grand Théâtre de Québec. Initially, the theatre was administered by the Corporation of the Grand Théâtre de Québec, which was established in May 1969. However, the corporation was soon dissolved, on July 17, 1970, and a new entity, Régie du Grand Théâtre deQuébec, assumeditsresponsibilities.Thecompanylaterwent on to become a crown corporation on March 30 of 1982, when a bill was passed by the Quebec National Assembly, which made the company directly accountable to the Ministère des Affaires culturelles du Québec or the Quebec Ministry of Cultural Affairs. Since then, the Régie duGrandThéâtrede Québec,nowknownastheSociétédu GrandThéâtrede Québec,hasbeenundertheauthorityofagovernment appointed council. The Grand Théâtre de Québec still operates to this day as a proud testament to the successes of French-Canadian arts and culture.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
Designed for an audience of nearly 1900, the Salle LouisFréchette is optimized for both music and theatre performances. To ensure a consistent acoustic experience throughout the theatre, there are acoustic plate reflectors that are suspended from the ceiling which work to reflect any sound emanating from the stage area to the furthest reaches and corners of the theatre, thereby distributing the sound evenly. These reflectors are adjustable in height and canbe usedcooperativelytocreateawidevarietyofacoustic environments,dependingonboththeattendanceandtypeof performance to occur in the theatre.

THEATRE HISTORY
The Raoul-Jobin Theater in Quebec City is housed within Palais Montcalm and is capable of seating a total of 979 people at any given time. This approximately 822m2 theater includes 2 levels of balcony to the rear and the sides as well as a level of gallery at the rear of the stage. The theater, measuring at around 36m in length, 23m in width and 17m in floor-to-ceiling height, Palais Montcalm that currently stands today is the result of a major 4-year renovation completed in March of 2007. Situated just outside the Old City of Quebec, Palais Montcalm is the contextual and historical anchor of Place d'Youville, the site of the former Montcalm Market. This public market, originally built in 1877 outside of the historic St. John Gate, was partially destroyed by fire. The municipally-owned Palais was based on the design of Ludger Robitaille and Gabriel Desmeule who attempted to incorporate the remains of the original market structure into their design. The original Palais Montcalm, constructed in 1932, was an Art Deco building initially containing offices, a library, a swimming pool (disused since 1986) and a 1,300seat hall decorated in a Neoclassical style. Since then, the building, along with the surrounding context, has witnessed several renovations and changes in building usage throughout the last century. In 1940, the Canadian Broadcasting Company occupied offices in the building and used the concert hall and its recording studio for live music broadcasts and radio programs up until the early 1990s. The building's design is based on a tripartite facade featuring a strong base and cornice, with a large marquee identifying the main entrance. Architectural consortium M.U.S.E. (a collaborative group consisting of Jacques Plante Architect, Les Architectes Bernard et Cloutier, St-Gelais Montminy Architectes) worked closely with acoustic engineer Larry S. King of the New Yorkbased JaffeHolden, for the most recent renovation in 2007. The consortium's acronym stands for "Mission: Urbanit Scnographie Espace­or urbanity, stage design and space". Their mandate, as set by the City of Quebec and the provincial Ministry of Culture and Communications, was to insert a new music hall within the shell of the old building. Rather than to implement a new exterior façade, the architectural consortium focused their attention and energy in re-shaping the interior conditions. In fact, the current Palais Montcalm retains most of the exterior original materiality and architectural language from the original construction. In order to obtain an optimal interior volume for ideal acoustic performance, the designers had the rear wall and roof of the existing building demolished in favour over adding a sixth storey as indicated in their proposed competition drawings. They also decided to excavate under the main hall, thereby maintaining the height of the preexisting building while preserving the sightlines from the ramparts of the walls enclosing the Old City. The reconfigured facility means that concert audience members can enter the parterre at ground level rather than walk up a flight of stairs as they had to do before the renovation. Currently, the Raoul-Jobin theater is the principal venue for a local French-Canadian chamber orchestra called Les Violons du Roy. Taking advantage of the adjustable curtains and suspended acoustical ceiling, the impeccably detailed space offers exceptional sound quality and comfort to artist and music lovers.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
The Raoul-Jobin Theater was designed specifically for a resident Quebecois chamber orchestra called Les Violons du Roy. One of the unique features of this theater is the adjustable canopy system and curtain coverage. This operable feature impacts the reverberation time, which allows the room to be configured in various ways to cater to many different musical styles and genres. Regardless of the orchestra size or musical genre, this theater is capable of providing the desired acoustical atmosphere for both the players and the audience.

a simple curtain system that is a major proprietor for the acoustic quality. The clarity factor has been calculated for 80 ms at six different points in the hall with two different configurations. The concert hall performs a C80 = -0.70 mid frequency for the configuration that favors Les Violons du Roy's playstyle.

The Raoul-Jobin Theater is an acoustically versatile and customizable space that can tune itself to favor certain concert performances. The flexibility of the curtain and canopy system allows for greater acoustic quality when conforming to The canopy system can be adjusted verticality between 11m specific concert types. It is no wonder why the Raoul-Jobin and 15m and is positioned right above the semi-circular stage. Theater is regarded as one of the top in sound quality in The composition of the canopy consists of wood fibers that Canada. are partly covered with an absorbent felt. The variable height affects the reflection and reverberation times as sound travels through the hall. The curtain system envelopes both side walls and the back wall on all three levels as seen in Figure 5. The heavy velvet curtains can be calibrated to cover a certain percentage of the reflective and diffusing walls behind it. This creates different exposures of reflection and diffusion that affects the reverberation time of the acoustics. The hall is finished with a high density maple veneer that is backed with olivine, a volcanic sand. The olivine is used to eliminate any air pockets that might exist within the concrete structure. The wooden veneer panels alternate between glossy and matte finishes. Some panels strategically extrude or recede from the wall which improve the reverberation times and sound diffusion. Along with its acoustic elements, the wooden finish also provides a harmony with the stringed instruments used in the orchestras. Figure 6 shows the sound reflection in the space. All the seats in the theater received direct sound and while not all seats receive reflected sound from the ceiling reflectors, most of the audience members are exposed to the reflected sound from both the ceiling and the walls. The reverberation of the hall is described as homogeneous throughout different concert configurations. As seen in Figure 7, the mid reverberation times can be adjusted between 1.3 seconds to 2.2 seconds due to the different concert configurations used to test the range of the acoustic qualities of the hall. It is determined that the maximal standard deviation is 0.17 seconds at the lower frequencies while it is 0.09 seconds on the whole spectrum. The reverberation time for the Violons Du Roy's concerts is further reduced to 1.8 seconds when the hall is occupied fully. The ranges of reverberation times is described as remarkable for such

THEATRE HISTORY
Designed by Dan Hanganu, Centre des arts Juliette-Lassonde is a widely celebrated cultural hub that houses a 700-seat Desjardins theatre and a 340-to-650-seat RONA cabaret room. Located in the city of Saint-Hyacinthe in the Monteregian region of Québec province, the theater is known for having various famous artists such as Salvatore Adamo, Gary Kurtz, Oliver Jones, Roch Voisine, André-Philippe Gagnon and various events are held at the venue year-round. Saint-Hyancinthe is the main city of Les Maskoutains municipalityofMontérégieregionwhichisthesecondmost populated region of Quebec province after Montreal and alsohometothelongesthistoryofFrenchsettlersinCanada. LocatedinbetweenMontrealandQuebecCity,theregionis ideally situated to produce cultural and artistic innovatives. The building has two main acoustic rooms: a traditional Italian-style "La Salle Dejardins" for for high-end shows and large-scale performances with top quality acoustic equipmentsandtheblack-boxroom"L'EspaceRONA"whichis a mixed-use banquet venue that hosts variety of events and parties. ING Scene is a huge outdoor stage that can accomodate 5000 people with the purpose of providing public space for the social events in the city. It integrates the civic center, the market and commercial streets of the site. The site is also adjacent to the Yamaska River providing scenic view from the plaza. The centre earns its name in honour of Juliette Lassonde who is the mother of four famous figures in Québec: Pierre Lassonde,JudgeMichelLassonde,Dr.JeanLassonde,andLouise Lassonde.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
The three main spaces of the Centre des Arts JulietteLassonde are La Salle Desjardins, Espace RONA, and ING Scene, and out of these spaces the Salle Desjardins is the auditorium room specifically designed for high-end acoustic performance. While the Espace RONA has a performance stage for musical events, it is more of a multifunctional space and ING Scene is an outdoor stage that has less sound control. La Salle Desjardins has been designed for best quality of acoustic experience with its large volume provided by 12.5mhigh ceiling height. This design intent is ideal for sound to reverberate in many different directions thus improving the quality of sound. Interior acoustic features include curved dropped ceiling reflectors act as diffusers to scatter the reflections of sound waves to reduce flutter echo. Additionally, surfaces are flat and non-parallel so the sound reflections do not concentrate in central area of potential echo. Although the building's roof is flat, useful area of ceiling reflection is not minimized by use of ceiling reflectors. In plan, the room is fan-shaped with balcony at second storey level. This layout is ideal to decrease reverberation by dissipating sound to the back while increasing the absorption surface area with upholstered seats and walls. Moreover, this fan plan can accomodate high capacity of audience while keeping them close to the stage. The stage is also enclosed in height different from main auditorium with hard-surfaced overhang to provide sound reflections toward the audience. The seating is sloped in order to distribute sound evenly and to provide good view for each seat. Materiality is also used for ideal acoustics, such as linoleum covered wood floor or variety of curtains surrounding the dressing rooms to absorb sounds from the main auditorium. The maximum capacity is at 700 seatings, which is not a very big space compared to concert halls that can accomodate thousands, but is actually an ideal volume for acoustic space that caters for optimum reverberation time between ranges of theatres and concert halls.

THEATRE HISTORY
The quaint suburb of Terrebonne, Quebec just North of Montreal is home to the Theatre du Vieux-Terrebonne. The site itself is situated on the historic grounds of the old village, stretching alongside the river plain of the Mille-Isles River. The theater was first constructed in 1947 as the Figaro Theatre in which it was later acquired in 1988 as the city of Terrebonne's official auditorium. Following a devastating fire, the theatre remained displaced until 2001 in which the Terrebonne Society of Cultural Development proposed the relocation of the theatre to an open space area located in the heart of the civic centre. This prompted an architectural competition which awarded Atelier TAG as the designated project architects. Prior to the excavation of the site, a team of archaeologists were mandated to dig the area and document the findings. Subsequently, the excavation revealed that the site in which the theatre was to be built-on, was in fact located on top of an old cemetery and adjacent to old church ruins. Due to the historic context of the site, Atelier TAG's design focused on accentuating the relationships from the interior to the exterior. Thus, creating a seamless harmony between nature and culture within the building. In terms of architectural styles of the theatre, Terrebonne pays tribute to the historical context by incorporating an integration of modern and baroque architectural aspects into the design of the building. Throughout the public portions of the building, a modernist style is incorporated with concrete, glass and wood to create bright and open spaces. The auditorium space itself incorporates baroque characteristics into the design to pay tribute to the sense of hierarchy of the spaces meanwhile creating a sense of warmth. Neutral grey hand-waxed acoustic panels are used to line the walls of the multi-use hall. At first glance these panels appear as grey and black stained concrete. However, these panels are specifically used to control the reflection of sound at the back of the performance hall. Similarly, blue velvet upholstered are given a bright colour to tie back into the modernist style of the public spaces, while remaining true to the baroque characteristics.

Often in multi-use theaters, the large seating capacity is increasingly difficult to accommodate good sight lines for users. The performance hall, Salle des Jardins, deals with this sightline issue by introducing a tiered audience space with an audience balcony. Rooms designed for speech often look at bringing the audience closer to the presenter. For this Atelier TAG best exemplifies this relationship by imagining reason, a fan shaped room is often implemented to allow for that the theatre becomes its own landscape and Terrebonne a larger number of people to be closer to the stage. In as an architectural moment. This was accomplished through unamplified music spaces, a narrow rectangular room with the introduction of a downward sloping square that large ceiling heights yield the most efficient results. Considering the Theatre du Vieux-Terrebonne is a mixed-use approaches the theatre. Atelier TAG's response to the historic conditions was to sink the building design into the performance space, both speech and music are ground to diminish the impact of the flying tower on the compromised in form. For this reason, the shape of the landscape. Likewise, the interior topography of space itself resembles both a rectangular room organization interconnected social stages can also be seen as a means of with a subtle fan-shape organization. Overall, the encouraging interior and exterior interaction. Specify to the construction of the theater Theatre du Vieux-Terrebonne, the transparency in materiality is relatively new and has been deemed successful in terms of is specifically located along the west facade, along the acoustical performance. For this reason, the performance viewing platforms to provide observation while being hall has yet to undergo any renovations. observed. As a tribute to the burial sites, Atelier TAG also incorporated the installment of light pods into the ground along the south facade.

ACOUSTICS OF THE SPACE
La Salle Desjardins seats 658 seats with a lower bowl of 441 seats and a balcony of 215 seats. Under acoustical scrutiny, the performance hall excels in sound distribution, reverberation time, noise levels and reflection of sound energy. The design of the theatre improves the sound quality and distribution of sound pressure for the audience. The seats along with the curtains on stage are concealed with velvet, absorbing the background noise coming from movement of the performers and audience. The velvets seats also keeps the sound even, amongst empty and occupied seats. Along the ceiling and walls are decorative acoustical panels, placed convex towards the audience dispersing the sound evenly in the hall. The acoustic panels along the wall act as reflectors for early lateral reflection which is essential for the audience to feel as if they are in a large, spacious room. These acoustic panels were handcrafted by an artists with the intent of a concrete aesthetic. Furthermore, the concave shape of the outer walls concentrate the sound for the balcony spaces higher up from the audience. Specifically in critical listening environments, the reflections from the concave outer walls allow for the user to be surrounded by sound, gaining a sense of envelopment. The first reflector is located above the stage and is placed horizontally in which reflects the sound towards the audience. The second reflector is located above the balcony space. This reflector is slightly angled to ensure that the sound is not reflected into the balcony seats, creating a long delayed reflection. The reflections from the lateral panels and ceiling panels work together to overcome the decrease of sound intensity over time. The reverberation performance of La Salle Desjardins is comparatively better than an average auditorium (1.0s) and movie theatre (1.14s) at 0.93s (Figure 5). The distribution of sound of the performance hall performs as expected, on average a performance hall will decrease 1dB every 100 seats. As humans perceive a sound twice as loud every 10dB, audience of the room only hears slight sound variations in the room as the average sound pressure difference is 5dB (Figure 7, Figure 8). The maximum sound difference between the best and worst seat in Le Theatre du Vieux-Terrebonne is 7dB, a performance expected for its 658 seats. The side seats of the lower portion of the hall see almost a 5dB difference, which is greatly improved by the reflecting surfaces of the side walls and porous back wall. Due to the reflections of the hard back wall, the back seats of the room performs well with only a 2dB difference. Five amplifiers (Crown Macro-Tech) and six equalizers are

placed in the hall to minimize uneven frequencies in the space. The amplified sound system for the performers replaces the need for reflective acoustic panels above and on the sides of the performers on stage. The noise level of the performance hall performed below the maximum allowed noise level for average theatres at Noise Criteria 30 (NC-30). During a performance, the average noise level of the hall is NC-26.2 (Figure 6). At all frequencies from 31.5Hz-16000Hz, the Noise Criteria does not exceed NC-30. The cause of the background noise was predicted to be poor ventilation and poor soundproofing of the interior of the building. In addition, the external noise from the street and waterfront are also a plausible factor to consider. The average background noise level heard during performance is 32.7dB at 170Hz, a noise comparable to a whisper. Whereas, the maximum background noise level heard during performance is 57.9dB at 31.5Hz, comparable to a conversation. The velvet material selected for the curtains and seats work to minimize redundant noise coming from backstage and seat movement. The porous and thick velvet converts sound energy to heat energy through friction.

THEATRE HISTORY
Opened in 1970, the Conexus Arts Centre ­ originally known as the Saskatchewan Centre of the Arts, is a theatre complex located with the Wascana Centre in Regina. The centre is home to the Regina Symphony Orchestra, and various programs for Regina College. It proved to be a replacement site to Darke Hall, Regina Theatre, and several other buildings in the area due to complications such as fires, and demolitions. Although the building was intended as a Canadian centennial project for 1967, construction was delayed, due to the unavailable funding for the steel structure, and unique Vermont marble cladding. The final price tag came out to be $7.7 million after the use of Estevan brick and several other cutbacks. Designed by architects, Izumi, Arnott, and Sugiyama, Conexus Arts Centre houses a Main Theatre, a Convention Hall and a variety of conference rooms, and lobby spaces. The Main Theatre which houses the Regina Symphony Orchestra year-round can accommodate audiences up to 2031 seats, while the Convention Hall seats 1600. The Main Theatre's focal point is a large stage with a front lowering hydraulic system to create an orchestra pit for approximately 100 musicians. Additionally, three balconies overlook the performance space. The Concert Hall was constructed in Regina's Wascana Centre which includes public buildings and landscapes, and Regina College campus facilities. Being created in 1962 by architect Minoru Yamasaki, he aimed for a modernist plan for the college ­ a style which suited well with the "featureless"Regina plain. Therefore the Conexus Arts Centre was designed to fit in with the campus architecture. The schematic design by Izumi, Arnott, and Sugiyama had and still has a modernist feel to it with the use of brick, stone, and concealed steel. It follows the common characteristics of this 20th century movement such as;"form follows function", simplicity in form, 90 degree angles, and the revealing of natural materials which ought to be seen rather than concealed or altered to represent something else. These themes are present in the Centre ­ most notably on the exterior of the Main Theatre. The square floor plan, along with the highly extruded roof accommodates the balconies and performance stage within the interior. The exterior's grey brick may even be resembled to the 60's and 70's Brutalist architectural movement. With the above mentioned, although the architects' vision for the building was not 100 percent fully fulfilled due to construction costs, it still adhered to its surroundings. As previously mentioned before, completion for 1967 could not be done, and due to several material and construction cutbacks, the Conexus Arts Centre finished in 1970. In 1967, the unfinished steel structure glared over the campus and landscape ­ some dubbed the structure as the "world's largest monkey bars." In the following years, and through the 21st century, maintenance and renovation projects went underway which substantially brought the appearance the building substantially closer to the original design intent. Large lobby, conference, and warm up spaces allow for social and physical congregation between staff, students, and the public. Lighting in the lobbies, and theatres can be controlled for adequate sight. For the main theatre, the acoustics are suitable for high quality performances. The grand drape which wraps around the walls conceals the stage, and at the same time controls the reverberation of sound. Additionally, not only are the materials (spruce flooring and ceiling pieces etc.) visually pleasing to the eye, but are ideal for controlling an ideal reverberation time due to its absorption characteristics. The Conexus Arts Theatre falls under a Sound indoor (with boundary surface absorption) acoustic situation. This indicates that although sound is absorbed, a large amount of its waves are reflected throughout the theatre for the audiences' pleasure. For instance, the slanted ceiling condition, and narrowing walls (toward the stage) ensure ceiling, side wall, and direct sound path reflection. More ineptly, the incident sound from the performers travels outward toward the audience, and while most is absorbed by acoustic panels, a relative amount is reflected by the wall surface beneath back to the listener. In conclusion the Conexus theatre proves to be ideal for listening pleasure and quality sound. A further analysis of the specific acoustic parameters of the space are mentioned in Part E.

Serving as a Theatre and Concert hall for both local and travelling performers, The Conexus Arts Centre addresses a large audience in its main theatre. This main space can hold a capacity of up to 2037 viewers. The theatre is arranged in three steeply raked tiers to allowing for an optimum viewing and listening angles, while still maintaining a level of intimacy with the stage and the performers. The theatre accommodates dramatic and musical performances, as well as ceremonies held by the nearby University of Regina. It is commonly used to graduations and recitals in which the seating and stage must be reconfigured. It is also frequently used as a private facility for social functions such as wedding receptions. The stage arrangement of the Conexus Centre is reconfigurable in order to support a wide range of performances and events. The stage can be hydraulically raised and lowered providing an orchestra pit capable of handling up to 100 musicians. The area above the front of the main stage features four movable ceiling panels that help to reflect sound into the seating of the theatre. Similarly, the ceiling of the main seating area features a patterned panel system in order to reflect sound back into the seating area of the theatre. Along the side walls of the theatre, porous wall panels are used to absorb some of the sound produced during the performance. The centers ability to alter the stage depth as well as ceiling height over the stage area is able to support a wide range of performances. The lowered stage condition can create a reduced reverberation time, which is desired during an orchestral performance. Similarly, the drop ceiling acoustic panels can further control reverberation time during these events where acoustic control is so crucial. In contrast, during ceremonies and larger public events, the stage can be elevated and the drop ceiling panels can be removed, to result in a higher reverberation time, as acoustic control is not as crucial during these larger public galas and ceremonies. The audio of the theatre is monitored and controlled in a specific room immediately behind the first balcony which is also able to control projected imagery and some of the lighting. The sound quality in the room is achieved by two Tannoy Precision 8 monitors, a Yamaha M7CL mixer, three Crown K1 Amplifiers. The speaker system used by the Conexus Arts Centre, features 2 EAW LF SB118 Subwoofers, 4 EAW KF300 Speakers and 4 EAW JF80 Speakers. Overall, the Conexus Centre has always been noted for its acoustically perfect performance setting, and adaptable stage arrangements to allow for all types of performances and events.
