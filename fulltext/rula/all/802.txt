ABSTRACT

FORECASTING STOCK MARKET WITH NEURAL NETWORKS By Hua Jiang, B.Eng., China, 1995 A dissertation presented to Ryerson University In partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in the program of Mechanical Engineering Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 2003

The objective of this project is to use neural networks to forecast next day's stock closing price. In the past, researcht:rs used different methods to forecast stock price such as technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and economic analysis. Forecasting stock prices is a problem that has been usually approached in terms of weekly, monthly, or quarterly forecast. This project aims at finding a feasible way, by using neural networks, to make daily forecasts. Most methods proposed so far, such as technical, fundamental and economic analysis, are limited to solving the problem as a long term trend analysis. Thus, these methods either lack accuracy or add extra expenses to the forecasting task, especially if a company's fundamental statistics are out of date. Therefore it is difficult to forecast day-to-day close price as a nonlinear problem. In this study, three portfolios are created. Portfolio #1 is based on subjective forecasts, Portfolio #2 uses a neural network to forecast, and Portfolio

#3 using CAPM optimizer forecast. A comparison of these portfolios showed that the CAPM optimization based on neural network forecast (Portfolio #3) achieved the highest return. The degree of accuracy is compared in three economic periods: the beginning of recession; the middle of recession; and the beginning of recovery. Stock forecasting example cases are given to illustrate this neural network approach to solve nonlinear problems. It is observed, indeed, that next day closing prices are forecast with better accuracy within a one-year period than other methods.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

According to Carter [3], a survey conducted by the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1989 revealed that "Twenty-three percent of all Canadians owned stocks or mutual funds. This means that over 5.5 million Canadians invest in the stock market. Well over 4 million of them own shares directly in their own name rather than through mutual funds. Of the 4 million-plus Canadians who invest in the market only about eight percent have accounts over $50, 000, but most are less than $10,000". The significance in collecting the right data and identifying the type of investors is the key to the analysis of stock market where more and more Canadians invest. An important tool for making investment decisions is forecasting. Forecasting is a common activity in stock market investment. There are several methods (techniques) such as statistical methods, mathematical modeling, fundamental analysis, technical analysis etc. In the 1990s, techniques based on artificial intelligence approaches began to be used. One such technique uses artificial neural network for forecasting. Neural networks have many features as a data analysis tool, and a relatively efficient implementation scheme in tenns of computation speed and computer memory requirements. The advent of such a powerful technique naturally attracted the interest of the finance community and economists. The objective of this project is to develop a neural network for forecasting next day prices using seven input factors believed to influence prices. The seven factors are as follows:

- 1-

1. T -bill Rate (TR);

2. Consumer Price Index (CPI); 3. Money Supply (MS);

4. Market Index Average (MIA);
5. Unemployment Rate (UR);

6. Monthly Data (MD);

.-

7. Daily Data (DO);
The rationale for choosing these specific factors is explained in detail in Section 3.5. The stock data is quoted in dollars. The value of money works directly on the quotation of stock, and thus forecast results are quoted in dollars. Industry generally uses the 3 months T-Bill rate as an equivalent indicator of interest rate. This is because the Treasury bill rate is calculated actording to the currency reserve in the Central Bank and interest rate is calculated according to the currency reserve in the Central Bank too. Therefore when the reserve changes, the T-Bill rate and the interest rate move proportionally according to the same factor. In this project, T -Bill rate is considered as an essential indicator of economic health. Concerning stock market, the stock prices respond directly to the limit of credit controlled by the Federal Reserve. Therefore, stocks are priced for their value. Stocks as financial instruments have their fair value and limits. According to Kenneth [6], "Price limits are artificial boundaries established by market regulators to confine daily movements of security prices. Price limits are currently used in the U.S. futures market and in many stock exchanges around the world including: Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Spain,

Switzerland, Taiwan, and Thailand". Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that stock price can't go beyond this limit in this project. According to Schulz [10], "The market is always to be considered as having three movements, all going on at the same time. The first is the narrow movement from day to day. The second is the short swing, running from two weeks to a month or more; the third is the main movement, covering at least four years in its duration." This project is concerned ~ith day to day movem.ent. Therefore, daily adjusted close price is used as an indicator in forecasting the following day close price. During this project, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 18% and the TSE300 index lost 13%. The DJIA closed at 10073.4 and the TSE300 Index closed at 7646.8 in January. At the end of year 2002, DJIA closed at 8341.63 and TSE300 Index closed at 6614.5. Three portfolios are created to compare three forecasting techniques. In Portfolio #1, buying and selling are based on random decisions.·Portfolio # 2 uses a Neural Network with input factors to make buy/sell decisions. Finally, buying and selling in Portfolio # 3 is based on daily Beta. There are ten stocks in each portfolio. The results of the comparison showed. that portfolio #2 outperformed both portfolio #1 and the market indices. However, the highest return among the three was still achieved by portfolio #3, with daily Beta.

CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW

I
I
1 1 I

In this chapter, the history of Neural Networks and its use in forecasting the stock market using generalization is reviewed. Then the CAPM model widely used in the security analysis industry is reviewed.

2.1 REVIEW OF BPN FORECAST ON STOCK MARKET

! t
~

In the past decade, neural network prediction models attracted many enthusiastic researchers. The literature within our research scope include Alunadi [1], Choi et al [4], Kohara et al [7]. They concluded that neural network models outperformed the benchmark models in index return. In this project, the factors considered are generally economic and market variables and we feed these selected data to the BPN neural network under study.

2.2 ADVENT OF NEURAL NETWORK MODEL

The study of human brain has never stopped. Nowadays, scientists can basically understand the function of nerves and neurons in the human brain and the functional allocation of each physical part. On the path, the advancement of computer technology has allowed computer scientists to use computer program to simulate the single neuron firing process and organize it in a complex way to carry out the basic tasks that the human brain does. According to Wilde [12], "A human brain consists of about 10 to the power of 11 nerve cells. The protrusions of the soma are of two different kinds, called axons and

j-

dendrites. There are about 10 to the power of 9 meters ofaxons, axon branches and dendrites. This is about 25 times the circumference of the earth." Further, Wilde [12] points out that "Neurons communicate through the exchange of ions. The ions carry electric charges. Because ofthe changing ion concentration inside the neurons, voltage spikes will travel in the neuron. When the spike arrives at the synapse, neurotransmitters (complex molecules) are released. A neuron that has not fired, because it did not reach the threshol~ for firing, loses its p~tential to fire gradually. This is sometimes called leakage, in analogy with an electric current leaking away." Based on the understanding of these logic, Neural Networks were developed.

2.3 MAJOR CONTRIBITORS TO NN MODEL
The major milestones in the BPN model development, according to Fu [5] are:
,

.

- McCulloch and Pitts introduced the first abstract neuron model - 1940. - Hebb proposed a learning law that explained how a network of neurons learned- 1949. - Rumelhart and McClelland published "Parallel Distributed processing- 1985. - Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams developed backpropagation learning algorithm as a powerful solution to training a multiplayer neural network- 1986.

2.4 ARTIFICIAL NEURON AND MLP
This section describes the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network model that has been developed as an effective and powerful model for performing supervised learning tasks. Through adjusting the weights of connections between neurons, the MLP can be

trained to solve non-linear optimization problem i.e. stock price data. The remainder of the project is concerned with input data selection procedure and the training and forecast examples. The Backpropagation algorithm is carried out by presenting input data at the input layer and assigning weights to inter neuron connections. The input data is then propagated through the hidden layers until it reaches the output layer. The resulting output is compared with the desired output, and the difference is propagated back to the first layer (backpropagation). The weights are adjusted in a way to minimize the error and a new value is calculated as the output in the second epoch. In this way, data is

I
i

propagated forward, and errors are propagated backward through the network thousands of times (epochs) until, the output error is minimized. The connection weights can be compared to the synaptic strength of biological neuronal networks. Details on the BP algorithm are found in Chapter 6 of "Artificial Neural Networks" by Schalkoff [9]. Artificial neurons are based on the all-or-nothing property of neuron firing, in a discrete time scale.

2.5 COMPUTATION USING MLP'S SUPERVISED LEARNING

The MLP architecture feeds activation forward along the network and it feeds the error back along the network. Thus it is a non-recurrent network. In recurrent networks,

I

the activation of the output layer is fed back to the network. In neural network, some commonly used activation functions are the sigmoid functions, such as the logistic

and the hyperbolic tangent f(a)

= tanh(a) = ~-r _.
Q

When the network

is fully trained, the input domain and the output domain are mapped through the weight matrix that can be saved and used for later forecast. This project is concerned with using MLP to perform supervised learning tasks. We use Mean Squared Error (MSE)

2.6 GENERALIZATION AND MODEL COMPLEXITY

In practice, generalization means that a trained NN can generate correct outputs for new input data patterns that were not part of the training set. According to Tamura and Tareishi [11], ''The goal of supervised learning is not to learn an exact representation of the training data itself, but rather to build a statistical model of the process which generates the data". The study of neural network generalization is directly related to the complexity of the model. Tradeoffs are often made for the particular tasks of the network. According to the readings, a simpler neural network generalizes better than a more complex neural network, and forecasts better result in cases where the output data has not been included in the input data set. Thus these kinds of neural networks are more robust. On the other

hand, to increase the accuracy of the network, a more complex network is needed. The requirements of generalization vs. accuracy are compared in Table 2.

Table 2: Generalization vs. Accuracy

From the table represented in Kevin's book, we conclude that a simpler network structure is essential to take advantage of the generalization of neural networks. We can also avoid to over train the neural network and extract rules of noise data that doesn't belong to the mapping process.

2.7 MATH MODEL ON STOCK PRICE

According to Kohara et al. [7], there are two approaches in determining stock price with mathematical models. These are traditional statistical analysis and dynamic system. Market decisions are based on the agent's personal strategy, learning availability, availability of information [7].

2.8 CAPM MODEL ON STOCK PRICE
Capital Asset Pricing Model is a single factor model in determining stock price based on the risk averse value. In this model, investment return, rj, is based on the expected return plus the level of response ( P; ) to the single factor.

GivenE(r) is known, fJ;can be predicted and thus the return on asset i.e. stock price can
be determined correspondingly. In a stock market, the single factor is the market index, and thus a single index model can determine the stock price.

2.9 SUMMARY OF REVIEW Success in designing a neural network depends on a clear understanding ofthe problem. Knowing which input variables are important in the market being forecasted is

I I
i
J

critical. This is easier said than done because the very reason for relying on a neural network is for its powerful ability to detect complex nonlinear relationships among a number of different variables. However, economic theory can help in choosing variables that are likely important predictors. At this point in the forecasting process, the concern is about the raw data from which a variety of indicators will be developed. These indicators will form the actual inputs to the neural network. The financial researcher interested in forecasting market prices must decide whether to use both technical and fundamental economic inputs from one or more markets. Technical inputs are defined as lagged values of the dependent variable or indicators calculated from the lagged values. Fundamental inputs are economic variables that are believed to influence the dependent variables or their first difference as inputs. A more popular approach is to calculate various technical indicators that are based only on past prices (and occasionally volume and lor open close price) of the ticker being forecasted. As an additional improvement, inter market data can be used since the close link between all kinds of markets, both domestically and internationally, suggests that using technical inputs from a number of interrelated markets should improve forecasting performance. For example, the price of NorteI Networks in NYSE and in TSE could be used as neural network inputs when forecasting the NT ticker. Fundamental information such as the yield, PIE ratio, volatility, or overvalue and undervalue effects may also be helpful.

The frequency of the data depends on the objective of the researcher. A typical off-floor trader in the stock or commodity futures markets would most likely use daily data if designing a neural network as a component of a overall trading system. An investor with a longer-tenn horizon may use weekly or monthly data as inputs to the neural network to fonnulate the best asset mix rather than using a passive buy and hold strategy. An economist forecasting the GDP, unemployment, or other broad economic indicators would likely use monthly or quarterly data. . .

To narrow down our training data frequency and to consider the possible effects and limits on forecasting results, daily data is selected. The data frequencies such as seasonal, quarterly, monthly and weekly are not considered in this project, which uses only daily data. However, because of their potential impact on the performance of the neural network, a brief explanation of each effect is given next.

3.1 SEASONAL EFFECT
Some stocks react to seasonal changes very much. It is so significant to consider stocks such as farming, leather, tourism, and hotel industry. The weather changes, road conditions, icing condition all can affect the stock price given other factors to be constant. Seasonal changes affect the profits of many industries, especially those whose sales depend heavily on weather or holiday influences. For example, if the summer is abnormally hot, the soft drink, air conditioning, leisure-time equipment and related industries may naturally be expected to benefit. But if the summer is colder than usual, their earnings may be disappointing. Likewise, Christmas and Easter bestow their seasonal blessings on the retail industry, while farm equipment makers ben~fit from early spring and summer. Seasonal market cycles such as these do not apply to the scope of this project due to the lack of data. Most stocks that are listed in Exchanges are less than five years in history; therefore to collect data on a seasonal basis is no't feasible.

3.2 MONDAY EFFECT
The tenn "Black Monday" refers to the market crashes of Monday Octoberl9, 1987 and Monday October28, 1929. The Monday in 1929 was the beginning of the ten years great depression, in which the stock market basically collapsed and bankers and stock investors lost everything in their investment. Moreover, on the Monday of October28, 1929, DJIA dropped 508 points about 22.6% and S&P 500 lost 20.5% while NASDAQ Composite lost 11.3%. Not surprisingly, Black Monday still affects investors' psychology.

3.3 WEEKEND EFFECT
According to Miller [8], the negative returns over weekends are caused by a "shift in broker to investor balance". Miller argues that individuals focus on current needs on weekends, while market tends toward buy recommendations during the week. His hypothesis has been observed by the increasing number of odd lot orders in decrease number of institutional round log orders. Even if it is interesting to test the weekend effect, it is not considere~ because the scope of the project is limited to day traders and pattern day traders.

3.4 QUARTERLY EFFECT
Quarterly earnings play an important role in detennining the stock price. When the quarterly earnings are published, good earnings often drive the stock price up and bad earnings generally drive the price down given the same market condition. However, the finn's specific risk is also influenced by market risk. For stocks that have positive Beta value, the market price generally moves in the same direction as the intra-day market

direction. For stocks that have negative Beta value, the market price generally moves in the opposite direction to the market index. Should we use the quarterly effect as an input neuron, the duration of the project may last up to ten years to test the validity and collect the data. Thus the quarterly market cycle does not fall into the scope of this project due to the lack of data. Most stocks that are listed in Exchanges are less than five years in history; therefore to collect seasonal data is not feasible.

i

3.5 INPUTS SELECTION

Interest Rate Factor
The 91 days Treasury bill rate as the interest rate is an input to the neural network. According to bank of Canada's report, substantial changes in the volatility of stock market returns are capable of having significant negative effects on risk averse investors. Such changes can impact on corporate capital budgeting decisions, investors' consumption decisions, and other business cycle variables. At the same time, it has been widely accepted that interest rate has immediate and direct impact on the stock market performance [2].

Consumer Price Index Factor
The CPI, calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is called an inflation indicator. The Consumer Price Index is an estimation of the price changes for a typical basket of goods. In other words, the prices of everyday goods such as housing, food, education, clothing, etc., are compared from one month to the next and the difference represents the CPI. The goods are weighted appropriately in order to get an accurate

measure. The CPI carries important factors of cost of living and is used by the Federal Reserve when deciding the changes that need to be made to the interest rates as well as by investors when trying to predict the future price of securities. Indeed, when inflation is rising, it causes people to buy fewer goods, therefore reducing the profits of companies. This earning reduction may cause the company to become short of cash or to suffer a quarterly loss. Therefore, share price goes down. ! I

Money Supply Factor
Money supply is used as an input neuron to the neural network model. There are two types of money supply, Ml & M2. Ml includes all coins and currency held by the public, traveler's checks, checking account balances, NOW accounts, automatic transfer service accounts, and balances in credit unions. M2 includes Ml, plus savings and small time deposits, overnight repos at commercial banks, and non-institutional money market accounts. A key economic indicator used to forecast inflation, it is widely accepted that the M2 is an important gauge of Federal Reserve strategy and economic potential. If the annual rate of change in money supply is running under 3% stocks will typically struggle [2]. The money supply; M2, is the third input factor for the neural network.

Market Index Average Factor
In the exchange, MIA is designed to measure price changes of an overall market, such as the stock market or the bond market. An example is Vanguard's Total Bond Market Index. In this project, the DJIA and TSE are considered. These two factors

are statistical indicators providing a representation of the value of the securities. They often serve as barometers for a given market or industry and benchmarks against which financial or economic performance is measured. The special effect of political news on MIA is taken in these data sets, e.g., War effect and the September 11 effect are all reflected in the TSE and DJIA indices. [2]

Unemployment Rate Factor
Unemployment news carries two primitive types of information relevant for valuing stocks: information about future interest ra~es and future- corporate earnings and dividends. According to bank of Canada's report, an announcement of rising unemployment is good news for stocks during economic expansions and bad news during economic contractions. Stock pric~s usually increase on news of rising unemployment, since the economy is usually in an expansion phase. A rise in unemployment rate typically signals a decline in interest rates, which is good news for stocks, as well as a decline in future corporate earnings and dividends, which is bad news for stocks. According to bank of Canada's report, there is a strong relationship between stock prices and macroeconomic news, such as news about unemployment rate. According to bank of Canada's report, monthly stock returns are negatively correlated with the per capita labor income growth rate. They argued that since most of the variation in per capita labor income arises from variation in hours worked and not the wage rate, their findings are consistent with the unconditional positive correlation between unemployment rate and stock returns. Therefore unemployment rate is used as an input factor [2].

Monthly Data Factor This is the past five-year's stock monthly-adjusted close. These data are easily available from Internet open sources and carry a firm's specific risk and nature of business performance result under the past economic environment. A five-year period is used in this project because industry widely accepts five years as an economy business cycle. The close price is adjusted based on stock dividends and the pre and after market hour trading ,data. Details can be found at http://finance.yahoo.com

Daily Data Factor This data set contains the 60 days adjusted close price of a particular stock under testing. The method of using adjusted close price to forecast next day closing price is called Predict Day Close (POe). PDC can catch the movement and trend of a particular stock on a daily basis. News happening during market hours is not considered in this factor.

Figure 3. BPN Structure

A backpropagation neural network (BPN) was designed for the predict day close (PDC) method. This BPN network (see figure 3), has three layers with seven input neurons and a number of hidden neurons that is detennined according to the volatility of the stock data in the past 60 trading days. If the stock price deviation from the two-month mean price is over 20%, there should be less hidden neurons i.e. five
neuro~s.

If the stock

price deviation from the two-month mean price is less than 20%, we use fifteen neurons. This method of selecting the number of hidden layers is based on trial and error observation, and is described in the following section. Network connections are initialized with random weight matrix. The procedure for obtaining the values for the input neurons is discussed in details in the following chapter. The input data is applied to the NN at the end of a business day. Its output, DD' is the forecast change (%) in the

closing of the stock in the following business day. The value ofDD' ranges between -1.0 and +1.0. For example, a value ofDD'= 0.0062 means a 0.62% increase in the stock price. An illustrative example of an actual input pattern is: TR= -0.049, CPI= -0.0496, MS=0.0397, MIA= 0, UR= -0.0147, MD= 0.0216, DD= 0.0108. Using a trained network with 15 hidden neurons, and using the intermediate weights to forecast the next day's close price DD'= 0.0062 is obtained.

3.8 TRAINING THE NEURAL NETWORK

The purpose of training is to minimize the output error and reach the closest forecast result. In the process of training, we compare each trail in terms of rate of convergence. First, use five hidden neurons, and stop training at 10000 epochs, record error 0.078256. Second, use six hidden neurons, and stop training at 10000 epochs, record error 0.078023. Third, use seven hidden neurons, and stop training at 10000 - 23Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.

epochs, record error 0.077332. Fourth, calculate the rate of convergence between trial! and 2 that is (0.078023 - 0.078256), rate of convergence between trial 2 and 3. Fifth, increase the number of hidden neurons. Sixth, when the rate of convergence decreases, that is the optimal hidden layer point. The determination of hidden neurons is done in the initial stage and the number stays the same afterwards.

CHAPTER 4 CASE STUDIES

Ten experiments were repeated in 250 trading days using a trained BPN neural network model. In this project, the market was tested at the start of recession; in the middle of the recession, and finally at the start of recovery. In this section, the statistical data of neural network implementation on a single stock is provided. Then, implementation on a portfolio of 10 stocks on one day is done. Finally, the result of one year's investment return is summarized.

4.1 SINGLE STOCK EXAMPLE

The trading simulation with the neural network involves making investment decisions based on the neural network model. The forecasted result of Portfolio #1, Portfolio #2, and Portfolio #3 is compared. The purpose of this section is to illustrate the model implementation by brining it to real-world data.

4.2 COLLECTION OF INPUT-TARGET PATTERN PAIRS

In this section procedures and data used in predict day close (PDC) testing are described. First, topics such as the origin of the data, their description in statistical terms as well as their quality are covered. Second, the procedure of their integration in order to create the output patterns for the training and for the forecasting is described. Third, data that will be compatible with the models we use are described.

The data considered in PDC method is obtained from Yahoo Inc. These prices have to be easily reachable and updated everyday. In order to avoid data discrepancy, data period verification, frequency check and scaling is done when the factors such as split or reverse split is involved. Briefly, one stock with symbol T is chosen, and forecasts for three portfolios is obtained. The intra day close price using the forecasted results is calculated. The dynamic Beta is obtained for the trading day from the neural network's output. Ordinary least squares regression is run on the data to find the slope that is the Beta and achieve the intra day close price.

Suppose Bi is the value of the rate or index in month i. The following steps for testing on three portfolios are used. The flow chart of the three portfolios is described in figure 5 below:

In the sample given in this section, there are no missing values. However very often, there may be missing data of one day without trade, or one day stock price went out of range such as 3 times because of 1:3 reverse split. The next step is to investigate the outliers. The first (Ql) and third quartile (Q3) distribution is calculated, i.e. 25-th and 75-th percentiles respectively. Any value that is greater than Q3 + 5(Q3 -Ql) or lower than QI -5(Q3-Ql) is an outlier. The price change is defined as B;+I - B; where B; is the B; adjusted close price of day i. In this project, we chose to transform data to neural network ready decimals. In this way, our neural network can be used to stock of any type, i.e. from penny stocks under the $5 value to stocks of $500 in value.

4.SINTERMEDIATE WEIGHTS
In order to estimate the importance level of each factor, we illustrate the 3D graph of the weights matrix extracted beginning from Tuesday and ended in Monday. Note, the training in this example used 7 hidden units in the Neural Network. The following is an example of one random week's descriptive data of weight matrix extracted from the daily training data and thatis used to forecast th~ daily close price.

Figure 14. Tuesday 3D Weights The overall importance level of input neurons from high to low sequence is MD, MS, MIA, CPI, TR, and UR from the 12 months average of weights recorded on 10 stocks. Neural Networks can be used to make short-term or long-term forecasts. The data can be intraday, daily, weekly or monthly and the patterns can be as short as one day or as long as many years.

4.6 OUTPUT DATA OPTIMIZATION
The optimized results are based on the following selection process. From the regression result of each stock on a testing day, the daily Beta is obtained and the forecast to achieve the maximum return is observed in our Portfolio #3. For example, for the September 5, 2003 forecast, a regression for the past 7 days is performed and results are presented. The regression data are shown in Table 17. Next the daily Beta is computed using EXCEL. The daily Betas in the forecasts of the 3 AT&T case studies described earlier are given in Table 18, along with the corresponding CAPM.

The CAPM Estimator clearly indicates the trend. There is a bigger Beta with Mean 0.0 163 at the beginning of recession and our neural network forccast result should he more influenced hy the general stock market perf(1mlanCe, howe\er the ncgati\e alpha \\'ith mean

indicates that T is much more lisky than the general market at

January 2002. There is a moderate Beta with Mean 0.0042 at the middle of recession and our neural network forecast result should be less influenced by the general stock market perfonnance, and the moderate negative alpha with mean ~ 10.2692 indicates that T is still risky than the general market at September 2003. There is a small Beta with Mean 0.0022 at the beginning of recovery and our neural network forecast result should be less influenced by the general stock market perfonnance, and the positive alpha with mean 1.7791 indicates that T is now a safer stock than the general market perfonnance. This is reasonable since this stock and the market is highly correlated. Thus the data in the output is validated.

Repeating the same forecast and optimization on a portfolio often stocks, the everyday dynamic Beta of our portfolio is obtained. The following is an example of daily Beta obtained.

Table 20: Summary of Dynamic Beta

A higher Beta means the stock has more systematic risk; a lower Beta means the stock has less systematic risk. For example, if MIA changes one percent, AC stock will likely change 1.993 percent.

4.7 ONE-YEAR IMPLEMENTATION RESULT

To summarize the overall result of one-year testing result the invcstment rcturn and adjusted stock weights in the portfolio are calculated.

The negative return on portfolio #1 tells us that unless all the 10 companies are well known, it is very risky to setup the portfolio based on the investor's own choice. The neural network portfolio tells us that it is possible to do better than the market. The positive holding period return reached 31 %, and that is much better than market indexes. Table 21: Stock Weights In One Portfolio

The table lists the optimized neural network portfolio composition and adjusted weights between 10 stocks. With the multi-method neural network model, it is possible to achieve a positive return when the market suffers a loss. The positive holding period return was R3%, which is better than market indices. Using Excel processing correlation function on each input data, v;e obtained the follol,ving correlation.

In this project, it is considered that each noise factor works differently on the final forecasted result, it is important to find out the correlation between noise factors and the input factors. The above is a sample correlation matrix for each factor that passed through the network in optimized method.

CHAPTER 5. CONCLUSION

5.1 SUMMARY OF CONTRIBUTIONS
The goal of this project was to forecast next day's stock close price. In this study, three portfolios were created. They were Portfolio #1 using subjective forecast; Portfolio #2 using neural network forecast and Portfolio #3 using CAPM optimized forecast. A comparison of these portfolios showed that the CAPM optimization based on neural network forecast (Portfolio #3) achieved the highest return. The degree of accuracy was compared in three economic periods, i.e. the beginning of recession, the middle of the recession and the beginning of recovery. Stock forecasting example cases were given to illustrate this neural network approach to solve nonlinear problems. Neural networks indeed forecasted next day's closing price with better accuracy within one-year period than other methods. In the training and forecast process, the following inputs were used: T -bill rate of change, Consumer Price Index rate of change, Money Supply rate of change, Market Index Average rate of change, Unemployment Rate value of change, Daily Stock Price rate of change. These decimals were fed to the input layer of the network and compared with the following day's target change in stock price. After the training, the extracted weights matrices were used as intermediate data to forecast the next day's close price rate of change. This same procedure is repeated on ten stocks continuously for one year.
It was found that neural network forecast can help individual investors to improve

their investment return given a free trade environment without commission and trade cost i.e. the test and recommendations in this project assumed zero cost of buy/sell. For a

single stock, the neural network achieved better result at the beginning of each economic cycle, such as beginning of recession and beginning of recovery than in the middle of recession. Results suggested that intra-day stock traders and online investors can achieve better return by using neural network forecast method when compared to economic data forecast, fundamental forecast and technical forecast. They cannot use economic data analysis to forecast stock price because most economic data are not published daily. They cannot use fundamental analysis to forecast stock price because fundamental data available to the public are very limited. They cannot use technical analysis to forecast stock price because chartists are considered as professionals and most investors do not master the techniques of reading stock charts. Finally, it was recommended that they use computers to run the neural network program, take seven inputs and obtain the forecasted next day closing price within minutes. Based on ten stocks portfolio return, it was concluded that the single neural network portfolio did significantly better than initial portfolio and the market indices. The forecasting model is highly efficient in capitalized free trade market i.e. US and Canada. In sequence of decreasing order of importance, the overall importance level of input neurons from high to low sequence as observed in this study was MD, MS, MIA, CPI, TR, and UR from the 12 months average of weights recorded on 10 stocks.

5.2 DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
The goal of forecasting daily closing price allows the investors and users of neural network forecast to do one trade on each stock only. More frequent trading cannot be

done because actual commission resulting from frequent trading could be very high. For example, if a user invests $ 10,000, buy and sell the same stock three times a day, the actual commission could be quite significant. Moreover, most stocks are not volatile enough to reach three or more peaks or bottom enough to cover the commission of trades. However, it is possible that some VIP clients were given fixed rate unlimited trade service by their brokers in the future. If that becomes reality, a more frequent forecast would be very interesting and a research on shorter forecast frequency than one day would be definitely worthwhile to be studied.
