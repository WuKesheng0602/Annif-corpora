Abstract A platform to highlight meaningful work.

This paper details the conceptual and initial prototype design of the online platform called Chunk, which aims to highlight personal projects and put passion-driven ideas at the forefront of an individual's online profile. This paper will define "meaningful work," and outline how the foundations, characteristics, and triggers of flow, play, and "chunking" connect with "meaningful work". It describes why applying them into an online platform, such as Chunk, can help users use their own projects to find greater intrinsic meaning in work. It addresses the lack of focused attention in current social media platforms, within creative work and productivity, and how chunk is able to provide a solution. This paper presents initial images of Chunk's interface, and strategies to implement flow, play, and pattern recognition into its architecture. Lastly, this research paper will analyse and compare LinkedIn, Behance, Pinterest, and Climb (online platforms oriented towards work) to Chunk's platform.

Introduction

A platform to highlight meaningful work By using flow theory, processes of play, and studies built around intrinsic motivation, I am creating a platform which highlights personal projects, and lets passion driven ideas be at the forefront of an individual's profile. This platform will help a person gather relevant information to further materialize their ideas, and to then share it back to others in their network. I have proposed a platform called Chunk, named after "chunking," the learning process of taking individual bits of information and grouping them into larger units. On top of improving memory, "chunking" is proven to improve pattern recognition, and being a fundamental source for associating learning and meaning (Oakley, B., 2016). In this report, I will detail the foundations of flow, play, and "chunk" learning, and how they are related to a working definition of "meaningful work." I will also highlight my development in translating my research into an online platform. Lastly, I will conclude with a comparison to related online platforms: Behance, LinkedIN, Pinterest, and a new app platform called climb, by the creators of Timestripe.

Part I - Research Context

What does meaningful work mean? The Work and Meaning Inventory (2012) assesses three core components of meaningful work: "1) the degree to which people find their work to have significance and purpose, 2) the contribution work makes to finding broader meaning in life, and 3) the desire and means for



1

one's work to make a positive contribution to the greater good (Steger, M., Dik, B., & Duffy, R.,2012, p. 3-4).

Contrary to popular belief, meaningful work can be anything. This can range from mowing your lawn, to creating an operatic symphony. Every and any in-between activity or hobby can be meaningful and satisfactory. Ian Bogost (2016), game developer, proposes that play is a necessity to translate activity into meaningful work (Bogost, p. 2018). He states by adopting, inventing, constructing, and reconfiguring the material and conceptual limits, we can fashion novelty (enjoyment) from anything (Bogost, I., 2016, p. 223). "The task of the craftsman is not to generate the meaning, but rather to cultivate in himself the skill for discerning the meanings that are already there. (Bogost, I., 2016, p. 223)" By doing so, we can "construct a life in which we take the world around us more seriously by paying greater attention to its' contents. (Bogost, I., 2016, p. 224)." While Bogost argues that we cannot, play transforms our work into an experience which translates meaning and focused attention.

Flow and Meaningful Work Flow theory, developed by hungarian psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, is the psychological concept of the optimal state of consciousness. Much like Bogost's process of Play, Flow generates high focus and attentiveness to a task at hand, which is also known as "the deep now"(Kotler, 2014, p. 105). Csikszentmihalyi coined the term "flow" to describe when an individual operates at full capacity (cf. de Charms, 1968; Deci, 1975; White, 1959).

Csikszentmihalyi argues that our contemporary distinction between work and play is misleading (Butler, N., Olaison, Lena., Sliwa, M., Meier, Sørensen B & Spoelstra, S., 2011, p. 331):

"the essential difference is not between `play' and `work' as culturally defined activities but between the `flow' experience (which typically occurs in play activities but may be present in work as well) and the experience of anxiety and boredom (which may occur in any time and place but is more likely in activities that provide either too few or too many opportunities of action). (Csikszentmihalyi, 2000, p. 185)."

For both Csikszentmihalyi and Bogost, work, play, and flow are closer in relation than what is conventionally assumed.

Csikszentmihalyi studied the conditions of enjoyment for artists and athletes to determine the reason for pursuing their activities. Additionally, he and his colleagues also studied work, specifically surgery, where extrinsic rewards such as wealth are guaranteed. When forming characteristics of optimal experience, their findings reported a similar phenomenology across play and work settings ( Snyder, C., Lopez S., 2002. P. 89).

Flow is determined through the subjective construction of experience. "It is the perceived balance of challenges (or opportunities for action) and skills (abilities to deal with the situation). When individuals perceive greater opportunities for action than they encounter on average in their daily lives, and have skills adequate to engage them. The activity itself is not important, but how that activity is perceived (Nakamura & Csikszentmihalyi, 2014, p. 95)." David Kotler (2014), author and educator on flow states writes, "It is a transformation available 
3

to anyone, anywhere, provided that certain initial conditions are met. (p. viii)." Flow state is mindstate which can be generated from any activity, as long as certain phenomenological traits are perceived by an individual or group.

Conditions of flow include:  Perceived challenges, or opportunities for action, that stretch  Clear proximal goals and immediate feedback about the progress that is being made Characteristics of flow include:  Intense and focused concentration on what one is doing in the present moment  Merging of action and awareness  Loss of reflective self-consciousness (i.e., loss of awareness of oneself as a social actor)  A sense that one can control one's actions; that is, a sense that one can in principle deal with the situation because one knows how to respond to whatever happens next  Distortion of temporal experience (time has passed faster than normal)  Experience of the activity as intrinsically rewarding, end goal an excuse for the process Being able to access this flow state is highly beneficial, because it fosters growth, and is intrinsically rewarding. A flow activity provides a set of challenges or opportunities for action as well as a system of graded challenges, able to accommodate a person's continued and deepening enjoyment as their skills grow (Nakamura & Csikszentmihalyi, 2014, p. 92).

How to Harness flow



4

Experience is subjective. In order for attention to become completely absorbed in the activity to maintain flow: 1) clear proximal goals, 2) immediate feedback, and 3) just-manageable levels must be challenging in a unified and coordinated way (challenge/skill ratio) (Nakamura & Csikszentmihalyi, 2014, pg 91).

Fig. 1. Challenge/Skill ratio chart for Flow This is a current model of the flow state adapted from Csikszentmihalyi (Nakamura & Csikszentmihalyi, 2014, 1991). Flow is achieved when the perceived challenge and skill are engaging and above the individual's average levels.

When experiencing anxiety or boredom, we are pressed to adjust our level of skill and/ or challenge in order to escape the aversive state and re-enter flow (Csikszentmihalyi, ).

Experiencing either being bored or anxiety is an invitation to find our flow.

Autotelic Personality From the beginning of Flow and intrinsic motivation research, Csikszentmihalyi (1997) described the autotelic personality, "a person who tends to enjoy life or "generally does things for their own sake, rather than in order to achieve some later external goal (p. 117)" In a study of American teenagers, Autotelic students, measured by time in flow, had positive connections. Their future goals were more well-defined, they had more positive cognitive affective states, and found apathy to be the most unsatisfactory (Adlai-Gail (1994). The goal is to run my platform in an autotelic framework. While personalities are different, the characteristics of behaviour found in an autotelic personality show universally positive outcomes. "Autotelic persons are attracted to goals that require effort to achieve; those who prefer relaxation are not. How does such a difference become habitual? The data suggest that the two strategies may be equally positive in the short term but that children who learn to enjoy investing effort in meaningful goals can count on more positive outcomes in the long run, compared with children who learn to enjoy less demanding goals (Nakamura & Csikszentmihalyi, 2014, p. 101)." If I were to presume that my platform could create an autotelic framework, it would be from my platform's ability to increase attention and awareness to work being produced, more specifically work already being fashioned from an intrinsic standpoint.

Play Ian Bogost (2016) defines play as "free movement within a more rigid structure (Bogost, p. 94). He states that play is not diversion from work as we know it, but a name for the feeling of



6

making something work, as a result of interacting with its materials. Essentially, doing what you can, with materials you find along the way (Bogost, p. 94). A key to play is "reverence." Play is not imposing by your own will, but seeing the world for the materials it has, and how we can discover it (Bogost, p. 224). Much like Csikszentmihalyi inquiry into boredom and anxiety as being prerequisites to enter into a flow state, the process of play (for the outcome of fun), and how play can facilitate a meaningful interaction with found objects is similar.

How Being Bored Encourages Play As philosopher and cultural critic Walter Benjamin (1999) observes, "we are bored when we don't know what we are waiting for (p. 105)". Boredom thus contains a sense of anticipation, even promise: `Boredom is the threshold to great deeds' (Benjamin.). Boredom reminds us of the paucity of the present and holds open the prospect of an as-yet undetermined future, and is thus resolutely utopian in its orientation (citation). This creates a type of timeless space where your perception of time is overlooked. Bogost (2016) echoes this by stating "Joy and pleasure live beyond boredom. Under it, not before, not a top it. we must first strip away all the chaff of familiarity... in order to face it for what it truly is" (p. 74). Boring also means drilling into something, as if to find its centre. (Wallace, 2012, p. 136). When we distract our boredom with novelty, instead of embracing and confronting our boredom, we do not find the true meaning of work and play. Boredom helps us to define the present, and pay more attention to materials (people, places, and objects) that we may find. Boredom creates a true sense of play that does not rely on novelty that is commonly found in current day social platforms. This will be discussed further in Part II.



7

Chunking and Meaning Both Flow and Play produce meaningful work by their ability to re-orient our focus to the present. In doing so, we have higher pattern recognition and lateral thinking. Steven Kotler (2014) states, "when the pattern recognition system correctly identifies a pattern, it's stored not as a series of steps, rather as a whole - a chunk: "We're using the conscious mind to identify patterns, then repeating those patterns enough times that they become chunks."" Chunking is effective in meaningful work because it gives the ability to learn through the "bigger picture." Bits of information are united together through various connections of memory and ideas, leading to a higher experiential form of learning and creativity (Oakley, B., 2016).

Part II - Implementing Research into an Online Platform

Chunk the Platform My project is proposing further research and development into creating platforms to cultivate higher autotelic behaviour, characteristics of play, and "chunking" in online use. By doing so, I propose a higher sense of meaningful work and online time for users. Currently, popular social networking sites continue to consume larger amounts of users' attention. A recent study has shown that U.S teenagers spend an average amount of 9 hours a day online for entertainment (Wallace, 2015). This has been shown to cause information overload, and can hinder flow and concentration (Wallace, 2015). In the current state of social media, technology is not optimized to benefit time and productivity, but it creates an unregulated schedule for your attention. Social technology



8

designs a pull to visit YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter for just a few minutes, only to keep you still tapping and scrolling an hour later, states Nir Eyal, author of Hooked: How to Build HabitForming Products (Lewis, P., 2017). The designers of these platforms had the clear intention of retaining your attention (Lewis, P., 2017). From Csikszentmihalyi's research, attentional processes shape a person's experience. "What to pay attention to, how intensely and for how long, are choices that will determine the content of consciousness, and therefore the experiential information available to the organism. Thus, William James was right in claiming, `My experience is what I agree to attend to. Only those items which I notice shape my mind' " (Csikszentmihalyi, 1978, p. 339). In our current online system, we are inundated with the amount of information asking for our attention, and there still isn't a platform to increase mindfulness to attention and flow. The choices made are critical because attention is finite, limiting the amount of information that can be processed in consciousness (Csikszentmihalyi & Csikszentmihalyi, 1988). This information is the medium of exchange between person and environment, as well as the material out of which the self is formed (Nakamura & Csikszentmihalyi, 2014, p. 89).

I am proposing on creating a platform which emphasizes the autotelic nature of "working for the sake of work," the nature of "play," and the meaning-making found within chunking.

Fig 1. In the initial planning phase, I mapped out how ideas of Flow, Play, and "Chunking" could be designed and implemented into an online environment

I call it the LinkedIn of "passion projects." This is for all your other work that isn't necessarily for business. In order to achieve this, I have to implement certain characteristics found within "flow," "play," and "Chunking." (Fig. 2 Below) into an online environment. Key characteristics for flow include clear goals, immediate feedback, and a balanced skill to challenge ratio. For play, there must be limits, and diverse materials (people, ideas, objects). For chunking, simplified bits of information which can hold complexity. The process of creativity is a common trigger and/or result of all three.

Figure 2. Flow, Play, Creativity and Chunking Trait Connector

"Flow follows focus," and each activity will be arranged in their own chunk project. In order to build an architecture which is more specific to the activity itself and not the user, chunk projects can be connected to other chunk projects directly, without having to connect to a profile. By doing so, connections have a clearer goal and a closer proximity to collaborative meaning. Each chunk, will have its own objective, a place for immediate feedback, and the ability to connect with collaborators of any sort. Eventually, each chunk project of an individual user will gain different chunk collaborators and idea insights. This will theoretically highlight the process of play, through a mixing of various material potentials (people, images, ideas), which will output creativity, meaningful work, and pattern recognition found in "chunking."



11

For my initial prototype, chunk, I compare it to the online platform "Linkedin." Linkedin focuses primarily on career insights and career networking for users. While these activities can be highly meaningful and intrinsically motivated, the focus of Linkedin is used for extrinsic goal orientation: financial and career motives. My platform will take another approach to users, by letting them specify activity insights of any nature. These activities do not have to be career related, but simply are activities which are enjoyed and want to be pursued further by the user.

In order to orient goals into flow theory, goals must be intrinsically motivated, as opposed to extrinsic motivation. Csikszentmihalyi and Jeanne Nakamura are clear that extrinsic motivations shift to the self and its shortcomings, creating a self-consciousness that impedes engagement of the challenges (Nakamura & Csikszentmihalyi, 2014, p. 92). In order to maintain an intrinsically motivated atmosphere, I must facilitate a platform which gives clear proximal goals, immediate feedback, and just-manageable levels of challenge orientation. By facilitating an environment which fosters intrinsic motivation, I hope to create an atmosphere which will encourage filtered and relevant information for the user.

Structure - Autotelic Persona Possible strategies for my platform to assume an Autotelic Persona:  People self-define the projects they are involved in: Flow is not achieved from an objective activity, but the subjective awareness of any activity. Having a person describe and display their projects in their own terms will hopefully promote an inherent bias of self-motivation.



12

 A democratized format to show projects and get feedback to everyone in a network The idea, is that everyone will have projects at different stages, and each user will not feel the pressure of showing only completed work, or feeling hesitant to ask for feedback.

When users make a profile, they are logged into a home page chunk which displays their projects, shows specific highlights that they have chosen, and the collaborators which have been accepted for that page (fig 1). If a chunk project, such as the visual art chunk (fig 2), is selected, the user is then brought to a project chunk, which contains more specific work under the "visual art" bracket. Collaborators can connect to the "visual art" chunk specifically, without having to connect to the home chunk or other project chunks. By allowing new projects to be "chunked" into an existing chunk project, the topics become more limited, but still open enough for new meaning. By allowing different collaborators to connect with a specific chunk project, I am proposing that a users networks will become more specific and intrinsically organized to pay greater attention to their work. Bogost (2016) proposes, "there is a humility in limitation, for it requires us to treat things as they are rather than as we wish them to be. Such a shift is required if we hope to escape the tyranny of restraint in order to construct a life in which we take the world around us more seriously by paying greater attention to its contents" (p. 236). By orienting a chunk project towards more limitation within a topic and network, greater attention can occur on the user's topic itself, leading to a higher sense of meaningful work (p. 236).

I propose that goal orientation will follow the balance between limitation and discovery given by a chunk project. There is a combination between a set primary idea, but also the ability to gain perceptive challenges through a collaborative network, greater than ourselves. I challenge that the ratio between limitation and discovery is ideal for combining abstract or similar ideas together. There is the connecting of novel new ideas with older ones, which parallels the creative process, and how we can attune our intrinsic values.



15

Within the context of how one's conscious processes,"the self becomes organized around goals. Kotler (2014) states in his book, If creating more flow is our aim, then the emphasis falls on "clear" and not "goals." Clarity leads to certainty. When we know what to do and where to focus attention, "metacognition" replaces with "in-the-moment" cognition, diminishing the sense of self that is prone to distraction (p. 115). In the process of creating chunks, we are creating bite-size views of a larger picture of what we enjoy, giving more clarity to how and what we define our time with.

When your collaborator updates their chunk project, makes their chunk project a live feed, or creates a new project, notifications are shown on your chunk project which is connected with them (see fig 1,2). General notifications are highlighted in yellow, and live chunks are highlighted in blue. By implementing a live feature in a chunk projects, alongside chunk updates, a user can document in-the-moment news (similar to a twitter feed) (see fig 2) within a set topic of discussion. By doing so, I am encouraging immediate feedback, and sense of "co-flow." Immediate feedback allows the needed information to be processed quickly by not having the conscious mind get involved, while keeping the user's attention (Kotler, S., 2014, p.115). A present nature is needed in order to resume a meaningful experience of work. This is also highlighted by the process of play as work. Heidegger proposes that objects in the world can be seen in two, the "presence-at-hand" or the "readiness-to-hand." "Ready-to-hand is when an object is put it to use, taking advantage of it for some end (a hammer used to hit nails), and something is present-at-hand and when it is held at a distance and revealed to be more than we'd previously thought possible (the hammer used to hold down a balloon). By creating an immediate experience, the "purpose (hammer hitting a nail)" and "nature (hammer can be used



16

to hold a balloon)" of objects become the meaningful experience unto itself. Play makes work into the "experience of oscillating between the potential and actual properties of a set of people, things, events, and ideas outside of us (Bogost, I., 2016, p 79). By identifying a present attitude, we create the presence-at-hand, "the ability to reveal that everything has greater potential than we initially suspect - or than we can ever fully know (Bogost, I., 2016, p 73)." By orienting to a process of play, both the actual and potential of life's moments become a playground to learn and discover.

Part III - Comparisons

Linkedin and Chunk As previously mentioned, I am looking to highlight projects of any nature, aimed to increase attention and engagement with the user. I want personal projects to be pursued further and more intrinsically based than what LinkedIn currently offers. While Linkedin is ideal for networking for career motivations, I am pursuing the malleability of how a career could be more oriented towards personal projects and goals, versus the existing structure of a "work" platform. By chunk creating connections between projects themselves, instead of relying on the profile of the person, your projects gain a higher sense of personal investment. This differs from LinkedIn's standard resume-format of displaying places you've worked and projects you've created. Chunk therefore focuses more on the concept of meaning within personal projects depending on the individual.



17

Behance and Chunk In connection with Adobe, Behance is a great tool for displaying creative work for the creative industry. I am positioning chunk to show that ANYTHING can be creative work, as creativity is fundamental to flow, play, and chunking. At no other point in history, have artistic pursuits been readily able to connect with business and consumerism. Behance puts creative work within a professional mold. I want to influence and discern creativity (creative work) as a meta-skill & tool for meaning, not necessarily work for a creative industry such as graphic design, commercial-art, or ux.

Pinterest and Chunk Pinterest is a visual based platform which lets a user create a "pinboard" out of various images that they find. This is a great platform for meaning-making within the context of found objects. My platform, chunk, takes this further by "pinning" (I call chunking), full projects, people, and ideas together. Also, by allowing a live stream feature, I am creating immediate feedback, which is not present on Pinterest. My projects will always be sourced back to the original project page, while Pinterest abstracts objects from their original source.

Climb and Chunk (https://climb.timestripe.com/) There is a new platform called climb, from the creators of Time Stripe. In "climb," is an app which allows you to set and monitor goals. "Climb transforms the path of achieving your most desirable goals into inspiring stories that motivates you to achieve more and your followers to help you with it (citation)."



18

You can document a step-by-step journey, unite with other people with a similar goal, and also explore other goals. I think that climb is the closest platform to chunk. Both platforms show a sense of goal orientation and intrinsic motivation. I think climb is more oriented towards external motivation, but is great way to document and breakdown the process of a specific goal. Chunk is more oriented towards goals which are achieved through discovery, potentiality and crosspollination. Chunk also allows for the potential of improving a user's work without a specific goal in mind, whereas, for climb, sometimes specific goals can detract a person from achieving them if it is set out as an objective activity.

Conclusion By creating this platform, I want to encourage and promote a change to online behaviour. I want boredom and anxiety to be used as a tool for productivity and meaningful work, not distraction. The noise of digital information will not slow down, and I think it is a key time to promote research and implementation towards flow, processes of play, visual learning, and positive psychology in online spaces. "Chunk" continues the conversation on how information continues to be filtered and focused in our online spaces with others. I also see chunk's architecture as a new way to look at information processing in the future (for example, wikipedia). By having chunks being connected as a network, I see research and resource "chunks" forming, giving quicker and more thorough access into certain subject areas or topics of discourse. By using characteristics of flow, play, and chunk learning, my platform proposes that any work can be meaningful with the right set of characteristics and attributes. Our current online environments and personas do not hold our attention to one thing as a priority, while chunk says to pay attention to flow tasks and stay focused.

Add Edit T.I.S.O.D.D - The Inevitable Spiral of Day Dreams
There is no such thing as blue water, only blue rooms. I use a swimming pool to illustrate a sense of truth to imagery. If an individual is unsettled by the appearance of distorted objects from above the water, the alternative is to live under the water in order to exist with the actual object. Since it's impossible to live underwater, the individual must create their own interpretation of being underwater, no matter how false it may seem.
