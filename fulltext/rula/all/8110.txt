MARKETING A STARTUP TARGETING MILLENNIAL TRAVELLERS Ali Eren Ozcan

Master of Digital Media, Digital Media Ryerson University, 2018

Millennial generation travellers have different behaviors towards advertisements. The purpose of this project is to focus on answering the thesis question: do image-based advertisements including human figure gain more attraction than image-based advertisements that includes graphical, colorful content? For this research, we will create a startup focused on serving millennial travellers. Then, we will conduct a comparison between classic, combined, and graphic advertising styles, using differently created images. The goal of this comparative study is to understand the most effective advertising strategy for a startup geared toward millennial travellers. We tested these advertising strategies on millennial travellers visiting Toronto or currently living in Toronto. Our hypothesis was that millennial travellers will be more interested in an image-based advertisement including humans or human face within travel and tourism advertisements. The results showed that millennial travellers are more interested in an image-based advertisement including humans or human face.

1. Introduction The travel and tourism industry is one of the largest industries in the world. It generated 10.2% of global GDP and 9.6% of global employment in 2016 (World Travel and Tourism Council, 2017). It is larger than the automotive and chemical manufacturing industries (World Travel and Tourism Council, 2017). Therefore, the opportunity to impact the industry and take a small portion of it is extremely valuable. The trending behavior in the tourism industry is experience-based traveling (World Economic Forum, 2017). Experience-based is defined as: "In an experience-based exchange the tourist enters into a multifaceted interaction with the actors and the setting of a narrative staged by the local community. (Stamboulisa & Skayannis, 2003)" In the next five to ten years the experience-seekers will become the industry's core customer base. (World Economic Forum, 2017). This trending behavior is becoming popular within the tech-savvy millennial generation. Millennial travellers, also defined as young travellers, are born between early 1980's and 1990's (World Tourism Organization, 2016). Digital marketing is an important strategy to reaching and analyzing the audiences. It is an umbrella term that includes different concepts underneath and it is becoming an effective way of getting brand exposure. By 2019, in the USA digital marketing budget will grow from 30 to 35 percent which, the total digital marketing costs in 2019 will sum up to 100 billion dollars (Parlov, Perkov, & Sicaja, 2016). In Canada, digital media advertising spending increased and expected to surpass 40% in 2018 (Statistica, 2017). These show that there is a trend for companies in investing to digital marketing and it will keep increasing in the future.

It is important to create advertisements that will match user expectations and foster user satisfaction. Advertisements should have a clear visual, target the right customer segment and create value for customers to achieve engagement (Smith K. T., 2012). Creating the right advertisement on the correct channel and finding the right visual representation requires testing different variables by using A/B testing as the core methodology for digital marketing. Digital marketing targeting to a specific audience needs research on their trends, behaviors and expectations. The millennial generation is one of the distinct examples where they are tech-savvy, enjoy engaging with advertisements and are interested in experience-based travelling compare to other generations. They prefer seeing advertisements that are personal, provide coupons, gifts, free items or that creates value. Digital advertisements targeting millennials requires research and analysis to find the best way to gain traction. Generic behavior towards travel and tourism industry is that image-based digital advertisements that include humans or human face as a subject tends to get more attraction according to research (Park & Kim, 2018) (White, 2010). Moreover, these advertisements get more likes, shares and comments compared to others (Bakhshi, Shamma, & Gilbert, 2014). Currently, literature regarding to millennial traveller behaviors toward the travel and tourism industry advertisements does not specifically focus on comparison tests to provide information. As a generation, they enjoy seeing graphical, colorful content on advertisements (Smith K. T., 2012). In the tourism and travel industry the generic behavior towards digital advertisement is that image-based advertisements which, includes humans or human faces tends to receive more traction. Millennial travellers like different advertisements, we wanted test if they represent their generational behaviors towards advertisements or the generic interest of human image-based advertisement. Detailed research will be done, and A/B comparison tests
2

will be created to develop an outcome. A/B comparison tests will be done between three styles of advertisements according to our research findings and will be explained detailly in the methodology section. 2. Review of Literature 2.1 Millennial Travellers Millennial travellers are defined differently from various distinct sources and mentioned as young travellers in different research articles. According to The World Youth Student and Educational (WYSE) Travel Confederation, travellers who are born between early 1980s and early 2000s, are considered as millennial travellers (World Youth Student and Educational Travel Confederation, 2014). Additionally, the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) refers to millennial travellers as young travellers who are born between early 1980s and early 2000s (World Tourism Organization, 2016). On the other hand, the Canadian Tourism Commission states that millennial travellers, also as young travellers, are the youth born in the 1980s and early 90's (Canadian Tourism Commission, 2015). According to the recent 2018 Pew Research Center report, millennials are those born between 1981 and 1996 (Dimock, 2018), where Ernst and Young also uses the same age period (Ernst & Young, 2015). The definition of millennial generation and the age range is different depending on demographers or various researchers. Based on the relevance of this study and how recent the findings are, this paper will continue under the notion that the target customer segment are millennials aged 22-37 years old. The trending behavior for millennial travellers is to look for experiences such as: an authentic local journey or making a difference in the community by working voluntarily (World Economic Forum, 2017). Currently, every traditional touristic place is much more accessible

3

than before due to the development of the internet (World Economic Forum, 2017). In the next five to ten years, experience-seekers will be the core customer segment for the tourism industry (World Economic Forum, 2017). Therefore, we focused our customer segment to these experience-seekers who, are millennial generation or young travellers, as called in travel industry. Millennial travellers are tech-savvy, independent and play a key role in emergence of a new travel destination (Canadian Tourism Commission, 2015). This thesis will focus on millennial generation in America and Canada therefore, providing information on millennial generation in these countries will be beneficial for the paper. In USA there are 75 million millennials according to a 2017 research which is the 23% of the USA population (Company, 2017). In Canada they are 27.5% which is around 10 million millennials (Neilsen Company, 2018). According to the Statistics Canada report millennials will hold 50% of the Canadian jobs by 2020 (Irwin, 2017). Interestingly same prediction is valid for U.S., by 2020 nearly 50% of workforce will consist of millennials (MRI Network, 2017). It is important to see that connecting with millennial generation will be more important for companies. According to the report from Destination Canada, 56% of the millennials come from US to Canada. US Millennials travelling to Canada spent 30.4% within the all millennials travelling to Canada, where it is around 684 million dollars (Destination Canada, 2016). Focusing on millennial travellers living in Canada or travelling to Canada from US will give enough data to understand their behaviors towards advertisements. 2.2 Tourism Industry and Trends The tourism industry is rapidly evolving with the rise of internet usage around the world. Sharing economy, also known as peer to peer economy, is altering the industry dynamics (Cheng, 2016), affecting the tourist consumption patterns, social and economic attraction of the
4

destinations, period of stay, travel frequency and the variety of activities (Tussyadiah and Pesonen, 2015) . The sharing economy has entered the travel and hospitality industry, giving ways to successful startup businesses offering peer-to-peer accommodation and transportation such as Airbnb and Uber (Tussyadiah and Pesonen, 2015). Airbnb provides a digital marketplace for hosts to share their house and visitors to pay and stay at their house. Uber provides a mobile application for people to share their car and drive other people to earn money. They are both included in experience-based tourism and people love to share, provide comments and use these platforms. Additionally, sharing economy companies focusing on food such as Eatwith and Vizeat followed up with the trend, allowing locals to prepare meals to visitors in their homes or at a restaurant. There are also other sharing economy companies such as Withlocals, Airbnb Experiences and more that focuses on locals' creating their favourite itineraries as guided tours and take visitors on them for a fee. In this digital period, travel agencies are considered as "old school" and tourists are searching for new ways of experiencing travelling. Tourists understand their needs better while travelling. with access to the market knowledge. Therefore, they are making more specific purchase decisions (Sigala, 2014). These decisions led millennial generation to construct their own journeys. According to Airbnb survey, millennials tend to create their own itineraries when travelling rather than a packaged tour (Airbnb, 2016). This also shows the millennials potential to generate new experiences. Millennial tourists have distinct behaviors which will affect the future of tourism industry. Firstly, they tend to skip on travel and accommodation spending's (Elena Cavagnaro, Simona Staffieri, Albert Postma, 2018) where, sharing economy companies like Airbnb and Uber, or metasearch websites such as Skyscanner, Kayak is playing a crucial role. Millennials
5

more like to spend on things that will create value for them. They spend three times more than an average tourist in a location and this hands in an economic opportunity towards developing touristic points (Elena Cavagnaro, Simona Staffieri, Albert Postma, 2018). Secondly, this travelling behavior of millennials are also initiating new economic approaches to enhance tourism to wider societies (Elena Cavagnaro, Simona Staffieri, Albert Postma, 2018). Creating new opportunities and increasing the local economic development by seeking new cultural experiences. Finally, millennials are interested in creating a difference in the location by working voluntarily or supporting a cause (World Economic Forum, 2017). Overall, the trend of millennial travellers to seek experiences, value and implement their own decisions for purchases will create more opportunities for travel and tourism industry. Digital marketing is becoming crucial within tourism and travel industry since, travellers are researching a place to visit mostly online or by getting referral from friends and family. They prefer lots of information about a place without reading a vast amount of content (Sihare, 2017). Therefore, image-based marketing of touristic places is becoming an essential (Sihare, 2017). It is important to research and understand what types of digital marketing advertisements targeting millennial travellers are more effective in the industry to gain traction. 2.3 Digital Marketing and Millennials

2.3.1 Digital Marketing In this era, digital marketing is the umbrella term of one of the most crucial advertisement strategies in all industries. It includes social media marketing, email marketing, influencer marketing, online advertisement, SEO and more (Alexander, 2018). Any kind of marketing done using the internet or an electronic device fits under the criteria of digital marketing (Alexander,
6

2018). It is becoming more effective for acquiring new customers, maintain loyal customers, getting engagement or for getting brand exposure. Most importantly digital marketing helps in creating an electronic word of mouth (eWOM) chain over internet. eWOM is the electronic version of word of mouth, including all communications directed to consumers through an internet technology related to goods or services (Pelsmackera, Tilburg, & Holthof, 2018). Historically, the way that route maps were created as a content and distributed with a small logo in the back for drivers, played a huge role of promoting those oil-companies. There were no Google Maps nor a navigational digital system for specifically truck drivers, so all of them got it as a complimentary gift from a gas station and shared within each other. That way they achieved a world of mouth (WOM) marketing by content creation by people sharing with each other which, is a crucial effect on purchase intention of customers (Ashutosh Pandey, Rajendra Sahu, Manoj Kumar Dash, 2018). eWOM is the digital version where instead of physical route maps, consumers and influencers share their suggestions on products and provide their transparent opinion about it. The audience finds influencers as authentic and trustworthy source, they like and share the product with their friends online or through social media which drives a subtle marketing campaign by the customers (Hoven, 2017). These emerging new marketing strategies are important to present the importance level of digital media because they are all parts of human experiences. The priority level of digital marketing could be explained from another perspective with stats. A survey from Facebook states: "94% of people surveyed in the US say they keep a smartphone on hand while watching TV." Even people are still watching and following traditional media, the transition between generational behaviors affects the new marketing focuses. Another survey result says that millennials check their phone 150 times per day
7

(Brandon, 2017). Additionally, another survey from Deloitte depicts that more than 80% of people checks their smart phone within an hour after getting up or before going to bed (Deloitte, 2016). These results from surveys show that people are getting more addicted to their smart phones and the use of internet. If we focus on generations, millennials use social media more than generation X (baby boomers) and higher percentage of millennials owns a smart phone (Jiang, 2018). With this high penetration of internet, digital marketing and targeting millennials with advertisements is a great combination to achieve efficient return on investment (ROI).

2.3.2 Targeting Millennials Digital marketing is a venue, which has been considered the most expectancy to reach millennial generation (Smith K. T., 2012). Therefore, knowing how they behave towards an advertisement is the key to develop valuable results on digital marketing campaigns. Most millennials don't mind seeing advertisements, but they prefer seeing advertisements that will add value to them. According to a study of Adweek, 57% of millennials state they are willing to see sponsored advertisement content from a brand, as long as the brand advertisement is entertaining, beneficial and it has unique personalities (Arnold, 2018). This generation is willing to comment, write reviews, give feedback and share their favorite brands (Smith K. T., 2012). Blogs, podcasts, video generated content has been trending and enjoy interacting with them. The goal of digital marketing in this era is considered as inbound marketing (Smith K. T., 2012) ; focusing on gaining attention of the customers through creating relevant, useful content and add value to their customer journey. A general recommendation from Facebook brand management agencies are:

8

"Campaigns need to invite Millennials into the [ad] process and allow them to get involved with the brand on a deeper level. User-generated ads, Facebook brand pages, Twitter, and a host of new technologies have opened up the doors [to do that]. (Serazio, 2012) " Providing valuable content to millennials will result them to share the information that you are presenting, which will initiate the eWOM chain experience. Millennial generation who, have the highest percentage of smartphone and social media usage. 92% of millennial generation owns smartphone and 85% of them say that they use social media which, they have the highest percentage amongst other generations (Jiang, 2018). Tech savvy millennial tourists have unique touristic behaviors and seek new ways of exploring. They highly value new life experiences (Canadian Tourism Commission, 2015): "Previous studies on millennials state that travel means to them novelty: the possibility to evade the quotidian, to try a different lifestyle, to live new experiences, to visit new places and to acquire new knowledge." (Cavagnaro, 2015). Millennials enjoy using sharing posts on social media. The fast way to test image-based advertisements towards millennials is to use Facebook and Instagram social media platforms. Recent studies state that Facebook and Instagram have the most users who look at image-based posts. Facebook has 6 billion active users who like, comment or share, and Instagram has 3.4 billion active users (Sihare, 2017). Engaging millennials and discovering their interests can be challenging. According to a survey, millennials prefer to see online coupons in advertisements; they prefer graphic images, personalization, bright colors and they engage with the word "free" (Smith K. T., 2012). They also write reviews if they have something to trade and earn as a reward such as competitive pricing, shipping rates, coupons, rewards for loyal customers or free

9

gifts (Smith K. T., 2012). Moreover, this is the way that they engage with the advertisement and initiate an eWOM chain. This research shows that millennials find value in interacting with an advertisement if it is visually satisfying, therefore creating value. These are general characteristics of how millennials perceive advertisements among various industries. These should be similar for the travel and tourism industry but could be more researched by testing on advertisements. A research study from Cavagnaro states that millennial travellers seek experience-based motivations that make an emotional and meaningful impact on their lives: "When interpreting youth tourism, the conceptualization of tourism as an experience is even more important because young travellers reject standard or homogenized products and look for new solutions, ideas, and emotions or, in one-word, new experiences. (Cavagnaro, 2015)" According to an Airbnb survey, millennials tend to create their own itineraries when travelling rather than a packaged tour (Airbnb, 2016). These studies show the motivations that the millennial generation have toward creating new, customized routes. The creation of these routes could be marketed for them to create their own itineraries in order to earn coupons, money, gifts or free items. The research creates a structure for how advertisements are perceived among the millennial generation. Furthermore, research proves that including a product or a person in marketing material has a positive and effective impact on tourism advertisements (Hoven, 2017). Moreover, a research study on Instagram about the effects of face photos shows that, pictures with faces get 38% more likes and 32% more comments (Bakhshi, Shamma, & Gilbert, 2014). However, according to this study, the number of faces, gender or age of the subjects do not play a crucial role. Therefore, in this case including a random human subject should be enough to gain traction. Another research also states that pictures which include humans were more likely to receive a
10

comment compared to a picture with a landscape or landmark without a human (White, 2010). Tourists also like to take photos similar to what they see online or in the advertisements. They prefer the activities they see on advertised travel photos and an analysis of tourists' photos show that they focus on content that illustrates activities and experiences which relates to human subjects (Park & Kim, 2018). Overall, research shows that people are interacting more when there is a human subject in the image. The millennial generation has different behaviors towards advertisements. They are interested in advertisements that have graphical, colorful and personalized content and provides coupons, free items or adds value to them. However, the generic case in the travel and tourism world is that people are more interested in image-based digital advertisements that includes humans or human faces. There studies and researches targeting millennial travellers are not focused on specific searches for digital marketing. This thesis will study to provide information on if the millennial travellers, will be still interested in graphical content in travel and tourism related advertisements rather than seeing human based image. Our hypothesis is that millennial travellers will be more interested in an image-based advertisement including humans or human face within travel and tourism advertisements. This thesis will further research and do a comparative study on millennial travellers with the question: do image-based advertisements including human figure gain more attraction than image-based advertisements that includes graphical, colorful content? The study will provide information about behaviors of the millennial travellers towards travel and tourism digital advertisements.

11

3. Methodology 3.1 Methodology Overview This thesis will aim to answer the following question: Do image-based advertisements including people gain more attraction than image-based advertisements that include graphics and digitally enhanced content? Deciding the right methodology for the comparative test is important for a consistent research and to define a valuable conclusion. First of all, we will create a startup to test our hypothesis, since marketing or advertising existing companies will create bias and copyrights issues. The startup that we are creating solves the unmet need of creating a low-cost option for tourists to experience a local lifestyle. Currently, tourists do not have an affordable option of requesting a route that is specific to their interests when visiting a new city. A practical solution for people who want to explore a place on their own, without a guide, or without having to talk to strangers for safety, language, or comfort related reasons, does not exist. We want travellers to enjoy their own experiences by not following a tour guide, but by following a flexible and interest-based route that will enhance their perspectives. We want to provide an income source to the locals, who will create secret routes of their cities on our platform to change how tourists experience a place; by independently guiding themselves around a new city. To solve these issues and provide solutions, we created the startup and named it Routestr. It is a digital marketplace for hosts and visitors to buy and sell unique, low-cost, curated local routes that will allow users to self-navigate on a navigational map to explore the city like a local. The sharing economy startup Routestr will be the main foundation of the thesis research tests to prove hypothesis.

12

Secondly, we will create a landing page to provide a link for our millennial travellers to engage when clicking the advertisements. This page creation is important since this will be the next step for millennial travellers to sign up for further steps. This page will be designed as simple as possible to just to be consistent with advertisements of the startup. Finally, it is important to choose the right channels to easily access our target customer segment millennials travellers. The decision to choose channels is made by focusing on how to reach and expose our advertisements to millennial travellers fast. Since millennials are also highly tech-savvy, we preferred to use social media channels. Facebook and Instagram channels have advertisement platforms for companies, startups or even for individuals to promote themselves. A study done in 2018 shows that Facebook and Instagram are the most used social media platforms (Aaron Smith, Monica Anderson, 2018). Facebook and Instagram have easy to setup advertisement platforms and provides options for A/B testing on different advertisements. Facebook Ads analytics will be used to analyze our findings and create a detailed result section. Therefore, to test our hypothesis we will use these advertisement platforms to create specific advertisements for A/B testing's. These distinct advertisements will be created under three categories: classic, combined and graphic. The division between these advertisements are will be effective to understand which one gains more attraction and to understand the impact of imagebased human subjected advertisements. Consistency is important to achieve better results with the tests. Therefore, the initial conditions while starting the advertisements will be protected throughout the whole testing period. Optimization, adding or removing an item from website will be done only before the tests. This way the variety of factors affecting the results will be minimized.

13

3.2 Advertisement Styles We will focus on three different styles of advertisement which, is derived according to the research to achieve a detailed result. These will be defined as classic, combined and graphic throughout this thesis. Digital advertisements of a travel photo including humans or face of a human will be defined as "classic". Millennial generation travellers are attracted towards graphical and colorful advertisements. This type of created advertisement will be called "graphic" style and combination of these two advertisements will be called "combined" style. The reason to test combined design is to discover if they are more interested in seeing both of these styles on their advertisements. These advertisements will be created and designed according to the initiated startup. The colors of the advertisements, the concept and the headings will be focusing on getting the attraction for the startup. Since these will be consistent, the power of images will be tested. This thesis will implement A/B testing on these advertisements to test our hypothesis. 3.3 A/B Testing A/B tests are two different advertisements promoted to the same audience: A as the first advertisement, B as the second advertisement. Furthermore, there can be a third advertisement added within tests, since they are all same except one variable and presented to same audience using the same channels. This is still under the concept of A/B testing. These advertisements were created without changing any variable other than the images. They were promoted by Facebook Ads through Facebook and Instagram channels and they are compared to each other by checking their reach and click through rate (CTR). Reach is the number of times when an advertisement has been shown to customers one or more times. This showed that A or B is more successful gaining the reach from the defined customer segment. CTR the rate of people who see
14

the advertisement and click the advertisement which, provided the information of how many people were interested. A/B test materials were created by using Adobe products: Adobe Illustrator CC and Adobe Photoshop CC. These programs are used to add graphics, titles or edit the photo to make it more attractive towards millennials. We used the pictures from a copyright free website: unsplash.com or pictures taken by us. We choose these images according to the resemblance with the initiated startup. The designs and the colors are kept consistent with our startup landing page design and logo design. Facebook marketing researchers state that minimum three days will give the average accurate results for A/B tests. In this thesis case, we promoted each A/B testing or advertisement for four days to get more accurate results. The tests were studied in America and Canada. The reason for choosing both is that the startup focuses on travellers travelling to Canada or people who lives in Canada. The tests also had specific target groups to achieve a precise target audience. These groups were people interested in travel and leisure, people match with Airbnb, Lonely Planet, TripAdvisor, Booking.com and have behavior of frequent travelling. The advertisements targeted the audience millennials travellers who are defined as 22-37 years old. 4.Results and Discussion Overall, we designed three different types of images to test on advertisements: classic, combined and graphic (see Appendix A). We created and published nine image-based advertisements on Facebook and Instagram social media platforms in two months. At the end of each A/B tests, we analyzed the data and created the new advertisement to test new creative concepts. In two months, we spend more than a hundred dollars on our advertisements campaigns, we found an interesting outcome that supports our hypothesis.

15

Our customer segment, 22-37 years old millennial travellers, reacted to our promoted A/B tests and in total, we received 43.084 number of reach (see Table 1). From this amount of reach we achieved 37 clicks on the advertisement links which, directs to the Routestr landing page (see Table 1). Our CTR was overall 0.086%. According to a report from WordStream, average industry CTR is 0.90% and travel and tourism industry CTR is also 0.90% (Irvine, 2018). Our CTR results were low and our analysis depicts that this could be due to distinct variables such as choice of image and graphics. The overall outcome is that tests should be run for a longer period to optimization of graphics and images. Moreover, this CTR result does not affect the general aim of the thesis but this finding show that our combination of advertisements for our startup were not successful towards our customer segment. We used the data to discover different findings such as: What range of age is more interested in them? Which platforms are mostly used to click the advertisements? These results will provide supporting findings for our thesis conclusion.
Platform Desktop Facebook Feed Mobile Facebook Facebook Messenger Feed Instant Article Instagram Feed Instagram Stories Grand Total Reach 191 191 191 42893 25724 21778 3495 451 12169 2086 15083 43084 Clicks 0 0 0 37 23 19 4 0 14 1 13 37 CTR % 0.086 0.089 0.087 0.114 0.115 0.048 0.086 0.086

Table 1 Reach and Clicks by Ad Platform

In table 1 we can see that the most reach and clicks from millennial travellers came from mobile devices where desktop only 1.33% of reach. More specifically, Facebook Messenger Inbox advertisement and Instagram Story placements were the sections that received most attention.

Figure 1 Number of Total Clicks by Age

Another finding was about the age distribution in the range of 22-37. In Figure 1 we can see that the small range of 22-24 years old millennial travellers are the most engaged segment to be our early adopter. They have 0.093% CTR average on platforms, higher than 25-34 0.055% and 35-37 0.027%. According to the data, the reach is higher in 25-34 category but even though more people has seen more than one we can confirm that 22-24 years old millennial travellers are more engaged with the advertisements with higher CTR. 25-34 comes next and for 35-37 age range we see that only 1 person clicked on our advertisements.

17

Main research towards the hypothesis results were satisfying. Our hypothesis which, will millennial travellers be more interested in an image-based advertisement including humans or human face within travel and tourism advertisements, is proved right with our methodology. In Figure 2, we can see that the data from advertisements show classic style advertisement variations had more clicks than all the other A/B test variations. We can understand that through these 9 A/B tests, we see that millennial travellers are engaging more with the classics style advertisement which, was the advertisement including humans or human faces as a subject. Another great finding is that the combined style test resulted second where it proved that humans or human faces have a crucial role in choosing the right way to attract millennial travellers. Even though graphic was close, it had the less amount of attraction compared to others. Overall the highest reach was in combined style but that shows that classic style, even though had a little less reach compared to other styles.

5.Conclusion The purpose of this project was to focus on answering the thesis question: do imagebased advertisements including human figure gain more attraction than image-based advertisements that includes graphical, colorful content? Our hypothesis is that millennial travellers will be more interested in an image-based advertisement including humans or human face within travel and tourism advertisements. The generated results show that millennial travellers have a tendency towards an image-based advertisement including humans or human face rather than their generational behavior of being interested in graphical, colorful image. The thesis results show that the most reaction to the advertisements came from 22-24 years old millennials. Additionally, millennial travellers engaged with the advertisements through mobile devices rather than desktop. The advertisements are created and designed according to the initiated startup. The details, logo, and overall concepts of the advertisements are related to it. Even though these were kept consistent throughout the A/B tests, they could be affecting the overall results.
