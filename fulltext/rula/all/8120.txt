ABSTRACT The purpose of this Masters Research Paper is to analyze the methods of crisis communication utilized by H&M and Dolce & Gabbana in response to their racially charged ads launched in January 2018 and November 2018 respectively. After thorough research, it is clear that many retail groups have suffered irreparable damage to their images from a crisis (Liu et al., 2011). Image Restoration Theory (IRT) and the Social-mediated Crisis Communication model will act as a lens through which the companies' techniques will be examined. The Literature Review aiding the research gathered in this paper will provide insight into the growth of the advertising industry, examples of modern corporate crises, and a recap of each corporation's controversial pasts. The review will also cover theories of crisis communication and social media's role in crisis communication. After manually collecting data from Dolce & Gabbana's Instagram and Twitter accounts, it is clear that the Italian fashion house misused denial in combination with William Benoit's other strategies within IRT. The public swiftly accused Dolce & Gabbana of lying and avoiding blame. After Dolce & Gabbana turned to mortification, their image had been damaged as many users labeled the apology as insincere. Similarly, the data collected on H&M reveals that the retail group attempted to evade responsibility. Later, H&M retracted their statement and released an apologized. The apology received a marginally warmer reception by Instagram users, where as many users on Twitter were demonstrably skeptical of its genuineness. When corrective action is employed the public recalls each company's racist past. After thorough analysis, it is evident that in racially charged corporate crises it may be in the best interest of the company's image to take full responsibility for the act and release a denial free apology.

Introduction In a society driven by information overload and ubiquitous surveillance, everything a corporation does is open to hypercriticism through the media (Zheng, Liu, & Davison, 2018). When a corporation is careless or racially-insensitive in the advertisement production process this will result in a controversial final product which can bring about a racially charged crisis. This masters research paper will focus on two case studies in which H&M and Dolce & Gabbana manage high profile racially charged crises centered around advertising. Past advertisements accused of racism will provide a historical framework of the crisis type in question. One trend is that the public will accuse advertisements with racist undertones as being `tone deaf1' which may result in a high volume of media coverage. These accusations threaten the integrity of a corporation's reputation in the eyes of the public (Zheng, Liu, & Davison, 2018). It is crucial for corporations to take ownership of past mistakes and prevent the future production of racists advertisements in order to maintain and protect their image. As both corporations are being charged with accusations of racism, it is important to understand the root of the issue at hand. The root of racism is an "ideology of racial domination" (Wilson, pg. 14, 1999). Race, at its core, is understood as a biological classification of the human species (Clair and Denis, 2015). However, as colonialism and slavery grew in the west, race was utilized to rationalize exploitation, domination, and inflict violence against those considered anything other than white (Fiske, 2010). The scientific agreement is that race is not an organic category amongst humans as genetic distinctions are greater within each race (Cornell, and Hartmann, 2006). Race is a social construct shaped and manipulated by the state and other powers (Clair and Denis, 2015). Social racism is constructed by social actors demonstrating

1

To be tone deaf is when one is unable to tell that their actions or words are racist. 1

overt prejudicial beliefs or attitudes towards a race. To be racially tone-deaf is to ignore less overt markers of racism (Clair and Denis, 2015). Other corporations such as Dove, Gucci, American Apparel and more have been accused of running insensitive advertisements carrying racist undercurrents. One of the two advertisements being analyzed was released by H&M, a high street retail store originally named Hennes when it first opened in Stockholm in 1947 (The H&M group). The advertisement which came under fire appeared on the company's retail website January 8th, 2018, depicted a young African American boy in a green hoodie reading "Coolest Monkey in the Jungle." The image received immediate backlash from the public and made press headlines the very same day (West, 2018). The second ad being unpacked is a part of a campaign released Dolce & Gabbana in November of 2018 and features Chinese model Zuo Ye struggling to eat Italian food with chopsticks (CBC, 2019). These ads are only two of many times the Swedish corporation and Italian fashion house, Dolce & Gabbana, have been scrutinized for controversial and racist campaigns or remarks (Gulf News, 2018). The management of these cases against the backdrop of the brands' controversial history will be analyzed based on William Benoit's (2014) image restoration theory. This theory highlights several methods for restoring an entity's reputation under attack. The social-mediated crisis communication model will also act as a theory through which the corporations' actions can be identified as successful or not in repairing the company's image. As cultural appropriation, accidental racism, and racial tone deafness continue to appear in corporate campaigns, print ads, and commercials it is necessary for corporations to understand the appropriate methods through which to manage racially charged crises. As corporations can now be held responsible by the public for their actions through social media, companies must

2

protect their image while simultaneously appeasing the public and regaining their trust. William Benoit (1997) provides a clear understanding of image restoration theory through which to analyze the various methods of crisis communication present in these case studies. Brooke Fisher Liu, Lucinda Austin, and Yan Jin (2011) use the social-mediated crisis communication model, as a framework to identify how effectively social media was used in each case study to resolve the crisis and address the issue of social responsibility. Zhang and Borden (2017) focus on the ability for the public to call large corporations to take action and accept social responsibility. Additionally, Zheng, Liu, and Davidson (2018) explore corporate crisis communication and advertising from the perspective of stakeholders on social media. These sources, among others, offer central information that this research paper will employ in order to analyze the case studies and answer the research questions which ask; What strategies of crisis communication did the corporations use? How did these methods affect their images? And, how was social media used during the management of these crises?

Literature Review Introduction This literature review outlines a brief history of racist advertising and racially charged crisis communications in order to illuminate the history behind the case studies being analyzed. Dolce & Gabbana and H&M's controversial past will also be explored. Literature on the existing relationship between social media and corporate communication is also reviewed in order to evaluate Dolce & Gabbana's and H&M's use of these tools during the advertising related crises, which took place in January and November of 2018. William Benoit's crisis communication theory called Image Restoration Theory (IRT) will be presented as well. IRT will be the theory through which the raw data collected from Twitter and Instagram will be analyzed. As well, IRT theory outlines the categories through which one of the two codebooks will be based on. Literature dissecting The Social-Mediated Crisis Communication Model is also included, as this model will be the foundation through which Dolce & Gabbana's and H&M's social posts will be evaluated.

A Historical Review of Racism in Advertising A History of Racism in Advertising Edward Bernays, considered the father of public relations, published his techniques regarding manipulating public opinion in 1928 (Tye, 1998). Today, what Bernays pioneered may be acknowledged as a form of branding. But, at its core it is the earliest form of image restoration through which aspects of crisis communications theories are visible. Its underlying purpose is to manipulate or maintain the public's support regarding certain beliefs or ideologies (Tye, 1998).

According to Edward Lama Wonkeryor, author of "Dimensions of Racism in Advertising: From Slavery to the Twenty-First Century," advertising has contained a racial element from slavery to today (Wonkeryor, 2015). From its creation, the leading directive of advertising has been to advertise to those who have the means to buy (Wonkeryor, 2015). In the past in the United States, this concept was limited to the mainstream consumer population which was made up of predominantly white Americans (Wonkeryor, 2015). Non-white members of society were disregarded since the commercial advertising industry viewed them as economically incapable of purchasing the items advertised (Wonkeryor, 2015). However, after World War Two non-whites, most significantly African Americans, gained significant purchasing power and in the mid-20th century advertising agencies began extending campaigns to beyond Caucasians to include other racial and ethnic groups. These groups included Latin Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanics (Wonkeryor, 2015). During much of the 19th and 20th century, ad agencies were controlled by those with mainstream values who disapproved of representing non-whites in a positive light, resulting in the marketing of racist stereotypical identities (Wonkeryor, 2015). The change in marketing that moved away from the use of these stereotypical images was based on the notion that venders needed to connect with non-whites to expand their consumer reach (Wonkeryor, 2015). Jeanette Date and William Barlow further explore how this connections were formulated through communication. Dates and Barlow explain that advertising is a two-way form of communication by stating that "to advertise to people ready; willing and able to buy; to use the media which reach them: and to make advertisement that would win their business" (Wonkeryor, 2015, p 3). Wonkeryor further expresses that the message must both be sent and received as intended as the audience must willingly `buy into' the desired message. Wonkeryor along with Marin and

5

Blumer states that advertising can often have intended underlying messages of social status such as racism as an "ideology of racial domination based on beliefs that a designated racial group is either biologically or culturally inferior can rationalize or prescribe the racial group's treatment in society" (Wonkeryor, 2015, p 4). Since European colonization of the United States, advertising was manipulated by the ruling class to disseminate images upholding their elite status while demeaning that of others. Images of non-white savages and runaway slaves dehumanized these members of society. In 1870, African Americans began to receive reoccurring roles in advertisements when colour lithography2 became available. Most commonly, African American characters were featured on trading cards for sports or jokes. These characters included the puckaninny, blacky mammy, and black sambo. According to Marilyn Kern-Foxworth, "the use of black in pejorative and stereotypical advertising kept them emotionally bound to the idiosyncratic whims of their former masters" Wonkeryor, 2015, p 7). By the 1930s, African Americans became mascots for products made by companies like Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben. Non-whites were depicted as unintelligent, disgusting, subservient, and ignorant which formulated a `black identity' for public consumption (Wonkeryor, 2015). Though, Hall suggests that identities are only temporary attachments to a subject constructed by discursive practices (Boulton, 2012). Hall turns to Roland Barthes' 1967 analysis of an advertisement for Panzani pasta to demonstrate the flexible nature of an identity (Boulton, 2012). Barthes argued that the representation, which was the image of a bag spilling pasta with cheese and vegetables carried denotative 3and connotative 4meanings (Boulton, 2012). The ad invites the public to engage in

Colour Lithography is a process that allowed publishers to print higher quality images at a cheaper price (Wonkeryor, 2015, p 4). 3 Denotative meaning is the literal message attached to the representation. 4 Connotative meaning is the referential meaning linked to the representation. 6

the process of identification by calling on past references in order to understand the advertisement's representation (Boulton, 2012). Advertisements speak to the public through representations of recognizable worlds, but Hall notes that this may not prevent individuals from negotiation or oppositional decoding of the intended message (Boulton, 2012). Lee Dyer goes on to explore how messaged labels, such as "the other," were manipulated by the elite to maintain their power. Dyer suggests that the identity of "the other," made to represent non-whites was used to gain control through articulating white superiority and class privilege (Boulton, 2012). Following Karl Marx's influence, Dyer suggests that the dissemination of these unappealing non-white identities by the ruling class allowed the ruling class to maintain ideological, social, and capital dominance. Marxist ideology can be seen present in today's current structure of the advertising industry (Boulton, 2012). Christopher Boulton, the Author of "Rebranding Diversity: Colorblind racism inside the U.S advertising industry, points to the Mad Men 5holiday cards as an ironic depiction of the current climate. In 2008, advertising agencies pulled on the popular television show's opening credits and replaced the names with their own executives'. According to Boulton, the spoof of this post card (See figure 1) intended as a tribute to the past, presents a fairly accurate picture of modern ad agencies (Boulton, 2012). Mad Men's creator, Matthew Weiner, says that the show's racial representation is accurate to the times, but is still reflective of agencies today.

Mad Men is a television show created by Matther Weiner, which is set in New York in the 1960s and focuses on an ad agency and primarily the white men who run it. The term "mad men" is also rumored to have been a term coined in the 1950s to refer to the advertisers in the business (AMC). 7

Figure 1: Mad Men Post Card Spoof Wonkeryor believes that North American mass media only began to echo the nation's diverse population in the 1990s after much lobbying and hard work from groups for more positive representation. These groups included both ethnicities and religions such as Judaism, American Arabs, Latinos, Asian Americans, African Americans, and more.

Modern Cases of Racialized Campaigns Modern case studies of large corporations with racially charged advertisements provide a small picture of the advertising world today. These case studies help to frame the cases surrounding H&M and Dolce & Gabbana as they provide example of Benoit's strategies used both successfully and unsuccessfully. Comparing and contrasting these past cases alongside the

8

two being researched may reveal certain patterns within the advertising industry or within consumers' reactions. In 2017, Pepsi released an advertisement entitled "Live for Now" that co-opts the images of a black lives matter protest (Watters, 2017). The commercial follows supermodel Kendal Jenner as she marches through the streets seemingly protesting nothing and ends the protest by offering a can of Pepsi to a police officer (Watters, 2017). The controversial ad was pulled of the air fairly quickly after the negative public reaction. Pepsi was accused by the public of mocking the Black Lives Matter movement (Watters, 2017). The final scene mimics the imagery of a 2016 protest against police brutality in Baton Rouge (Watters, 2017). Kendall Jenner attempted to shift her blame for her participation in the commercial entirely onto Pepsi (Suggs, 2017). A few months later, Kendall released an official apology, an act of mortification, and accepted responsibility for her own actions on an episode of the reality television show "Keeping Up with the Kardashians." Pepsi jumped to defend its ad saying it depicted "people from different walks of life coming together in a spirit of harmony" (Watters, 2017). However, less than 24 hours later, on April 5, 2017 Pepsi released an apologetic Tweet: "Pepsi was trying to project a global message of unity, peace and understanding. Clearly, we missed the mark and apologize. We did not intend to make light of any serious issues. We are removing the content and halting any further rollout. We also apologize for putting Kendal Jenner in this position" (Watters, 2017). In early 2019, a sweater was advertised on Gucci's website that resembled blackface
6

(O'kane, 2019). The turtle neck sweater was displayed pulled up over a Caucasian woman's

face, covering her nose, mouth, and chin with the mouth of the sweater outlines in red (O'kane,

6

Blackface is a term that refers to theatrical makeup worn by non-black performers in the 19th century to play caricatures to mock enslaved Africans. Blackface invokes a racist and painful history (Kaur, 2019). 9

2019). The fashion house received an immediate backlash in Twitter and was forced to remove the product from its site. On February 6, 2019 Gucci tweeted "Gucci deeply apologizes for the offense caused by the wool balaclava jumper. We can confirm that the item has been immediately removed from our online store and all physical stores. We consider diversity to be a fundamental value to be fully upheld, respected, and at the forefront of every decision we make. We are fully committed to increasing diversity throughout our organization and turning this incident into a powerful learning moment for the Gucci team and beyond" (O'kane, 2019).

Dolce & Gabanna's Controversial Past Dolce & Gabbana, the Italian fashion house run by Stefano Gabbana and Dominico Dolce, is no stranger to controversy. Many instances in the company's past demonstrate a misuse of crisis communication, especially on social media, which resulted in a damaged image. In a 2015 interview, the two designers, who both openly identify as gay, called children born through IVF "synthetic" (Mower, 2017). British singer Elton John took to Instagram in a post writing "How dare you refer to my beautiful children as `synthetic'....and shame on you.....#BoycottDolce&Gabbana" (Mower, 2017). In 2018, Gabbana left a comment on an Instagram post of Selena Gomez, which translates to "She's really ugly" (Delbyck, 2018). Celebrities such as Miley Cyrus and stylists Elizabeth Saltzman and Karla Welch released messages of support for Gomez and denounced the brand (Delbyck, 2018). Gabbana again took to Instagram in 2018 to insult another young woman, renowned fashion blogger Chiara Ferragni. On an Image of Ferragni in her Dior wedding dress posted by Harper's Bazaar UK, Gabbana commented "Cheap" (Ritschel, 2018). Later in 2018, on a reposted image announcing the cancelled D&Gloveschina campaign and fashion show Ferragni commented "Karma" (Ritschel,

10

2018). The #DGLovesNaples ad campaign featured models donning expensive dresses next to local Neapolitans in stereotypical peasant outfits or dressed as pizza chefs (Torre, 2018). The public criticized the campaign, however, Dolce & Gabbana refused to apologize and instead Dominico Gabbana wrote on Instagram, "I will never come to Naples to advertise you again! Bad people, you are the disgusting of Italy" (Torre, 2018). Similarly, the Italian fashion house's Beijing campaign depicting models alongside stereotypical taxi drivers, garbage men and street merchants, was deemed tactless by the public (Torre, 2018). All of these examples demonstrate the importance of understanding social media's role in building and damaging a company's image. These examples also reveal the consequences of a company undergoing a crisis without employing methods of crisis communication, which can be crucial for a company to protect its relationship and image with the public.

H&M's History of Racism Although H&M's controversial history is shorter than Dolce & Gabbana's, this incident received more attention in both traditional media and social media. It is crucial for a large retail group, such as the H&M group, to remember their past mistakes in crisis communication in order to take the right steps and employ the suitable techniques to protect the brand's image. In 2013, the Swedish retailer Hennes & Mauritz (H&M), launched a `hipster headdress' (CTV Staff, 2013). Many shoppers shared complaints that the product was culturally insensitive and made fun of the aboriginal culture (CTV Staff, 2013). The feathered head piece, very similar to ones worn by aboriginal chiefs, was pulled from Canadian stores shortly after complaints were filled. The headpiece is seen as a sign of honour, respect, and leadership within the aboriginal community and could be seen as racist or ignorant when sold to those who do not understand its

11

cultural meaning and simply done it as a costume (CTV Staff, 2013). Other retailers, such as Victoria's Secret and Urban Outfitters who used similar items within their advertising campaigns also apologized and removed them from their inventories (Leibowitz, 2017).

Crisis Communication Theories Image Restoration Theory As branding crises have become increasingly prevalent, so too have theories pertaining to crisis communication (Watson and Rodrigues, 2018). The presence of readily accessible communication tools with a wide outreach such as social media has given the public the ability to maintain panopticon-like surveillance of large corporations (Watson and Rodrigues, 2018). The public access to information and ability to speedily disseminate it allows them to hold companies accountable for their actions by creating a crisis surrounding the act (Spira, 2011). For corporations experiencing a crisis, image repair is often a top concern as it places the company under scrutiny and can cause long-term damage (Benoit, 1997). The corporate image was originally understood as the visual representation of a company (Stuart and Kerr, 1999). Today, various forms of communication are crucial to the formation of the corporate image (Stuart and Kerr, 1999). The management of crisis communication is in turn important to the management of the company's image, or identity in the eyes of their stakeholders. This communication can be divided into three categories: marketing, management, and organizational communication. Each of these should fall in line with the company's core values in order to reflect a strong unified corporate image that their consumers trust (Stuart and Kerr, 1999).

12

The American political communications scholar William Benoit (1997) developed Image Restoration Theory (IRT), also known as Image Repair Theory, to provide strategies for image restoration in the event an entity's reputation is attacked (Benoit, 2014). IRT examines the performance of crisis management strategies employed by a corporation (Benoit, 1997). Benoit (2014) stresses the importance of understanding the observations held by stakeholders calling for responsibility to be claimed. In corporate crisis communications, perception quickly becomes reality and whether or not the company in question is to blame for the offensive act becomes irrelevant (Benoit, 2014). Public perception is the primary concern. When the public views the company as guilty, the organization's reputation is in urgent need of rehabilitation (Benoit, 1997). Benoit (2014) suggests five strategies for image repair, including denial, corrective action, reduction of offensiveness, evasion of responsibility, and mortification. Some corporations may either deny the act occurred entirely or shift the blame onto another actor (Benoit, 2014). Benoit (2014) suggests that shifting the blame can be more successful as it offers up a scapegoat for the public to condemn. Unfortunately, shifting blame is not always appropriate, as evidenced by Kendall Jenner's attempted to shift blame for her participation in the 2017 Pepsi commercial entirely onto Pepsi (Suggs, 2017). A few months later, Kendall released an official apology, an act of mortification, and accepted responsibility for her own actions on an episode of the reality television show "Keeping Up with the Kardashians." Corrective action, is an act done by the accused in order to return an image to its conditions prior to the offense and prevents the act from repeating (Benoit, 2014). Reducing offensiveness by minimizing the negativity around the incident is another strategy for image restoration suggested by Benoit (Benoit, 2014). One can reduce offensiveness by lessening the volume of disapproval

13

surrounding the action, comparing the act to similar events that ended worse, and offering compensation to the victims (Benoit, 2014). Supplementary tactics include transcendence, where an organization repositions the act in a better light, attacking the accuser, and bolstering (Benoit, 2014). Organizations will also voice rationalizations for their actions to evade responsibility (Benoit, 2014). Corporations may also claim to have had good intentions or suggest the incident was accidental. Defeasibility maintains the accused lacked adequate knowledge or control to prevent the outcome (Benoit, 2014). The accused may also evade responsibility by claiming the act was a reaction to another's offensive action (Benoit, 2014). Lastly, Benoit proposes the act of mortification, where companies apologize and ask the public for forgiveness (Benoit, 2014). Sincere and truthful apologies can aid in the process of regaining the public's trust (Benoit, 2014). Benoit (1997) warns that disingenuous apologies can result in further damage to a corporation's reputation. For example, when H&M first released an apology for their blatantly racist ad featuring a young African American boy in a hoodie reading "coolest monkey in the jungle" they stated, "we sincerely apologize for offending people with this image of a printed hooded top" (Pfeiffer & Mayes, 2018). Rather than apologizing for producing the offensive sweatshirt, the brand apologized for offending people (Low, 2018). This tells the public that H&M is apologetic for how people reacted to the product and not for manufacturing and advertising it. This apology angered consumers and quickly prompted a follow-up apology with more sincerity (Low, 2018). Through defining the origin of a crisis, a corporation's crisis management team is better able to select and use a fitting strategy of image repair. Therefore, examining the previously mentioned high profile Dolce & Gabbana Love China campaign through this theoretical lens will

14

offer additional understanding as to whether or not Benoit's tactics are effective tools of corporate image restoration (Pfeiffer & Mayes, 2018).

Reception of Racially Charged Advertising Racism and Advertising Edward Lama Wonkeryor (2015) notes that institutionalized racism has been present in marketing since its inception in the 1920s. The advertising industry has always been led to target those with the funds and will to buy (Wonkeryor, 2015). In the early 1920s, white Americans who comprised the mainstream population were the target (Wonkeryor, 2015). The advertising industry viewed non-white Americans as financially incapable of purchasing advertised products (Wonkeryor, 2015). Post World War II, African Americans gained notable purchasing power and became a target audience for ads (Wonkeryor, 2015). Gradually, marketing campaigns began to target more ethnically diverse populations, including, but not limited to, Latinos, AsianAmericans, and Native Americans (Wonkeryor, 2015). However, even though these ethnicities were now seen as potential buyers they continued to be portrayed in derogatory manners in other commercials (Wonkeryor, 2015). The structural decision to move away from negative stereotypical roles came from a push for marketers to connect with non-white consumers (Wonkeryor, 2015). Although racialized advertising and marketing has greatly progressed, advertisements in the twenty-first century are still accused of being racist, tone-deaf, and invoking cultural appropriation. Through modern media, the public continues to hold corporations accountable to their social responsibility by demanding that the advertising industry offer constructive racial and ethnic figures in ads (Wonkeryor, 2015).

Racism and Corporate Crisis Communication In the Handbook of Crisis Communication, Dr. Brooke Fisher Liu examines five unique cases where charges of racism landed individuals or organizations in a crisis requiring the use of various communication strategies to resolve (Coombs & Holladay, 2015). Liu reveals that these cases all involved strategies that typically avoided the discussion of race even though the crises arose from charges of racism (Coombs & Holladay, 2015). The handbook goes onto explain that organizations in comparison to individuals are able to respond to a crisis rooted in racism differently. An organization may have an easier time turning a blind eye to racism, than an individual (Coombs & Holladay, 2015). Often, organizations are able to separate themselves from the incident in order to ease stakeholder's designation of responsibility (Coombs & Holladay, 2015). Organizations can also employ the use of individuals offering up excuses, which may place the individual's reputation on the line rather than the organization's (Coombs & Holladay, 2015). In the handbook, Coombs (2015) also suggests that organizations are better equipped than individuals to apply transcendence. Denial is a tactic more suited to individuals than organizations being accused of committing a racist act (Coombs & Holladay, 2015). Liu's analysis concludes that none of the organizations undergoing racially charged crises used denial as a form of crisis management (Coombs & Holladay, 2015). Lastly, one single similarity between individuals and organizations accused of racism is the execution of an apology. However, in the past organizations were accused of being more concerned with the financial liability an apology might entail which previously resulted in corporations' fear and avoidance of apologies (Benoit, 2014). One measure for assessing the effectiveness of a response to a crisis is qualifying the public scrutiny received (Coombs & Holladay, 2015). Criticism from newspapers, online

16

articles, or social media users can be an indication that the response was not appropriate or sufficient. However, coverage can be a difficult method for analysis as some crises are less newsworthy and will therefore have an insufficient amount of coverage to assess. Liu also suggest that not all incidents endure high levels of media scrutiny (Coombs & Holladay, 2015). However, racist acts involving legal action, conglomerate media outlets, physical harm, minors, high profile celebrities, or occur during election cycles typically receive greater amounts of media scrutiny (Coombs & Holladay, 2015). Level of media scrutiny is a key factor in crisis management as the more media attention a crisis receives the more likely the public is to remember the crisis (Coombs & Holladay, 2015). The stronger the memory is within the public, the more likely the public is to attribute responsibility to the company for future crises (Coombs & Holladay, 2015). As crisis coverage is more likely to be negative and image damaging, Coombs (1997) advises that responsible parties should aim for minimal media coverage by resolving the crisis as soon as possible. Rebuilding, denial, and corrective action are the most frequently used techniques for racialized crises (Wonkeryor, 2015). Liu found most parties involved in the cases avoided mentioning race in their apology, but when they did so they used transcendence (Coombs & Holladay, 2015). However, all crises are unique and therefore it is impossible to create the perfect step-by-step guide to crisis management involving racist acts.

Social Media Social Media and Corporate Communication Social media has enabled the public to actively participate during a crisis (Zheng, Liu, & Davison, 2018). Intense negativity disseminated from the public has the potential to worsen the

17

crisis in question or damage the reputation of the firm experiencing the crisis (Zheng, Liu, & Davison, 2018). This information about a crisis communicated by the public is secondary crisis communication (Zheng, Liu, & Davison, 2018). The public predominantly distribute SCC through posts on social media networks. More recent crisis research has illuminated that the ease in posting information on social media platforms have encouraged the public to propagate SCC. According to social psychology, the public is most likely to respond to behavior seen as abnormal negatively as a way of enforcing social structure and respond to feeling violated (Zheng, Liu, & Davison, 2018). Social-Mediated Crisis Communication Model Liu, Jin, and Austin (2011) provide a modern model of crisis communications that incorporates social media. By gaining an understanding of the way the public use social media through the social-mediated crisis communication model (SMCC) corporations can better determine how to use social media platforms when managing a crisis. SMCC offers instruments through which the offensiveness of the crisis can be minimized (Liu et al., 2011). Through the source of crisis information, which observes the interaction between the company, social media players, and form, which refers to the mode of information delivery, organizations can determine the appropriate method and source through which to disseminate their response (Liu et al., 2011). Social media is a strong platform to reach the public as consumers turn to it for emotional support (Liu et al., 2011). The public can share negative accusations which can force a corporation to take responsibility for its actions. SMCC also explores how corporations use social media to respond to the public (Liu et al., 2011). SMCC references five key features: the crisis origin and type, the message's content, the message form, and the infrastructure (Liu et al., 2011). In order to successfully manage a socially mediated crises, SMCC recommends a careful

determination of the form's influence on the publics' reaction to the corporation's responses (Liu et al., 2011). Both content, the information inside the message, and the form are crucial elements (Liu et al., 2011). As scholars are exploring the value of information in corporate crisis communication, organizations should learn to communicate with emotionally heightened users, or prepare to shoulder long-term harm to their image (Liu et al., 2011).

Research Questions The research questions guiding the analysis of the case studies are: RQ 1: What strategies of crisis communication are used by these corporations and how did they affect the image of the companies? RQ 2: How is social media employed during the management of these racially-charged crises?

19

Methodology and Approach To answer the proposed research questions, qualitative inductive research will be used. Two codebooks will be developed, one to analyze the messages released by Dolce & Gabbana and H&M and a second codebook to gauge the public's response. The first codebook will be categorized using Benoit's five suggested IRT strategies: denial, evasion of responsibility, reduction of offensiveness, corrective action, and mortification (refer to table 17). Each code will specify the technique through which the strategy is employed. The data, which includes Tweets from both retail manufacturers, tweets directed at both companies, Instagram Posts by both corporations, and comments on these posts, will be collected manually. I will use this data to answer question 1 as it will reveal which strategies of crisis communication the corporations applied and how the public's views of these companies' images were impacted. This data will also be used to answer question 2 as it will demonstrate how social media was used in conjunction with IRT in order to engage with their stakeholders by addressing and resolving the crises. The data revealing the public's response will demonstrate how stakeholders and possibly third parties responded. A second codebook will categorize this data by examining the qualitative stance each post takes. Each post will be labeled as either supportive of the corporation, unsupportive, or neutral (refer to table 18). H&M's advertisement first appeared on January 8th, 2018 and was removed within 48 hours. The data collection period for this case will begin on the date the ad was posted and end on January 18th, 2018. Dolce & Gabanna's campaign began on November 16th of 2018 and the majority of aftermath of the crisis continued until November 23, 2018. Therefore, the data collected will include posts from November 16, 2018 up to December 1, 2018. In order to answer question 1, I will use this inductive form of content analysis to gain insight into how the

20

crises communications strategies used within social media in the case studies affected the corporations' images. Through the frameworks of image restoration theory and the socialmediated crisis communications model media coverage put out by the public, press, and the corporations themselves on various media platforms will be analyzed. This analysis will help determine the level of social responsibility the public felt the organizations should take ownership of and how much the corporations actually accepted. With the case studies this report will explore some of the elements of SMCC, such as whether the management of the crisis properly utilized social media, and the determination of which affects the corporations' attributions of responsibility and which crisis management strategies to use (Liu et al., 2011). This report will then go on to determine the way in which these crises response strategies incorporate social media and the way in which they address the public. For my analysis, I collected data produced by Dolce & Gabbana and H&M as well as the public's responses. This analysis explores H&M's three Instagram posts and two Tweets from January 8-16, 2018 as well as 50 response tweets and 50 response comments on Instagram. This analysis also looks at three Instagram posts and 17 Tweets released by Dolce & Gabbana from November 16-23, 2018 as well as 50 response tweets and 50 response comments on Instagram. As a way of coding each statement put out by the two brands, I used William Benoit's five Theories of Image Restoration, indicating each time a theory was used for image repair during the corporate crises (refer to table 17). The five methods I coded for were: Denial: When coding the strategy of denial, I looked for any words, phrases, or statements made separately by H&M or Dolce & Gabbana that denied any involvement or denies that the event took place.

21

Evasion of Responsibility: For coding evasion of responsibility, I noted individual claims stating that something, someone, or some event was to blame for each crisis other than H&M or Dolce & Gabbana. Reduction of Offensiveness: This coding targeted messages put out by each distinct company that highlighted H&M or Dolce & Gabbana's positive assets or compared it to companies that were in a worse situation. Corrective Action: Corrective action was coded as any statement for action or change made by H&M or Dolce & Gabbana, as well as a statement of proof that some action had been taken to prevent the reoccurrence of the situation in question. Mortification: The coding for mortification flags any form of an apology or statement requesting forgiveness made by either H&M or Dolce & Gabbana. When analyzing the public's responses, I categorized each response as either supportive, unsupportive, or neutral towards the message the corporations had released. Comments containing content criticizing the brand, requesting more action be taken, or denouncing one's support of the brand were deemed unsupportive. Comments which contained statements of agreement with the brands' original actions or current sentiments or a statement accepting an apology were categorized as supportive. Statements with neither demonstrably supportive of unsupportive content were labeled neutral. In the second codebook, intended for analyzing the data released by the public in response to the corporations' crisis communication, I used three categories. These three categories were: Supportive: When the comment suggested any level of support towards the brand, such as consumer loyalty, or agreement with the message the company had released.

22

Unsupportive: When the comment denounces the company, the company's actions, or the company's message. Neutral: The comment neither agrees with the messages released by the corporation nor does it denounce them. The comments are neither clearly supportive or unsupportive of the brand's actions, image, or products.

Discussion and Analysis Dolce and Gabbana pre-emptively incorporate the use of reduction of offensiveness into their social media posts through the act of bolstering on Twitter. Similar to many other brands, Dolce & Gabbana show their clothing on celebrities which makes the brand appear positive and desirable. This helps to counteract the negativity that comes along with a future scandal. On November 21st, 2018, Dolce & Gabbana release a Tweet coded as GI (good intentions). This tweet suggests that the corporations actions were done with the best intentions and that the outcome was entirely accidental. This form of evasion of responsibility was not well accepted by the public and was promptly followed by two apologetic tweets on November 23rd. This technique appeared to damage the brand's reputation as the public was quick to call out Dolce & Gabbana's past controversies which were not perceived to have been done with good intentions. One can understand that the misuse of Benoit's method of evasion of responsibility may have made the following apologies appear insincere in the public's eye, which led to the vast majority rejecting both apology tweets with unsupportive responses. Dolce & Gabbana's Instagram posts from November 21st had the most active interaction of the three crisis combating posts analysed. Active interaction being defined as comments and passive interaction being defined as likes. The first post was coded as DR (denial of responsibility), Out (outside one's control), PR (promise to rectify problem) , and A (apology). The second post was coded as GI (Good Intentions), and the third post on November 23rd was coded as A (apology). It is reasonable to assume that the first two posts which heavily lean on techniques such as denial, corrective action, evasion of responsibility, and small apology angered the public enough to provoke responses. Much of the public's responses carried negative undertones. Dolce & Gabbana's earlier posts employ the use of evading responsibility by

25

claiming the brand lacked the knowledge to understand their campaign was racist, the public appeared angered. Many users deemed the later use of mortification through an apology as insincere. One comment said "maybe you just worry about your sales in China when you are apologizing to us." This comment calls out the brand for apologizing only to save sales. As 40/50 response tweets were deemed unsupportive, it is clear that Dolce & Gabbana's heavy use of reduction of offensiveness was not successful in swaying the company's public image. The third post, which consisted of a clean apology was the most warmly received of the three suggesting that the company may have been better off accepting full responsibility and admitting fault alongside an apology from the very beginning. On Twitter, Dolce and Gabbana received more comments from the public that recalled the company's racists past and demanded more corrective action. Whereas, on Instagram many comments ignored the brand all together and instead aligned themselves with the Chinese people by declaring their support for the people Dolce & Gabbana had offended and therefore denouncing the Italian design house. The crisis the H&M group faced appeared to be of higher profile within the realm of social media. Dolce & Gabbana's classic consumers are women between the ages of 30-50, as this demographic are increasingly fashion conscious and earn a higher income than those younger than them (Yiassoumi, 2017). According to The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), the largest demographic of Twitter users, being (37%) is between the ages of 18-29 years old and is evenly split between genders (LSE). As well, LSE reveals that 59% of Instagram users fall between the ages of 18-29 years old. However, Dolce & Gabbana has been attempting to reach younger consumers through influencer marketing on social media (Yiassoumi, 2017). It is reasonable to consider that many of Dolce & Gabbana's loyal customers

26

may not be present on social media and therefore cannot contribute to the conversation in regards to the Tweets and Instagram posts in question. Therefore, the largely unsupportive data gathered from social media in response to Dolce & Gabbana's methods of crisis communication may not be reflective of their average consumers' sentiments. With products at a lower price point, H&M attracts an increasingly diverse range of consumers. Although the data is unavailable, one could assume these consumers include younger adults of middle class incomes, the typical demographic consumers of fast fashion. As one of the world's largest and fastest growing clothing retailers, H&M coined the term "fast fashion" (Ivan, Celia, Sarah, and Matthieu, 2019). This term describes clothing lines based on recent fashion runway trends, but are designed and mass-produced swiftly and affordably to be sold to mainstream consumers (Ivan et al., 2019). According to H&M's website, the giant retailer targets consumers aged 18-40 (Ivan et al., 2019). The brand's celebrity partnerships with the likes of David Beckham, Beyonce, Alexander Wang, The Weekend, and more may also link the brand to a larger and younger consumer base who are more likely to be active participants on social media (Pearson, 2019). When addressing the public during the crisis, H&M employed the use of corrective action in all of the company's Tweets and posts on Instagram. The statements H&M released entailed acts they had already done or planned to do in order to rectify the situation. For example, in a Tweet released by H&M on January 8th, 2018, the company wrote "we believe in diversity and inclusion in all that we do and will be reviewing all our internal policies accordingly to avoid any future issues." The now deleted Tweet was coded as B (bolstering) and PPR (promise to prevent the problem from reoccurring). It can be assumed that this combination of Benoit's methods of corrective action and reduction of offensiveness were not supported by the H&M's stakeholders

27

present on Twitter as the Tweet was removed within 24 hours. The next day, a follow-up tweet was released that detailed how apologetic the brand was and the steps they would take to rectify the situation. The match of corrective action with an apology received more supportive responses from the public without the technique of evasion of responsibility. This suggests that H&M's consumers active on Twitter respond in an positive light to the brand's acceptance of responsibility, corrective action, and apologies. H&M also employed the use of evasion of responsibility in their first two Instagram posts. The post from January 9, 2018, was coded as PPR (promise to prevent the problem from reoccurring), GI (good intentions), and A (apology). This post received a high amount of passive likes at 232,670 with 41.2k comments. However, the following post later on that day was coded as PPR and A. This post garnered fewer likes with 311k but received 60.2k comments. This suggests that Instagram users felt more inclined to actively participate in the conversation when the method of evasion of responsibility was absent. Many of the comments on these posts were unsupportive of H&M as they claimed that the apology was insincere due to past discrepancies or too late. Many of the comments were accompanied by the hashtag #boycotthm. Although the responses were mainly unsupportive of H&M on both platforms, the reasoning behind the lack of support differed between the two. Many of the responses by Twitter users questioned H&M's promise to make future changes by bringing up their past of producing racially offensive products and advertisements. On Twitter, 38/50 responses were unsupportive of the brand. On Instagram, many responses called out H&M for an insincere apology, as the brand apologized for the public's reaction toward the product and advertisement, and not for their own actions. By doing so, H&M attempted to evade responsibility. However, the brand received more support on Instagram than Twitter, with 15 supportive comments, 1 neutral, and

28

34 unsupportive. On Twitter, there was a heavy presence of negative comments directed toward the brand from celebrities such as The Weekend and rapper G Eazy, which undoubtably influenced other responses from the public. Conclusion One can understand that Dolce & Gabbana inappropriately used denial in conjunction with Benoit's other theories of image restoration. Due to the immediate nature of social media and mass amounts of active interaction with unsupportive undertones on this post, the use of social media further damaged Dolce & Gabbana's reputation. As Dolce & Gabbana's average consumer is less likely to overlap with the younger generation increasingly present on social media these platforms seem inappropriate for reaching their target audience. However, the use of these platforms may still play a role in the crisis communication management for the fashion house as they attempt to extend their consumer base to the younger generations who are ever more active on social media. As well, the research findings suggest that social media users do not respond well to H&M's evasion of responsibility. As the brand initially apologized for the public's reaction to their racist advertisement rather than taking ownership of their own actions. Additionally, corrective action in H&M's case has proven to be ineffective. The brands promise to resolve the issue and prevent it from reoccurring did not sit well with their audience as many were quick to call out the brands previous racial blunders that were followed up by the same promises. However, the act of taking corrective action by removing the advertised product from stores and online accompanied by an apology was well received by stakeholders on Instagram and Twitter. Some unforeseen difficulties emerged within the process of collecting the data manually and analyzing these two case studies. The first obstacle to emerge was that the Dolce & Gabbana

29

case involved some text in both Chinese and Italian alongside the English. This data was therefore exempt from the collection and analysis process. As well, manually collecting and logging the data proved to be more time consuming than originally anticipated. Celebrity endorsement was also an unanticipated aspect that was not originally accounted for. However, considering the impact of celebrity influence it was deemed necessary to highlight to possibility of their persuading power over public behaviour on social media. Although the two case studies differ in consumer bases, they both demonstrate both improper use of Benoit's techniques in corporate crisis communication followed by improved use of his methods. Each company received varying levels of backlash on Twitter and Instagram due to the varying presence of their consumer demographics on these platforms. Also, as both companies are repeat offenders in regards to putting out racially charged campaigns and advertisements it proved increasingly difficult for them to receive public support. These cases provide valuable insight into how to handle future racially charged corporate crises. Both cases demonstrate both successful and unsuccessful use of Benoit's Image Restoration Theory techniques within two fast paced social media environments that can have large impacts on the damage and recuperation of the brands' public images.

who work at H&M, can only agree. We're deeply sorry that the picture was taken, and we also regret the actual print. Therefore, we're not only removed the image from our channels, but also the garment from out product offering. It's obvious that our routines haven't been followed properly.

discomfort it has caused. We have taken down the image and we have removed the garment. We will now be doing everything we possibly can to prevent this from happening again in the future.
