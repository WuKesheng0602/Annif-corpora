Field-based assessment of the influence of agriculture and urbanization on benthic macroinvertebrates in southern Ontario and laboratory-based assessment of the toxicity of road salt to biofilms Michelle Lucas Master of Applied Science, 2018 Environmental Applied Science and Management Ryerson University ABSTRACT The abundance and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates (BMI) were measured across four streams that span a gradient of urban and agricultural land cover in south-central Ontario. For each stream, BMI surveys were carried out across three seasons for reference (upstream) and test (downstream) sites with chloride being a contaminant of interest to this study. While two of the test sites had stream chloride concentrations that exceeded national guidelines for chronic toxicity, only the site with the highest proportion of urban land cover in its drainage area suggested compromised community compositions across all study seasons. Additionally, the impact of sodium chloride, the most common road salt type, was studied on freshwater biofilm communities under laboratory conditions, where biofilms at high concentrations of salt show a high degree of aggregation.

1.0. INTRODUCTION

1.1. Overview of Thesis
The use of organisms as indicators of anthropogenic harm to the environment has been ongoing for decades (Hynes, 1960; Carson, 1962; Cairns & van der Scalie, 1980; Reynoldson & Metcalfe-Smith, 1992; McCarthy et al., 1994; Jones et al., 2007). In particular, surveys of benthic macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity (i.e., small, aquatic organisms lacking a backbone) have routinely been conducted in aquatic environments to assess aspects of aquatic ecosystems such as water quality and aquatic ecosystem health. The abundance and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates (BMI) were measured across four streams that span a gradient of urban and agricultural land cover in south-central Ontario. The areas of the Lake Simcoe and Nottawasaga River watersheds are subjects for these types of assessments since they have been experiencing rapid urbanization in recent years from pressures for the human population to move north of Toronto with concomitant population growth within the area. Hence, there is a concern that urbanization leads to a variety of anthropogenic contaminants in the environment, such as chloride from road salt runoff from the maintenance of safe driving conditions during the winter. While it is recognized that there are a myriad of possible anthropogenic stressors that could impact the distribution of these organisms (Dance & Hynes, 1980), a contaminant of particular concern to this study is chloride. Benthic macroinvertebrates are ideal candidates for the study of impacts from contaminants due to their range of pollution sensitivities and their crucial membership in the aquatic food web (Jones et al., 2007; Kenney et al., 2009). They feed on a variety of food sources including microorganisms and vegetation while they are also prey to a variety of fish (Vannote et al., 1980; Merritt & Cummins, 1996; Vanderzanden & Vadeboncoeur, 2002) and waterfowl (Covich et al., 1999; Rodriguez-Perez & Green, 1

2012). Thus, contaminant impact to these species could have significant ramifications throughout the entire food web (Jones et al., 2007). Concomitantly, studies assessing the impact of chloride on benthic macroinvertebrates and other freshwater organisms have been conducted in laboratories for decades and most recently, in an attempt to establish Canadian Water Quality Guidelines (Giesy & Hoke, 1989; Corsi et al., 2010; (CCME, 2011)). However, there is a paucity of field-based studies linking in-stream chloride concentration dynamics to toxicological impacts on benthic macroinvertebrates. In Southern Ontario, where road salt is heavily used to maintain safe winter travel conditions, moving beyond separate field-based macroinvertebrate surveys and lab-based toxicological tests is imperative for improving our understanding of the impacts of increasing salinity on aquatic ecosystems (Winter et al., 2011). Lastly, laboratory studies can provide information under rigorously-controlled conditions while field studies provide ecologically-relevant information (United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), 1998; Bostan et al., 2005; Cooke et al., 2017). In combination, laboratory and field studies can provide a thorough analysis of impact from contaminants to organisms, and it is only biological toxicity tests that can be used to determine impact to organisms (McCarthy et al., 1997; Connon et al., 2012). While laboratory toxicity tests using chloride have been conducted on a suite of benthic macroinvertebrates since the 1950s, few laboratory studies have assessed the impact of chloride on aquatic communities of microorganisms known as biofilms, especially those that contain multiple species (Rotter et al., 2013 Schuler et al., 2017). It has been well-established that biofilms are a crucial component of the aquatic food web, and negative implications to these organisms could have significant ramifications to organisms of higher trophic levels, including many benthic macroinvertebrate groups since biofilms are an important component of their diet (Simon et al., 2003; Guash et al., 2016; Groendahl & Fink, 2017). However, there is a paucity of information on laboratory 2

studies that consider chloride toxicity to aquatic biofilms containing multiple species, and the current thesis will attempt to address this knowledge gap.

1.2. Background Information on Freshwater Benthic Macroinvertebrates 1.2.1. Definition of Benthic Macroinvertebrates Benthic macroinvertebrates are small, bottom-dwelling organisms of aquatic ecosystems that lack a backbone (Rosenberg & Resh, 1993). They form the 27-group level of taxonomy that was established by the Ontario Benthos Biomonitoring Network (OBBN) as a standardized protocol (Jones et al., 2007), which includes a combination of phylum, class, order, and family. Many of these organisms include insects that are in the aquatic stage of their lifecycle (Rosenberg & Resh, 1993). An identification key for some of these benthic macroinvertebrate groups is depicted in Figure 1, and a description of all 27 groups has been provided in Appendix C.

1.2.2. Factors Controlling Natural Variation in the Distribution of Benthic Macroinvertebrates in Freshwater Systems There are many interacting factors that can influence the distribution of benthic macroinvertebrates in freshwater systems beyond the presence or absence of contaminants. These factors must be considered when making assessments of aquatic ecosystem health based on benthic macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity. This broadly includes the competition for resources, predation pressures, and the adaptations that species have acquired to allow them to survive and thrive in particular aquatic niches (Merritt & Cummins, 1996; Rodriguez-Perez & Green, 2012). More specifically, the factors that influence the suitability of a habitat for benthic macroinvertebrates include 4

i) functional feeding groups, ii) the River Continuum Concept, iii) water quality requirements, iv) substrate preferences, and v) morphological characteristics (Hawkins & Sedell, 1981; Merritt & Cummings, 1996).

i) Functional Feeding Groups Benthic macroinvertebrates can be placed into categories based on the feeding strategies that they implement to meet their nutritional requirements. The main groups that these organisms can belong to are known as shredders, scrapers, filtering-collectors, gathering-collectors, and predators (United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), 2012)) and are described in more detail below: Shredders are organisms that break down and consume coarse particulate organic matter (>1 mm in diameter), which can often consist of leaf litter and woody debris (Cummins & Klug, 1979; Vannote et al., 1980; Merritt & Cummings, 1996). Some examples of benthic macroinvertebrates that are considered shredders include Amphipoda (scuds), Tipulidae (crane flies), Diptera (true flies), Ephemeroptera (mayflies), and Trichoptera (caddisflies) (Cummins & Klug, 1979). Scrapers are organisms that consume algae and biofilms that are often attached to surfaces; hence, they are usually found to be present in environments that provide hard substrates (i.e., rocks) (Vannote et al., 1980; Graca, 2001). Some examples of benthic macroinvertebrates that are considered scrapers are Coleoptera (beetles), Gastropoda (snails, limpets), and Lepidoptera (aquatic moths) (Cummins & Klug, 1979). Filtering-collectors consume fine (<1 mm to >50 Âµm in diameter) to ultrafine (<1 mm to >0.5 Âµm in diameter) particulate organic matter as well as algae in the water column (Cummins & Klug, 1979; Graca, 2001). This is accomplished through the attachment to surfaces by collecting particulate 5

organic matter that is suspended in the water column using specialized mouth parts, such as labral fans (Jones et al., 2007). Some examples of filtering-collectors within the benthic macroinvertebrate groups include Simuliidae (black flies) and net-spinning Trichoptera (caddisflies). Gathering-collectors include organisms that break down fine (<1 mm to >50 Âµm in diameter) to ultrafine organic matter (<1 mm to >0.5 Âµm in diameter) (Merritt & Cummings, 1996), often containing biofilms (Vannote et al., 1980). This is accomplished through the collection of particulate organic matter that is no longer suspended in the water column and hence, occupies surfaces such as rocks (Jones et al., 2007). Some examples of gathering-collectors within the benthic macroinvertebrate groups include Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Gastropoda (snails, limpets), Nematoda (roundworms), Oligochaeta (aquatic earthworms), Plecoptera (stoneflies), as well as some species of Diptera (true flies) (Cummins & Klug, 1979). Predators include organisms that gain their nutritional requirements by eating other living aquatic organisms, which often includes the consumption of other benthic macroinvertebrates (Cummins & Klug, 1979; Merritt & Cummings, 1996). Some examples of predators within the benthic macroinvertebrate groups include Anisoptera (dragonflies), Megaloptera (fishflies, alderflies), and Zygoptera (damselflies) (Cummins & Klug, 1979). Additionally, some members that belong to other feeding group categories can also consume other organisms, especially during periods in their lifecycle when protein requirements are high (Cummins & Klug, 1979). Furthermore, predators are often found in environments that support a variety of prey organisms and can also influence the location, abundance, and size of prey in the area (Covich, 1999). Within each of the above groups, these organisms can be generalists or specialists based on their selectivity of food resources that they consume. For instance, shredders and scrapers are known to be specialists since they consume a narrow range of food resources while filterers and gatherers are known 6

to be generalists since they consume a broad variety of food resources (USEPA, 2012). Hence, the availability of these food resources can determine the presence and abundance of these organisms. As well, pollutants can create an imbalance in the available food resources, which can induce stress conditions for these organisms and hence, can compound factors affecting their distribution (Vannote et al., 1980; Merrritt & Cummins, 1996).

ii) Influence of the River Continuum Concept on Benthic Macroinvertebrate Distribution The River Continuum Concept, as shown in Figure 2, was first described by Robin L. Vannote (1980) as the changes that occur longitudinally within a stream that influence the distribution of benthic macroinvertebrates based on their feeding strategy as well as the food resources that are available (Covich et al., 1996). In upstream reaches, it is expected that there is an increased amount of leaf litter and a large proportion of shredders that break down this coarse organic matter (Vannote et al., 1980). The residual particles are then washed downstream for other benthic macroinvertebrates to consume; specifically, those that have adapted to feeding on smaller organic particles (Vannote et al., 1980). Within the midreaches of streams, it is expected that there is a decreased presence of shredders due to the reduction of coarse organic matter. Concomitantly, there is an increased presence of collectors and grazers that feed on the increased amount of algae that grows with increased exposure of the stream to sunlight due to the reduced overhanging vegetation (Vannote et al., 1980). Within downstream reaches, it is expected that there is an increased stream depth along with increased presence of collectors and filterers that consume fine organic matter. This material has largely become available due to the processes and organisms that break down larger particulate matter in the upstream reaches (Vannote et al., 1980). This is also an area that has decreased light penetration due to greater stream depth and hence, it is expected that there would be fewer grazers from the decreased amount of algae available as 7

a food resource (Vannote et al., 1980).

iii) Water Quality There are a variety of water quality parameters that may affect the distribution of benthic macroinvertebrates in freshwater environments, including pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and salinity. pH: The levels of pH in streams typically range between 6.0 and 8.0, and influences the 8

abundance and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates (McFadden & Cooper, 1962; Hynes, 1970; Wetzel, 2001). Organisms are generally adapted to intermediate pH levels in streams, with only a few species that can maintain homeostasis at the extremes of the pH scale (i.e., Chironomidae (non-biting midges)) (Courtney & Clements, 1998; Rapport & Whitford, 1999). Many organisms are particularly sensitive to low or high pH levels, especially Ephemeroptera (Courtney & Clements, 1998). The pH levels in streams may be influenced by a variety of abiotic factors, such as rocks that act as buffers to pH as well as by contaminants such as chemicals that adjust the pH to be higher or lower (Giller & Malmqvist, 1998). Dissolved Oxygen: Abundant dissolved oxygen in an aquatic environment is ideal for many aquatic organisms to live; hence, only certain aquatic organisms have adapted to survive and thrive in waters with low dissolved oxygen content (i.e., Chironomidae (non-biting midges) (Wetzel, 2001). Dissolved oxygen requirements in freshwater typically range between 1-6 mg/L for organisms in deep, bottom waters and 4-15 mg/L for organisms in shallow waters (USEPA, 2013). The amount of oxygen within an aquatic system can be attributed to turbulent water flow and the diffusion rate of oxygen (Merritt & Cummings, 1996). Additionally, stressors, such as eutrophication, can lower the dissolved oxygen content in aquatic environments by bacterial consumption of both the decomposing algal blooms and concomitant depletion of dissolved oxygen (USEPA, 2013). However, some aquatic organisms have adapted to breathe atmospheric oxygen, such as species of Coleoptera (dytiscid and hydrophilid beetles), Gastropoda (snails, limpets), and Culicidae (mosquito wrigglers) (Merritt & Cummings, 1996). Some benthic macroinvertebrates can even obtain their oxygen requirements from plants, such as species of Coleoptera (chrysomelid beetle) (Merritt & Cummings, 1996). Temperature: Water temperature is also an important factor to consider since many aquatic organisms can only withstand temperatures that range between 0 and 18 degrees Celsius, but most 9

benthic macroinvertebrates prefer temperatures around 10 degrees Celsius (Chadwick & Feminella, 2004). Temperature can increase the solubility of dissolved oxygen and is a critical component for the initiation of metamorphosis and time to emergence for many aquatic insects (Wetzel, 2001). Warmer temperatures directly affect the growth, metabolism, and reproduction of benthic macroinvertebrates, as well as, the quality and quantity of food due to concomitant bacterial processes (Merritt & Cummings, 1996). Shallow and lentic streams are generally warmer and result in faster growth of benthic macroinvertebrates that is also facilitated by abundant algal resources as food (Wetzel, 2001). Additionally, temperature affects the presence of resources (i.e., leaf litter) that enter the water during different seasons in temperate climates, but organisms have also adapted to these conditions by going into diapause as well as by entering quiescent periods (Merritt & Cummings, 1996). Conductivity The conductivity in water is another parameter that influences the distribution organisms in aquatic environments. Measurements of conductivity can often be used as a proxy for determining chloride concentration; hence, the effect of conductivity to aquatic organisms will be discussed in the context of chloride ions throughout this thesis, and in particular, Section 1.4.

iv) Substrate Preferences Substrate type has a strong influence on the distribution of benthic macroinvertebrates (Merritt & Cummins, 1996). Substrate classes in the benthic layer of aquatic environments include clay (hard pan), silt (particle diameter: <0.06 mm), sand (particle diameter: 0.06-2 mm), gravel (particle diameter: 2-65 mm), cobble (particle diameter: 65-250 mm), boulder (particle diameter: >250 mm), and bed rock (Jones et al., 2007). However, there is a generalized preference amongst all benthic macroinvertebrates for rock (i.e., cobble and boulder) and gravel because they provide spaces for refuge and surfaces for attachment of benthic macroinvertebrates as well as the food resources (i.e., algae, biofilms) they often 10

consume (Merrit & Cummins, 1996; Collier & Meredith, 1998).

v) Morphological characteristics Benthic macroinvertebrates have morphological characteristics that allow them to occupy a variety of environmental conditions. These adaptations provide them with specializations to thrive in particular aquatic niches and in dynamic relationships with other organisms (Merritt & Cummins, 1996; Poff et al., 2006; Cummins et al., 2008; USEPA, 2012). They can be categorized as burrowers, climbers, clingers, divers, planktonic, skaters, swimmers, and sprawlers (Merritt & Cummins, 1996; USEPA, 2012): Burrowers are organisms that inhabit fine substrates or tunnel into plant parts (i.e., roots or stems). They contain specialized structures for digging and are commonly found in the pools (slow moving and deep waters) of streams as well as lakes. Some examples of burrowers include Chironomidae (non-biting midges), Oligochaeta (aquatic earthworms), Ephemeroptera (mayflies) such as Ephemera sp. or Tipulidae (crane flies) such as Tipula sp. (Cummins et al., 2008; He et al., 2015). Climbers are those that live on leaves, stems, and roots of aquatic plants as well as woody materials (i.e., submerged branches and logs). They contain specialized structures that allow them to climb up these resources. Climbers includes Anisoptera (dragonflies) such as Aeshnidae sp. or Planaeschna sp, Chironomidae such as Tanytarsus sp., Coleoptera such as Cyphon sp., and Trichoptera such as Goerodes sp. (Cummins et al., 2008; He et al., 2015), Clingers have morphological adaptations that allow them to attach to surfaces such as the construction of a fixed retreat, sucker on ventral gills, and dorsoventral flattening (Cummins et al., 2008). They are commonly found in waters that are fast moving, and particularly in the riffles (fast moving and shallow waters) of streams. This category includes Ephemeroptera (mayflies) such as 11

Heptageniidae sp., Diptera (true flies) such as Blephariceridae sp., Trichoptera such as Hydropsychidae sp., and Plecoptera (stone flies) such as Isoperia sp. (Cummins et al., 2008; He et al., 2015). Divers can often be found ascending to the surface of the water for the acquisition of atmospheric oxygen as well as descending back down the water column. They are also known to cling or crawl on substrates and can use their hind legs to exhibit a rowing form of movement. Divers are predominately found in the pools (slow moving and deep waters) of streams as well as lakes. This category includes Hemiptera (true bugs) such as Corixidae sp. and Coleoptera (beetles) such as Dytiscidae sp. (Cummins et al., 2008; He et al., 2015). Planktonic benthic macroinvertebrates are those that predominantly float and use water currents to move horizontally (Merritt & Cummins, 1996). However, they also can swim for the acquisition of food and oxygen, as well as to evade predation. This includes Diptera (flies) such as Chaoboridae sp. and Culicidae (mosquito larvae) (Merritt & Cummins, 1996; Cummins et al., 2008). Skaters can move along the top of the water surface without breaking the surface tension. They commonly feed upon organisms that are stuck in the surface film. Skaters include Hemiptera (true bugs) such as Gerridae sp. (Merritt & Cummins, 1996; Cummins et al., 2008). Swimmers cling to bottom sediment and aquatic vegetation, and display "fish-like" swimming behaviours (Cummins et al., 2008). They commonly occupy stream and lake habitats as opposed to wetlands and lotic aquatic environments. This category includes Ephemeroptera (mayflies) such as Baetidae sp. or Habrophlebiodes sp., and Coleoptera (beetles) such as Liodessus sp. (Cummins et al., 2008; He et al., 2015). Sprawlers can be found on the surfaces of floating leaves and fine substrata (Cummins et al., 2008). They often contain long legs for locomotion on these surfaces. These organisms include 12

Ephemeroptera (mayflies) such as Caenidae sp., Tabanidae (deerfly larvae) Trichoptera (caddisflies) such as Psilotreta sp., and Diptera (flies) such as Atherix sp. (He et al. 2015). The above adaptations assist the organisms with attachment to surfaces, concealment from predators and environmental stress, as well as provide them with the mobility to navigate through a variety of flow conditions (Poff et al., 2006; Cummins et al., 2008). Hence, benthic macroinvertebrates are expected to occupy environments that are well-suited to their behavioural, morphological, and physiological characteristics (Cummins et al., 2008). These features can also allow them to exploit resources that can change both spatially and temporally (Poff et al., 2006).

1.2.4. Description of important benthic macroinvertebrate groups The benthic macroinvertebrate groups listed below were selected for focus in the current thesis due to their representation of important roles in streams and for their relative susceptibility to contaminants such as chloride. i) Bivalva (clams, mollusks) and Gastropoda (snails, limpets) These organisms are moderately pollution-sensitive (Jones et al., 2007), and some mollusks that belong to the Bivalva group are listed as endangered and may not be protected by the national guidelines for chloride in freshwater (Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME), 2001). Hence, they may have a lower tolerance to chloride than the levels suggested by the CCME guidelines (CCME, 2001). Bivalva spend their entire lifecycle within the aquatic environment and negative impacts may be representative of contaminants in the aquatic environment (as opposed to some of the benthic macroinvertebrate insects that can be impacted by contaminants in the terrestrial environment following emergence). Few aquatic Gastropoda contain lungs that allow them to breathe atmospheric oxygen that allows them to withstand aquatic environments with low dissolved oxygen 13

(De Lange, 1994). Some of their morphological features include two shells connected by a hinge ligament for Bivalva and one shell that forms a coil for Gastropoda. These features allow them to find refuge from the external environment if conditions are unfavourable (Jones et al., 2007). The water quality requirements include sensitivity to waters with high turbidity for Bivalva since certain types of sediments may hinder them from feeding (De Lange, 1994). As well, they are intolerant to environments containing high organic matter with organic pollutants (De Lange, 1994). Bivalva are filter feeders (filter-collectors) (De Lange, 1994) and are expected to be most abundant in the downstream portion of streams while Gastropoda are grazers of plant matter and algae on surfaces (De Lange, 1994) and are expected to be most abundant in midstream reaches.

ii) Anisoptera (dragonflies) and Megaloptera (fishflies, alderflies) These organisms are known to be moderately pollution-sensitive (Jones et al., 2007) and are particularly susceptible to low dissolved oxygen environments (Peckarsky et al., 1990). They are predators (Peckarsky et al., 1990) that feed on a variety of other benthic macroinvertebrates (i.e., aquatic insects, Oligochaeta, Crustaceans and Molluska) (Peckarsky et al., 1990) and hence, require an environment that is able to support a variety of prey sources, including those that are pollutionsensitive. Hence, Anisoptera and Megaloptera can be present in aquatic environments that provide ideal water quality conditions and are low in contaminants due to abundant sources of prey in these areas.

iii) Amphipoda These organisms are pollution-sensitive, and are well-known for their importance in ecological systems and abundance in aquatic environments (Thomas, 1993; Jones et al., 2007; Alonso et al., 2010). They complete their life stages entirely within the aquatic ecosystem and hence are impacted by 14

contaminants that partition in the water and sediment layer (Jones et al., 2007). They can be even more susceptible to contaminants in the juvenile stage of their lifecycle (Alonso et al., 2010), and their highest expected abundance occurs in September (Jones et al., 2007). Water quality requirements of Amphipoda include high dissolved oxygen and cold water temperatures (Pennack, 1989). Some species of Amphipoda are particularly susceptible to heavy metals (Alonso et al., 2010) and pesticides (Ippolito et al., 2012). Additionally, they belong to the feeding groups of shredders and grazers (De Lange, 1994) and hence, commonly feed on organic matter as well as biofilms (De Lange, 1994).

1.5 Presence or absence of key indicator organisms i) Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Plecoptera (stoneflies), and Tricoptera (caddisflies) These three organisms have been grouped together by previous scientists for their similarity in susceptibility to contaminants since they are known for being pollution-sensitive (Poff et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2007). Their presence in an aquatic environment may be indicative of a healthy aquatic ecosystem and their absence may be indicative of an unhealthy aquatic ecosystem that may contain contaminants and/or other stressors (Poff et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2007). Regardless of the influence of contaminants, these organisms undergo seasonal variations in abundance, with their lowest abundance during the summer months due to peak emergence and highest abundance in May and November (Jones et al., 2007). Their water quality requirements consist of cooler temperatures, high dissolved oxygen, and neutral pH (Peckarsky et al., 1990; Alhejoj et al., 2014). Hence, it is expected that these organisms will be found to have a higher abundance in environments that provide these conditions. Additionally, the River Continuum Concept, as discussed previously, suggests that Ephemeroptera are expected to be most abundant in the midstream reaches since they are grazers (De Lange, 1994) of detritus and algae (Peckarsky et al., 1990). Plecoptera are expected to be most abundant in the 15

headwaters of streams since they are known to be shredders of plant material or predators of other aquatic organisms (De Lange, 1994). Trichoptera are expected to be most abundant in the downstream area of streams since they are known as collectors that feed on fine particulate matter on surfaces such as plants and rocks (De Lange, 1994).

ii) Chironomidae (non-biting midges), and Oligochaeta (aquatic worms) These organisms have been noted by other scientists for being pollution-tolerant to many contaminants, and can often withstand both stressful environmental conditions and contaminants (Jones et al., 2007). Hence, their presence in the environment along with the absence of other benthic macroinvertebrates can be indicative of environments that are experiencing some type of stressor. However, their distribution is also influenced by other factors such as seasonal variability, with the lowest percent Chironomidae in September (Jones et al., 2007). Oligochaeta complete their lifecycle entirely within the aquatic ecosystem (Jones et al., 2007) and hence are impacted solely by contaminants that partition in the water and sediment layer. Both Chironomidae and Oligochaeta have water quality requirements that are strikingly different than many other benthic macroinvertebrates, particularly the pollution-sensitive organisms. They can withstand pH levels of 6.0-9.0, but some species of Chironomidae can survive at higher extremes (Pinder, 1986). As well, they are able to thrive in environments with low dissolved oxygen content due to their ability to store oxygen in their hemolymph (Jones et al., 2007) and hence, can be indicators of eutrophication (Pinder, 1986; Merritt & Cummins, 1996). They can also be used as indicators of anthropogenically-derived sedimentation, deforestation, and other contaminants (Merritt & Cummins, 1996). There are also some species of Chironomidae that are highly tolerant to increases of salinity whereas both Chironomidae and Oligochaeta are particularly tolerant of heavy metal contamination, as well as organic pollutants 16

(Pinder, 1986; Pennak, 1989). Chironomidae are scavengers of detritus but are known to be able to survive on bacteria alone (Pinder, 1986), while Oligochaeta are known to be scavengers, predators, or detritivores that generally feed on dead particulate organic matter as well as algae and diatoms (Pennak, 1989). Hence, both Chironomidae and Oligochaeta are able to occupy many environments due to their lack of food selectivity. All of these factors combined enable Chironomidae to be the most widely distributed and often most abundant benthic macroinvertebrate group (Pinder, 1986; Lindegaard, 1995; Gerecke et al., 1998; Chris Jones, pers. comm., 2016). However, their distribution in aquatic systems may be limited by unfavorable substrate types (Pinder, 1986).

1.2.3. Benthic Macroinvertebrates as Indicators of Aquatic Ecosystem Health In the early 1970s, there was a concern that most aquatic toxicity tests were focused on fish that are generally less sensitive to contaminants than aquatic invertebrates. Since then, studies on the impacts of a wide range of many contaminants have been conducted on the behaviour and physiology of both fish and benthic macroinvertebrates (Baudouin & Scoppa, 1974; Johnston et al., 2014).It is important for the purposes of toxicity testing to use a suite of organisms due to the wide range of sensitivities to contaminants that exist among different species as well as the use of organisms that are environmentally-relevant to the area of study (Bostan et al., 2005; Puddephatt, 2013). However, this also poses a challenge for field-based assessments since there is a wide range of species that can exist among locations, especially in areas of Canada that span a range of climates and ecozones (CCME, 2011). Benthic macroinvertebrates are used for biomonitoring as early-warning indicators of harm to the environment, ecosystems, and organisms (including humans) (Li et al., 2010; Parmar & Rawtani, 2016). They are also ideal candidates for the study of contaminants since they have a range of 17

differential sensitivities, and they feed on a variety of food sources such as vegetation and other benthic organisms, and are prey to a variety of fish (Vannote et al., 1980; Merritt & Cummins, 1996; Vanderzanden & Vadeboncoeur, 2002) and waterfowl (Covich et al., 1999; Rodriguez-Perez & Green, 2012). This makes them important contributors to the food web, and impacts of pollutants to these species could suggest impacts to organisms at higher trophic levels (Jones et al., 2007). Also, benthic macroinvertebrates have a characteristic low range of mobility that makes impact studies on these organisms relevant to assess toxicity in the area they occupy (Jackson & Harvey, 1993; Jones et al., 2007). The impact of contaminants in freshwater environments can be assessed through benthic macroinvertebrate surveys of abundance, diversity, and presence or absence of species based on their specific tolerance to pollutants (Jones et al., 2007). While contaminants can be chemically analyzed, the only way to determine their impact is through the information provided by organisms (McCarthy et al., 1997). Biological toxicity tests are typically conducted in a laboratory setting under rigorouslycontrolled conditions, but this does not provide information about the impact of contaminants to organisms under site-specific conditions. Hence, only field work can provide ecologically-relevant information (Bostan et al., 2005), but the results often contain a number of confounding challenges. Furthermore, even when a suite of assessment mechanisms are used, the results are not always perfectly predictable (Giesy & Hoke, 1991). Hence, it is important to consider a variety of factors that may have influenced the results and to replicate these tests in both laboratory and field settings (Giesy & Hoke, 1991; Jones et al., 2007). The Ontario Benthos Biomonitoring Network (OBBN) developed protocol for field testing using benthic macroinvertebrates to determine impact to these organisms in Ontario (Jones et al., 2007). Using this protocol, benthic macroinvertebrates are sampled from freshwater systems, such as 18

streams, and are identified at the 27-group level (i.e., phylum, class, order, and family) of taxonomy to determine impact based on abundance and diversity (Jones et al., 2007). Hence, samples showing a lower abundance and diversity are likely more negatively-impacted than samples showing a higher abundance and diversity (Jones et al., 2007). If negative impact is found, then the sampling site can be further explored to determine the potential sources of impact (Jones et al., 2007).

1.3. Background Information on the Use, and Environmental Fate, of Road Salt in Canada In Canada, the most predominant anthropogenic source of chloride in the environment is from salt (NaCl) that is used for the de-icing of roads to provide safer driving conditions during the winter months. Salt is also applied to sidewalks, parking lots, and other surfaces to prevent the hazard of slipping (Perera, 2009; Winter et al., 2011). The application of salt to roads has prevented many car accidents and injuries to people, and must be used in weather that results in icy surfaces to prevent injuries and avoid lawsuits. Therefore, the Ministry of Transportation (MTO) and private property owners are obligated to apply road salt in areas that they are responsible for and they may also be liable if harm occurred as a result of failure to take reasonable care to de-ice these surfaces. Chloride can also occur naturally in the environment due to erosion of rock (Ontario, 2014), and can be released into the aquatic ecosystems through the erosion and weathering of rocks (Mayer, 1999). The climate, especially rising temperature, can increase the solubility of salt, and also affects the presence and concentration of chloride as well as the amount of evaporation and precipitation (Mayer, 1999). Additionally, chloride concentration of marine environments can reach upwards of 19, 400 mg/L with a salinity of 35,000 mg/L, while many organisms have adapted to living in both marine and other saline environments (Vernier, n.d.). 19

The increase of chloride in aquatic ecosystems can occur during snowmelt and low-flow conditions (Allert et al., 2012), and spikes in concentration tend to be in close proximity to major roadways with a high volume of roadways (LSRCA, 2015), as well as urban areas (CCME, 2011). Of these, the highest concentrations of chloride were found in streams close to rapidly urbanized areas and major roadways (Winter et al., 2011). The properties of chloride make it very persistent in the environment, such as its high solubility in water, mobility, and concentration in water as well as its low ability to be removed through biodegradation, precipitation, volatilization, and adsorption to mineral sediment, as established by the Canadian Water Quality Guidelines (CCME, 2011). Following snow melt and storm events, runoff from roads and other surfaces wash road salt into nearby watersheds. Additionally, there is currently a lack of technological solutions for the removal of chloride from the environment (Meriano et al., 2009). The amount of road salt that is stored in watersheds is 40-77%, and may remain there for years (Todd & Kaltenecker, 2012). The highest concentrations of chloride in the environment were found by ministry scientists in the summer months as a property of the lag time that exists for chloride to enter watersheds (Ontario, 2014. This also means that there may be a lag time for the detection of reductions of chloride applications from road salt (Ontario, 2014). The concentration of chloride in the environment depends on the source inputs to the environment as well as differences in evaporation and precipitation (Mayer, 1999). Finally, the use and management of these anthropogenic sources of chloride are attributed to a balance of the safety of roads during winter snow conditions, volume of vehicles on roads or usage of roads, duration of transportation, as well as costs to the economy (Perera, 2009).

20

1.4. Impacts of Chloride from Road Salt on Benthic Macroinvertebrates 1.4.1. Potential for Chloride from Road Salt to Directly Impact Benthic Macroinvertebrates Road salt is present in freshwater ecosystems in southern Ontario due to runoff following snow melt and precipitation events, particularly during winter conditions in urbanized areas with high road densities (Todd & Kaltenecker, 2012). However, before further discussion can ensue, it must be recognized that while road salt is a concern in freshwater systems in southern Ontario, thousands of contaminants could also impact organisms in the aquatic environment. Thus, only correlation, and not causation, can be made between impact to benthic macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity, and elevated road salt concentrations. In this study, chloride is the ion of interest since it is present in most forms of road salt. Additionally, its impact on the physiological systems of living entities is well-known. Chloride is an essential anion for processes such as excretion and pH balance in aquatic organisms (Evans & Frick, 2001) but the concentrations of chloride, within biological systems, must be balanced in order to maintain proper functioning for the maintenance of homeostasis (Davenport, 1985). In normal concentrations of chloride, water flows in and out of cells until it reaches equilibrium as it moves from an area of low concentration of chloride to high concentration of chloride (Davenport, 1985; Pereira, 2013). Many of the aquatic insects that are considered benthic macroinvertebrates have a body plan that facilitates the uptake of chloride when concentrations are low; for example, the placement of specialized cells on the gills of Culex pipiens (Culicidae/mosquito larvae) function by increasing the surface area on this region for greater acquisition of chloride (Merritt & Cummings, 1996). Conversely, it is possible that there are also adaptations in some organisms that decrease the uptake of chloride during elevated environmental concentrations; for example, Callibaetis sp. (Ephemeroptera/mayfly larvae) have the ability to reduce the number of cells that are responsible for the uptake of chloride 21

during elevated concentrations (Merritt & Cummings, 1996). However, these organisms may not be able to excrete the chloride necessary to maintain these balances if concentrations of chloride are too high (Evans & Frick, 2001) and failure to do so can result in lethality due to the inability to maintain homeostasis. When the concentration of chloride is too high in the aquatic environment, these organisms can lose water from cells in a process known as osmosis (Davenport, 1985). When the concentration of chloride is too high in the cells of the organisms, water can flow into the cells and eventually burst. Hence, it is essential that concentrations of chloride in the water are healthy for organisms living in freshwater. If more energy is expended on maintaining osmolarity for homeostasis, this could negatively impact the survival, growth, and reproduction of these organisms (Evans & Frick, 2001). Similarly, excess chloride could lead to lowered body mass of these organisms, thus weakening the organisms and making them more susceptible to predation (Evans & Frick, 2001). Also, this could lead to a delay in metamorphosis or failure to reach sexual maturity and alter the emergence period for the aquatic insects. This could result in the failure to reproduce, thus lowering the number of offspring in future generations and have detrimental effects on the propagation of future generations (Evans & Frick, 2001). Ephemeroptera (mayflies) may be particularly susceptible since they must emerge from the water to reproduce within a very short time period, which is usually between 1-2 days (Edmunds & Edmunds, 1980; McCafferty, 1983). Additionally, excess chloride is a concern in aquatic environments for benthic macroinvertebrates that live in watersheds receiving high road salt loads since they are an important component of the aquatic food web and can impact the success of organisms at higher trophic levels, such as fish (Vanderzanden & Vadeboncoeur, 2002) and waterfowl (Covich et al., 1999).

22

1.4.2. Potential for Chloride from Road Salt to Indirectly Impact Benthic Macroinvertebrates (i.e., Meromixis) Elevated chloride concentrations may also indirectly impact organisms by increasing the density of water and thereby preventing the mixing of lakes due to chemical stratification, leading to hypoxic bottom waters (Novotny et al., 2007). This is a concern for organisms including benthic macroinvertebrates that live in the bottom sediments of freshwater lakes since they can be affected by low levels of oxygen from this lack of vertical mixing with upper layers in the water (Evans & Dillon, 1982). While stratification is not usually a concern in streams, impact to benthic macroinvertebrates in lakes can also have an impact on benthic macroinvertebrates in connecting streams since many aquatic insects emerge from lakes in the adult stage of their lifecycle and can lay eggs into other areas, thus affecting the propagation of future generations (Covich et al., 1999).

1.4.3. Laboratory Studies of Chloride Toxicity on Benthic Macroinvertebrates and other Aquatic Organisms Laboratory-based studies have been carried out since the mid-1950s, and a suite of organisms, including benthic macroinvertebrates, have been used to evaluate chloride toxicity. It has been wellestablished that chloride is a toxicant at high concentrations, but the specific concentration is dependent on the species. The aquatic organisms that have been studied in a laboratory setting include, but are not limited to, insect nymphs (i.e., Baetis tricaudatus (mayfly), Lepidostoma sp. (caddisfly), Chironomus tentans (midge)), gastropoda (i.e., Gyraulus parvus, Physa gyrina), mollusks (i.e., Elliptio laceolata, Lampsilis siliquoidea, Sphaerium simile), cladocerans (non-benthos; i.e., Ceriodaphnia dubia, Daphnia magna, Daphnia pulex), crustaceans (i.e., Eudiaptomus padanus, Hyalella azteca, Lirceus fontinalis), rotifers (non-benthos; i.e., Brachionus calyciflorus, Brachionus patulus), aquatic worms (i.e., 23

Lumbriculus variegatus, Tubifex tubifex, Erpobdella obscura (leech)), and algae (non-benthos; i.e., Chlorella emersonii, Chlorella minutissimo, Chlorella zofingiensis). A summary of the laboratory tests used to establish the Canadian Water Quality Guidelines (CWQG) for acute and chronic effects to freshwater organisms by CCME (2011) can be found in Table 8 and Table 9, respectively, in Appendix A, and this data shows the effects of chloride concentrations under rigorously controlled conditions. Additionally, the species sensitivity curve in Figure 3 was generated by CCME (2011) to compare the impact of chloride in freshwater to fish, amphibian, and invertebrate species, which range in LC50/EC50 toxicity data from approximately 120 mg/L where species are not impacted in the short term to approximately 10,000 mg/L for some fish species in the short term. The invertebrate species are affected at a range of chloride concentrations while some are affected at the lowest concentrations of chloride and may be used as early-warning indicators of harm to larger species, such as fish.

The arrow at the bottom of the graph is the 5th percentile and the corresponding short-term benchmark concentration value. The data was derived by fitting the Normal model to the logarithm of acceptable toxicity data (CCME, 2011). This image was obtained by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment, 2011. 1.4.4. Field studies Relating Benthic Macroinvertebrate Distributions to Stream Chloride Concentrations The following studies were conducted as field assessments of elevated chloride concentrations using benthic macroinvertebrate surveys of abundance and diversity in Southern Ontario: A study conducted on the groundwater springs of the Greater Toronto Area, including waters from the Oak Ridges Moraine, indicated that some species could be associated with the presence of high chloride concentrations (Williams et al., 1999). For instance, the presence of the stonefly, Nemoura trispinosa, with the absence of the amphipod, Gammarus pseudolimnaeus, could indicate moderate to high concentrations of chloride (Williams et al., 1999). 25

In a study conducted on Laurel Creek in Waterloo, Ontario, the drift responses (detachment from initial habitat due to stressors or unfavourable environmental conditions (Merritt & Cummins, 1996)) of three benthic macroinvertebrate species were examined while exposed to increased chloride concentrations (Crowther & Hynes, 1977). Hydropsyche betteni (Trichoptera/caddisfly), Cheumatopsyche analis (Trichoptera/caddisfly), and Gammarus pseudolimnaeus (Amphipoda/scud) did not show relocation downstream as a behavioural response to chloride concentrations until 750 mg/L, but all individuals showed this response to chloride concentrations at 2165 mg/L (Crowther & Hynes, 1977). Therefore, a paucity of field-based studies that connect the abundance and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates to spatial and temporal patterns of stream chloride concentrations in Southern Ontario.

1.4.5. Confounding Factors of Benthic Macroinvertebrate Field Studies Involving Chloride Toxicity There are a variety of confounding factors in field-based chloride studies that make it difficult to determine if the organisms were impacted by chloride or some other factor. There are a variety of other contaminants in the terrestrial landscape and in aquatic ecosystems that may potentially affect the health of aquatic organisms. However, laboratory studies of chloride toxicity on freshwater aquatic organism health have been studied extensively under rigorously-controlled laboratory conditions and it is known to be a toxicant at elevated concentrations, and so it is possible that the impacts to aquatic organisms may be caused by chloride. As well as other contaminants, there are other water quality factors that could affect the toxicity of chloride to these organisms. For example, the presence of bicarbonate in water may reduce the uptake of chloride in some organisms, thereby increasing their 26

chloride tolerance (Hoke et al., 1992). Also, other abiotic factors could contribute to the negative impacts of chloride such as low flow of water in stream conditions that can reduce oxygen content and uptake of oxygen via the gills of aquatic organisms, leading to increased stress in combination with the chloride and not just the chloride acting alone (Lowell et al., 1995). Additionally, the presence of high chloride concentration in porewater in benthic sediment may also change the concentrations of heavy metals, such as cadmium, and may indirectly impact aquatic organisms (Mayer, 1999). These confounding factors are important considerations and emphasize that only correlations can be made between benthic macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity and chloride concentrations, and not necessarily entail causation. 1.5. Background Information on the Study Region and Watersheds 1.5.1 Urbanization in the Lake Simcoe and Nottawasaga River Watersheds The Lake Simcoe and Nottawasaga River watersheds are located north of the City of Toronto and have undergone some rapid urbanization in recent years. With urbanization and the need for commuters to easily access services and workplaces in nearby cities, roads and highways are being extended through these watersheds. Urban development in this region is expected to increase with concomitant population growth of 4.3 million or 30.2% by 2041 (Ontario Places to Grow, 2017) and this, along with changes in climate bringing more frequent winter freeze-thaw events, is expected to result in an increase in road salt being applied. The locations of the Nottawasaga River and Lake Simcoe watersheds have been provided in Figure 3.

27

Figure 4. Location of the Nottawasaga Valley and Lake Simcoe watersheds in Southern Ontario. This map was obtained from the Muskoka Watershed Council, 2018. 1.5.2. Contaminants in the Study Area Agricultural and community/infrastructure land cover types dominate in the study watersheds and may lead to suite of other contaminants in the study streams. There are a variety of pathways that can lead to contaminants entering the aquatic environment from point and non-point sources (Hill, 1997) including, but not limited to, the discharge of effluent from municipal and industrial establishments, atmospheric depositions, as well as surface runoff and movement through groundwater (Kolak et al., 1998). Some of the most common types of contaminants from agricultural land types that could influence benthic macroinvertebrates include fertilizers (Good & Beatty, 2011) and pesticides (Gilden et al., 2010; Dance & Hynes, 1980). Fertilizers contain nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus that can lead to eutrophication and hence, create anoxic conditions in the aquatic environment following 28

runoff from nearby fields (Chislock et al., 2013). Pesticides exist as herbicides (i.e., Atrazine, glyphosate-based products, Triazine), fungicides (i.e., Sulfur-based products, Zinc dimethyldithiocarbamate), and insecticides (i.e., Chloropicrin, Diazinon, Chlorpyifos) that are most commonly used to eliminate organisms that impede crop growth (Gilden et al., 2010; Environment Canada (EC); World Health Organization (WHO), 2018). Residential areas can include pesticides used for domestic gardening (i.e., soap, Borax), and residues in from washing vehicles with cleansers (i.e., surfactants), which then enter the watershed (Nor & Zayadi, 2016). As well, the emptying of swimming pool water can enter streams directly or can enter sewer systems and eventually reach surface waters. The chlorine in pool water converts to hypochloric and hypochlorous acid and then contribute to chloride ions in the watershed (Erlimaz & Palabiyik, 2012). Urbanized areas are also commonly correlated with increased road densities. This can lead to a variety of contaminants entering the watershed from runoff including de-icing chemicals (i.e., sodium chloride, calcium chloride, potassium chloride, etc.) (Winter et al., 2012), oil and grease from vehicles, as well as heavy metals from tires (i.e., copper, zinc, etc.) (Apeagyei et al., 2010). Furthermore, wastewater treatment plant effluent, sewer overflow, and septic tank leakage can lead to many contaminants eventually reaching these areas (i.e., toluene, 1,4- dichlorobenzene, chloride) (USEPA, 1984). While this is not an exhaustive list of contaminants that may exist within the study area, it is representative of just some of the contaminants that may be present within the environment and must be considered in a holistic assessment of aquatic ecosystem health. 1.5.3. Evidence of Increasing Chloride Concentrations in Rivers and Lakes in the Study Area Taking into consideration all of the potential anthropogenic sources of contaminants in the environment, chloride is a reoccurring contaminant that may exist from a variety of domestic sources 29

(i.e., pool water, pesticides, septic tanks), industrial sources (wastewater treatment plants, various processing plants), and agricultural sources (i.e., fertilizer compounds, animal feed). One of the largest anthropogenic sources of chloride is from road salts that enter the environment through surface application to paved surfaces, improper storage, and runoff from snow disposal sites. In a study by Winter et al. (2011), the concentration of chloride in some of the streams of the Lake Simcoe watershed, and in Lake Simcoe itself, were shown to be increasing. While water quality monitoring and benthic macroinvertebrate surveys are being conducted in the watersheds by local conservation authorities, there are streams that belong to the Lake Simcoe watershed and the Nottawasaga River watershed that require further assessment such as comparisons between upstream and downstream locations (LSRCA, 2015). Additionally, there is an increasing trend in stream chloride concentration not only following snow melt but into the summer growing season in some streams. It is unclear if these increases in chloride concentration at the end of winter and early spring affect benthic macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity. The increasing chloride concentrations in these areas have been known to surpass the chronic guidelines of 120 mg/L of chloride in freshwater set out by CCME during the spring, summer, and fall months, as well as increasing chloride concentrations that surpass the acute guidelines set out by CCME following winter snow and ice melt that bring large amounts of chloride into the receiving watersheds. It is also unclear if benthic macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity is affected by these seasonal changes that coincide with fluctuations in chloride concentration (CCME, 2011). It is also unclear if the guidelines provided by CCME for acute (640 mg/L) and chronic (120 mg/L) toxicity of chloride in freshwater are applicable to watersheds surrounding Lake Simcoe. 1.5.4. Future Implications from Increasing Chloride in the Environment In recent years, climate change has caused higher precipitation and greater snow depth that have 30

led to higher applications of road salt and thus increasing concentrations of chloride in the environment (Winter et al., 2011). Vertical mixing of aquatic systems is needed for replenishing oxygen in lower layers of lakes and supplying nutrients to upper layers of lakes (Novotny et al., 2007). Small, deep lakes are particularly affected by this meromixis ((Novotny et al., 2007). The productivity of lakes, streams and wetlands may increase and cause shifts in the species that inhabit these regions in the form of relocation as a behavioural response (Evans & Frick, 2001). When the concentration of salts are in excess of their products formed after solubilizing, the salts may crystallize and enter the sediment layer of aquatic ecosystems (Mayer, 1999). A particular concern for benthic macroinvertebrates is the chloride in the porewater that collects in the sediment layer of aquatic ecosystems (Mayer, 1999). The excess chloride may shift algal populations to be dominated by cyanobacteria, which could lead to the formation of harmful algal blooms when combined with the loss of organisms that feed on algae (such as benthic macroinvertebrates) (USEPA, 2017). This may heighten anoxic conditions, especially in the benthic region of aquatic ecosystems, and lead to the further decline of benthic species and other organisms. As well, the amount of heavy precipitation events which mobilize chloride from groundwater to surface water has increased by 74% (1958-2010) and can be partially attributed to climate change (Pinkney et al., 2014). The expected increase in precipitation from climate change could lead to more snowfall during the winter months and thus require higher amounts road salt to be applied. Additionally, the increased precipitation that is expected from climate change could lead to the increased mobility of chloride as runoff to nearby streams as snow melt (Pinkney et al., 2014). Also, stratification could cause hypoxia die-offs (Pinkney et al., 2014) that can be heightened by global climate change in combination with stratification from elevated chloride levels from road salt (Pinkney et al., 2014).

1.6. Background Information on Freshwater Biofilms This study sought to examine environmentally-relevant chloride concentrations under laboratory conditions and the biological system utilized was biofilms. Their importance at the base of the aquatic food web cannot be overstated and thus, assessing them for chloride impact was of great interest. 1.6.1. Definition of Aquatic Biofilms Aquatic biofilms are a composition of diatoms, algae, bacteria, protozoa, and/or fungi that attach to each other and/or surfaces using sticky substances called extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) (i.e. lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, etc. (Mahfoud et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016), microbial lyses products (Mahfoud et al., 2009), and/or particulates (Mahfoud et al., 2009). The EPS can also function as a matrix for storing water and chemicals while having the capability to sometimes protect the biofilm from poor environmental conditions and contaminants (Berner et al., 2015). 1.6.2. Structure and Composition of Aquatic Biofilms Biofilms usually form gradients with different layers that can often consist of microenvironments (Berner et al., 2015). For instance, cells at lower layers of biofilms are not easily mobile and must obtain nutrients and other resources as well as remove waste products through diffusion (Berner et al., 2015). Biofilms are formed through a combination of factors including, but not limited to, the hydrology of the area, light exposure, and nutritional contents (Mahfoud et al., 2009). They can also be described using a variety of factors such as colouration, consistency, dry or volatile materials present, and dissolved organic substances (Mahfoud et al., 2009). There are drastic differences between organisms participating in biofilms of free-moving cells and immobile cells attached to a surface (Berner et al., 2015). Furthermore, there are drastic differences 32

at all stages of biofilm development in moving, flowing systems when compared to sessile, immobile systems (Berner et al., 2015; pers. comm. M. Kroukamp, 2018). For instance, cells at upper layers of the biofilm can adapt to higher light intensities while cells at lower layers can adapt to low light availability. Some of the cells at lower layers may even adapt to heterotrophic conditions (Berner et al., 2015). As well, the microorganisms that form the base of the biofilm can die off and provide a carbon and nitrogen source to facilitate growth of the upper layers of the biofilm (Berner et al., 2015; Kroukamp, pers. comm., 2018). Biofilms are complex communities of organisms that can adapt to many environmental circumstances. They can adjust to perform new roles in the biofilm and contribute to the success of the biofilm as a whole. Some of the success of biofilms can occur at the expense of other cells of the biofilm. Therefore, studying these communities and their interactions can provide information about the health of aquatic ecosystems using a suite of organisms. 1.6.3. Biofilms as Indicators of Aquatic Ecosystem Health Biofilms are useful for the assessment of anthropogenic stressors in aquatic environments with water quality as the main influence over biofilm community structure (Cortelezzi et al., 2013; Aubertheau et al., 2017). The presence or absence of certain species in biofilms as well as abundance, diversity and functional components (Cortelezzi et al., 2013; Paule et al., 2015), can be an indication of the physical, chemical, and biological components of the aquatic environment as well as the overall health of the ecosystem (Wang et al., 2014; Li et al., 2017). Biofilms participate in many processes that occur in aquatic ecosystems, such as those involved with biogeochemistry, energy, and nutrients (Li et al., 2017). Biofilms can the ability to remove some contaminants from aquatic environments via their 33

capability to perform bioadsorption and biodegradation (Mahfoud et al., 2009; Shabbir et al., 2017). They can adsorb contaminants such as pharmaceuticals from wastewater treatment plant effluent and contain antibiotic resistance genes that can be induced by the presence of these types of contaminants (Aubertheau et al., 2017). They serve a variety of functions in areas of wastewater, aquaculture and agricultural practices, as well as many bioremediation processes such as those involved in wetlands (Li et al., 2017). Biofilms also play a role in reducing the toxicity of emerging contaminants by their metabolism (Shabbir et al., 2017; Aubertheau et al., 2017; Peralta-Maraver et al., 2018). Biofilms can be characterized using comparative analyses to reference biofilm cultures through measurements of chlorophyll a, abundance and diversity counts, biomass, as well as growth inhibition (Cortelezzi et al., 2013; Paule et al., 2015; Aristi et al., 2016). These assessments can provide insight on the toxicity of a variety of contaminants. Changes to the community structure or composition can lead to information about impact to aquatic ecosystems. Hence, the assessment of contaminants, such as chloride, can be accomplished using hydrological and ecological approaches, concomitantly (Peralta-Maraver et al., 2018). 1.6.4. Importance of Biofilms in Food Web Dynamics Biofilms in food web dynamics include organisms at higher trophic levels, such as benthic macroinvertebrates, that feed on biofilms or components of it, as a food source. There are many types of benthic macroinvertebrates that feed on biofilms including grazers, such as many insect and mollusk species. For instance, biofilms consisting of cyanobacteria are a high-quality food source for benthic macroinvertebrate grazers that have been used to control these harmful blooms (Groendahl & Fink, 2017). Furthermore, studies on food web dynamics in ecotoxicology include bioaccumulation and biomagnification from biofilms to the benthic macroinvertebrates (Guash et al., 2016). 34

The impact of contaminants to biofilms can be affected by the presence or absence of some benthic macroinvertebrates, particularly grazers, commonly magnifying the impacts of contaminant toxicity in combination with the grazing pressure of macroinvertebrates (Guash et al., 2016). For instance, carbon in biofilms and diversity of algal species can be reduced by grazers (i.e. Physa acuta) exposed to the herbicide, atrazine. However, some studies saw an increase in chlorophyll production and diversity of algal species while others showed no association at all. (Guash et al., 2016). Concomitantly, healthy biofilms in quality and quantity may reduce the toxicity of contaminants for other organisms, such as reducing the susceptibility of negative impacts of selenium to mayflies (Guash et al., 2016). There is an interplay of mechanisms involved that determines biofilm community structure, such as grazing pressure that can amplify the negative implications from contaminants to the biofilm community (Guasch et al., 2016). The presence of some contaminants can further reduce algal species in the biofilm that are less abundant and can also limit the growth of the biofilm as a whole following the impacts of grazing pressure (Guasch et al., 2016). Conversely, grazers can help to restore periphyton in biofilms after they have been released from grazing pressure following the exposure to some contaminants (Guasch et al., 2016). This occurs due to the oxidative stress that is reduced while the capacity for the biofilm to uptake phosphorus is increased (Guasch et al., 2016). As well, increases of biofilm density in the hyporeic zone of aquatic ecosystems can lead to increases of water residence times and adsorption surfaces, which can also be enhanced by the presence of grazers (Peralta-Maraver et al., 2018). Overall, synergistic interactions between species within a biofilm can withstand the stressful impacts of grazing by protecting the community as a whole, including species sensitive to grazing pressures (Raghupathi et al., 2018). While being exposed to contaminants, dominance by tolerant taxa 35

has been shown in degraded aquatic ecosystems for both biofilms and macroinvertebrates (Cortelezzi et al., 2013). Hence, the use of a suite of organisms to assess aquatic ecosystem health can provide more information for mitigation and biomonitoring techniques (Cortelezzi et al., 2013). This includes changes to the aquatic food webs with the complexity of trophic levels reduced (Cortelezzi et al., 2013). 1.7. Impacts of Chloride from Road Salt on Aquatic Biofilms Sodium chloride has been used to eradicate biofilms in locations that may cause harm to humans such as in sewage pipes (Mahfoud et al., 2009). Sodium chloride has been shown to cause the dispersal of biofilms and calcium chloride has been shown to cause the biofilms to aggregate (Mahfoud et al., 2009). The use of sodium chloride (NaCl) has been implemented to control the growth of excessive biofilms in wastewater treatment practices (dosSantos et al., 1997) where 2% NaCl wt/vol significantly reduced biofilm growth whereas, without any NaCl, the biofilms would grow exponentially. However, in some cases, sodium chloride may actually be used in the formation of biofilms and has been investigated for pathogenic bacterial biofilms (Lim et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2014). As well, biofilms may be less susceptible to negative implications from sodium chloride in the biofilm system than in suspended biomass of the microorganisms (Artiga et al., 2003). Furthermore, in a mesocosm study conducted by Cochero et al., (2017), biofilms from a nutrient rich stream were exposed to sodium chloride which resulted in a reduction of abundance of biofilm organisms and lowered the consumption of oxygen. However, the biofilm community returned to normal within three days following removal of sodium chloride. This is an example of the resilience of biofilms and their ability to recover from stressors in the aquatic environment. Hence, understanding these relationships and their applicability for determining impact from 36

contaminants such as road salt is complex, and a variety of factors must be considered. A list of toxicological studies using biofilms to determine impacts from sodium chloride can be found in Appendix A. Overall, synergistic interactions between species within a biofilm can withstand the stressful impacts of grazing by protecting the community as a whole, including species sensitive to grazing pressures (Raghupathi et al., 2018). While being exposed to contaminants, dominance by tolerant taxa has been shown in degraded aquatic ecosystems for both biofilms and macroinvertebrates (Cortelezzi et al., 2013). Hence, the use of a suite of organisms to assess aquatic ecosystem health can provide more information for mitigation and biomonitoring techniques (Cortelezzi et al., 2013). This includes changes to the aquatic food webs with the complexity of trophic levels reduced (Cortelezzi et al., 2013). 1.8. Knowledge Gaps, Research Questions and Hypotheses, and Anticipated Significance of Results There is a paucity of information on the abundance and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates in the East Holland River and Willow Creek subwatersheds of the Lake Simcoe and Nottawasaga River watersheds, respectively. There is also a need to determine if the water quality guidelines for chloride in freshwater provided by CCME are applicable to the East Holland River and Willow Creek subwatersheds. While the following hypotheses were not statistically tested, they are listed below as research questions and expectations: 1) Do differences in benthic macroinvertebrates abundance and diversity exist between sites located upstream and downstream of urban areas? H11: The abundance and diversity of benthic macroinvertebratess will both be lower at all test sites (i.e., downstream of urban areas) than reference sites (i.e., upstream of urban areas). H12: The abundance and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates across sites will be negatively 37

correlated to road density in the upstream contributing area for each site. 2) Do benthic macroinvertebrates abundance and diversity vary seasonally? H21: The abundance and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates at downstream, impacted sites will be lowest in the springtime (after the spring freshet). 3) Are the acute and chronic toxicity levels for chloride set out by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment applicable to the benthic macroinvertebrates in streams in centralsouthern Ontario? A hypothesis was not formulated for this research question due to it being exploratory in nature. 4) Are biofilms negatively impacted by chloride concentrations found at sites under laboratorycontrolled conditions? H41: The algal cell growth will be reduced at high sodium chloride concentrations. 5) Are the acute and chronic toxicity levels for chloride set out by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment applicable to freshwater biofilms? A hypothesis was not formulated for this research question due to it being exploratory in nature.

Chloride toxicity tests have been well-documented for a suite of different species; however, the Nottawasaga Valley Conservation Authority (NVCA) and Lake Simcoe Regional Conservation Authority (LSRCA) do not make comparisons of benthic macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity between upstream and downstream locations in comparison to chloride levels in areas of the Nottawasaga River and Lake Simcoe watersheds, respectively. This thesis will attempt to address these gaps in the research and provide a foundation of knowledge for others to build upon in future studies by exploring the impact of road salt. If impact is found, it may be necessary that best management practices are implemented in these areas during winter road salt application. The purpose of this thesis is to explore some of these issues to better understand the impact of chloride to benthic macroinvertebrates in the Lake Simcoe and Nottawasaga River subwatersheds and 38

to better prepare for future implications to benthic macroinvertebrates as urbanization and application of road salt continue to increase in these watersheds. This study will attempt to assess aquatic ecosystem health using surveys of benthic macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity alongside measurements of chloride concentrations within these subwatersheds. This research will also attempt to determine the impact of chloride to freshwater biofilms under rigourously-controlled laboratory conditions using environmentally-relevant chloride levels that were recorded at the benthic macroinvertebrate sampling sites. This combination of field testing using benthic macroinvertebrates and laboratory-based studying of biofilms will attempt to determine any implications to organisms at the base of the aquatic food chain in the form of biofilms and potential implications to organisms at higher trophic levels in the form of benthic macroinvertebrates. This research will serve to provide a benchmark for benthic macroinvertebrates abundance and diversity as an indicator of aquatic ecosystem health in these watersheds, which can be compared to past, as well as, future data collected by local conservation authorities. This can help to determine if there are any changes to the health of organisms in the streams of these subwatersheds following longterm reductions in the applications of road salt and other attempts to restore aquatic ecosystem health through stewardship programs implemented by local conservation authorities.

2.0. METHODS

The following methods will be used to address the objectives of monitoring the abundance and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates in the (i) Willow Creek subwatershed of the Nottawasaga River watershed, and (ii) the East Holland River subwatershed of the Lake Simcoe watershed in Southern Ontario that have been impacted by road salt runoff. Another objective of this project was to determine the applicability of the CCME guidelines for acute and chronic toxicity of chloride in freshwater systems at the benthic macroinvertebrate monitoring sites. An additional objective to this research project was to determine the impact of sodium chloride on freshwater biofilms under laboratory conditions by using the chloride concentrations found at field sites as well as the chloride concentrations provided by the CCME guidelines. 2.1. Study Sites for Benthic Macroinvertebrate Surveys 2.1.1. Study Watersheds The Willow Creek subwatershed is located to the west of Lake Simcoe and is part of the Nottawasaga River watershed, which drains into Georgian Bay. The Willow Creek watershed is dominated by agricultural land cover (66.01% of watershed area (Ontario Flow Assessment Tool (OFAT), 2018); Figure 4) with smaller built-up urban areas (11.71% of watershed area (OFAT, 2018); Figure 4), such as the town of Midhurst, located in the higher order reaches of the stream network downstream of Little Lake. Road density is highest in areas classified as urban land cover and hence these areas are most likely to receive road salt applications, as shown in Figure 5. The East Holland River subwatershed is located to the south of Lake Simcoe and is part of the Lake Simcoe watershed. This subwatershed consists largely of the community/infrastructure land cover 40

type (27.33% of watershed area (OFAT, 2018); Figure 6) but still contains some agricultural spaces (59.57% of watershed area (OFAT, 2018); Figure 6). Like Willow Creek, road density is highest in the areas of East Holland subwatershed classified as urban land cover, as shown in Figure 7.

2.1.2. Reference and Test Site Selection In this study, the C/I approach described in the Ontario Benthic Biomonitoring Network (OBBN) manual was used and reference sites were located upstream of urban areas (Green, 1979; Bailey et al., 2004; Jones et al., 2007) where stream chloride concentrations were expected to be relatively low. Test sites were located downstream of the urban areas, which were expected to contribute chloride to the stream via melt water runoff from paved areas that receive road salt. In both watersheds, all sites were co-located with previously-installed water quality monitoring sites. In the East Holland River watershed, one reference-test site pair has a major highway running between them, and the other reference-test pair has a small urban area between them. Specific characteristics of each study site and their hydrologic contributing areas are described below.

2.2. Field Protocol for Stream Benthic Macroinvertebrate Surveys Biological sampling was conducted according to the Ontario Benthos Biomonitoring Network (OBBN) protocol (Jones et al., 2007). 2.2.1. Kick-and-Sweep Methodology for Benthic Macroinvertebrate Collection Benthic macroinvertebrates surveys were conducted by sub-sampling in three locations according to the riffle and pool pattern of a typical stream meander, as shown in Figure 8.

51

Figure 9. A typical stream meander demonstrating 1. riffle; area of fast-moving, shallow water and 2. pool; area of slow-moving, deep water as well as 3. transects (A, B, C, D) This image was reproduced from Gilmore Creek Restoration (http://gilmorecreekrestoration.blogspot.com/2013/11/creating-pools-and-riffles.html#!/2013/11/ creating-pools-and-riffles.html)

The riffle 1 sub-sampling site was always located upstream of the pool sub-sampling site and the riffle 2 sub-sampling site was always located downstream from the pool sampling site. The benthic macroinvertebrates were first collected at the riffle 2 site, followed by the pool site, and then the riffle 1 site to ensure that upstream collections would not distort organism counts for downstream benthic macroinvertebrate collections.

52

2.2.2. Benthic Macroinvertebrate Collection In-stream Benthic macroinvertebrate samples were collected at each sampling site using the kick-andsweep method described by Jones et al. (2007) in the OBBN protocol manual using a 500 micrometer D-net, as shown in Figure 9.

Figure 10. Demonstration of the kick-and-sweep method using a 500 micrometer D-net at one of the sampling sites. This diagram was modified from Laurel Darris (https://slideplayer.com/slide/9636506/). Benthis macroinvertebrate sampling was conducted on precipitation-free days during the summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017 seasons. The winter season was excluded due to stream ice cover and associated safety concerns. The D-net was placed downstream of the person collecting with the opening facing upstream, and close to the bottom of the stream, as shown in Figure 4. The Kick-and-Sweep began at the one side of the stream bank and ended at the other side of the stream bank to constitute a transect, as shown in Figure 8. A timer was started as the Kick-and-Sweep began and ended when the Kick-and-Sweep stopped. The net was swept back and forth, vertically and horizontally (i.e., through the water column), as the substrate at the bottom of the stream was kicked to 53

a depth of 5 centimeters, as shown in Figure 9. The sampling effort consisted of travelling approximately 10 meters in 3 minutes, as recommended by the OBBN manual. The D-net was sieved by repeatedly dipping the net into the water, as needed, to allow excess sediment to pass through the Dnet while still containing all of the collected benthic macroinvertebrates. Large debris and abiotic entities (i.e., rocks, twigs, vegetation) as well as any organisms that clearly were not benthic macroinvertebrates (i.e., fish), were removed manually from the D-net. The contents of the D-net were then dumped into a white plastic basin (10-L) and the benthic macroinvertebrates were roughly counted to determine if the minimum 100 count requirement had been obtained. If the minimum 100 count of benthic macroinvertebrates had not been obtained, another transect located approximately 30 centimetres upstream was sampled for benthic macroinvertebrates using the same Kick-and-Sweep methodology. This process was repeated until 100 or more organisms were collected. The total distance travelled as well as the time of sampling was recorded for each transect. 2.2.3. Benthic Macroinvertebrate Collection On-shore The benthic macroinvertebrates collected at each sub-sampling site were transferred into clear, 4-Liter plastic containers with a twist-top lid. The organisms were then preserved using enough 70% ethanol to cover the entire sample. The contents were placed in a cool, dark location in the field vehicle with freezer packs to negate any degradation from the dilution of ethanol that could result from the release of fluids. The containers were transported back to the laboratory and stored in a fridge at 8 degrees Celsius until processing. Holding time varied from days to months. 2.3. Assessment of Habitat Characteristics A suite of characteristics were measured and assessed to determine habitat suitability of each benthic macroinvertebrate sampling site, which included water quality (pH, temperature, and 54

conductivity), riparian vegetation and percent canopy cover, dominant substrate classes, organic matter, maximum hydraulic head, maximum depth, and sampling distance covered. The water quality measurements of pH, temperature, and conductivity were collected using a Eutech Instruments PCS Testr 35 water quality probe. The types of riparian vegetation that were present on both sides of the stream bank were categorized as either cultivated, meadow, scrubland, mainly coniferous forest or mainly deciduous forest. This was based on a visual evaluation of the banks of the stream while facing downstream. Percent canopy cover was based on a visual evaluation of either 024%, 25-49%, 50-74%, or 75-100%. The first and second dominant substrate class were recorded based on a visual evaluation of the stream bed at each of the sub-sampling locations. Classes included clay, silt, sand, gravel, cobble, boulder, or bedrock. The presence of any organic matter was recorded (abundant, present or absent) and classified as woody debris and detritus, macrophytes (emergent, rooted floating, submergent, and free floating) and/or algae (floating, filaments, attached, and slimes/crusts). The maximum hydraulic head and maximum depth of the stream were measured at each sub-sampling site using a meter stick. Finally, the sampling distance covered (i.e., stream width x number of sampling passes) was measured at each sub-sampling site using a tape measure. A full description of these habitat characteristics were recorded and have been provided in the Appendix B for each site under "Field Sheets". 2.4. Laboratory Protocol for Benthic Macroinvertebrate Sorting and Identification The benthic macroinvertebrates were identified to 27-group level of taxonomy described by the OBBN manual using a Leica EZD40 dissection microscope and a Leica CME bifocal light microscope at 4X magnification. The OBBN 27-group level of taxonomy includes the following classifications for freshwater benthic macroinvertebrates in Ontario: Amphipoda (scuds), Anisoptera (dragonflies), 55

Bivalva (clams, mussels), Ceratopogonidae (biting midges), Chironomidae (midges), Coelenterata (hydras), Coleoptera (beetles), Culicidae (mosquitos), Decapoda (crayfish), Miscellaneous Diptera (other true flies), Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Gastropoda (snails, limpets), Hemiptera (true bugs), Hirudinea (leeches), Hydrachnida (mites), Isopoda (sow bugs), Lepidoptera (aquatic moths), Megaloptera (fishflies, alderflies), Nematoda (roundworms), Oligochaeta (aquatic earthworms), Plecoptera (stoneflies), Simuliidae (black flies), Tabanidae (horse flies, deer flies), Tipulidae (crane flies), Trichoptera (caddisflies), Turbellaria (flatworms), and Zygoptera (damselflies) (Jones et al., 2007). A thorough description of these organisms can be found in the Appendix C. 2.4.1. Assessment of Benthic Macroinvertebrate Community Composition 1. The contents from each sub-sampling site were emptied separately into a white, plastic basin (10-L). 2. Benthic macroinvertebrates were scooped randomly (as blind samples) using a stainless steel kitchen ladle into another white, plastic basin (10-L) for counting. 3. The organisms were picked out of the basin using fine-tipped tweezers and placed into 50 milliliter clear glass bottles with a plastic polyseal cap and preserved using 70% ethanol. 4. Each ladle containing benthic macroinvertebrates were selected in their entirety until a new ladle-full were added to the basin. 5. This process was repeated until 100 individual benthic macroinvertebrates were counted, at which point, the last ladle containing the one-hundredth transferred benthic macroinvertebrate was counted in its entirety. 2.4.2. Calculation of Abundance and Diversity of Benthic Macroinvertebrates Following sampling and identification, the abundance and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates 56

was calculated. Abundance was calculated as the number of benthic macroinvertebrates collected at each subsampling site based on the total number of organisms picked in the sample until all of the benthic macroinvertebrates in last ladle containing the one-hundredth organism were identified. Diversity was calculated as the number of different benthic macroinvertebrate groups present within the total organisms that were sampled. The total abundance for each subsampling site was summed as two riffles and pools to get a larger sample size (Jones et al., 2007; pers. comm. Chris Jones, 2018) that is representative of each subsampling site (i.e., Total abundance for Matheson Creek upstream site (Matheson Creek Upstream (UP_MAT)) = abundance Matheson Creek Upstream (UP_MAT) (riffle 1) + abundance Matheson Creek Upstream (UP_MAT) (pool) + abundance Matheson Creek Upstream (UP_MAT) (riffle 2). Statistical analysis was not performed to determine the statistical significance of any impact that was found using benthic macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity since there were many confounding factors involved in field sampling. 2.4.3. Calculation of Biological Indices using Benthic Macroinvertebrates The benthic macroinvertebrate data was also evaluated by the following biological indices. While there are a variety of biological indices that can be used to summarize benthic macroinvertebrate data, the indices recommended by the OBBN manual are the percent of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (% EPTs), percent of Worms (% Worms), percent of Dominants (% Dominants), percent of Diptera (% Diptera), and percent of Insects (% Insects). % EPTs: This was calculated as the sum of all Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera collected at each sampling site (i.e. the 3 sub-samples combined) divided by the total number of organisms collected (i.e., ~300 count). % Worms: This was calculated as the sum of all Oligochaeta collected at each sampling site 57

(i.e., the 3 sub-samples combined) divided by the total number of organisms collected (i.e., ~300 count). % Dominants: The % Dominants was calculated as the sum of the most abundant group of benthic macroinvertebrates collected at each sampling site (i.e., the 3 sub-samples combined, usually Chironomidae) divided by the total number of organisms collected (i.e., ~300 count). % Diptera: The % Diptera was calculated as the sum of all flies collected at each sampling site (i.e., the 3 sub-samples combined) divided by the total number of organisms collected (i.e., ~300 count). % Chironomidae: The % Chironomidae was calculated as the sum of all groups of benthic macroinvertebrates classified as insects that were collected at each sampling site (i.e., the 3 subsamples combined) divided by the total number of organisms collected (i.e., ~300 count). While these are useful tools to summarize benthic macroinvertebrate data, statistical analysis was not performed to determine the significance of any impact since there are many confounding factors involved in field sampling. 2.5. Chloride Monitoring at the Sites of Benthic Macroinvertebrate Sampling This research is part of a larger project that also monitors chloride concentrations at the sites of benthic macroinvertebrate sampling. Conductivity readings were measured continuously and water samples were collected. The water samples were then sent to the University of Waterloo to determine if conductivity measurements were confirmed to be a proxy for chloride concentrations. This data was then compared to benthic macroinvertebrate analysis to determine if any qualitative evaluations can be made between impact to benthic macroinvertebrates and high chloride concentrations.

2.6. Field Collection of Freshwater Biofilms The field component of biofilm collection was conducted by Master of Science student, Tarn Preet Parmar (Ryerson University, 2018), using the following technique: 1. Flat surface tiles (15.24 centimetres x 15.24 centimetres) were submerged in a mesotrophic freshwater pond in southern Ontario near Whitby (3.4.343Â° 59' 58.1892'' N, 79Â° 2' 9.9384'' W) to allow for biofilm surface attachment. Biofilms were grown on flat surface tiles to mimic stones for attachment (Li et al., 2017). 2. Three tiles as replicates (denoted "A", "B", "C") were placed in three different locations in the pond and were inserted at two different depths (0.5 metres and 1.5 meters) using chains attached to pool noodle floats for easy extraction. 3. Biofilms were collected after 67 days following growth during the summer (July 11September 16th/17th/18th and fall season (October 3rd-December 9th/10th/11th) of the 2017 year. 4. Tiles were inserted into plastic Tupperware containers filled with enough pond water to cover the entire sample containing biofilms. 5. The tiles were transferred to a laboratory fridge where they were stored at 4 degrees Celsius and covered with a black garbage back to ensure complete darkness until future use. 2.7. Laboratory Sorting and Culturing of Freshwater Biofilms Culturing techniques of aquatic biofilms vary widely, and considers many factors that include but are not limited to amount of flow, light/dark cycling, and media additions (Berner et al., 2015). There is currently a lack of standardized methodology for culturing aquatic biofilms but it has been recognized that there is a need for a consensus on the ideal protocols (Berner et al., 2015). Collectively, 59

most studies provided a carbon and nitrogen source while culturing the aquatic biofilms (Berner et al., 2015). There are some studies that have used Chu's media to cultivate biofilms containing Botryococcus braunii (Largeau et al., 1980; Berner et al., 2015) which is commonly used in laboratory culturing of freshwater algal species, and was also used for the purposes of this study. 1. The tiles were removed from the fridge, taken out of the plastic Tupperware container and placed on a brown paper towel with the surface containing the biofilms facing up, as shown in Figure 10.

Figure 11. Biofilm growth on tile surface with small section removed.

60

2. Biofilms were removed by scraping (Paule et al., 2015) using a scalpel (Li et al., 2017) after sterilization using 70% ethanol and were then inserted into 50 millilitre Falcon tubes with a plastic screw cap. 3. The Falcon tubes containing the biofilms were stored in a fridge at 4 degrees Celsius while being covered by a black garbage bag to ensure complete darkness until they were ready to be used in laboratory culturing. 4. The Falcon tubes were removed from the fridge and placed on a laboratory benchtop with a nearby Bunsen burner flame for sterilization of surfaces. 5. The growth media for the biofilms included placing the following in separate, 125 millilitre Erlenmeyer flasks: i) ii) iii) iv) three replicates of 10 millilitres of pond water three replicates of 40 millilitres of pond water three replicates of 10 millilitres of Chu's media three replicates of 40 millilitres of Chu's media

6. Each flask was inoculated with 1 millilitre of biofilms taken from the densest part of the summer sample from a tile that was extracted from the 1.25 metre pond depth. 7. The pond water was filtered to remove any biological material that may have had impact on the experiment. 8. The contents of each of the flasks were closed off to the exterior environment with the exception of gas exchange using white foam stoppers. 9. The flasks were placed on a shaker table at a constant rate of 100 revolutions per minute to simulate a natural flow environment under a light bank using 16 hour light cycle and 8 hour dark cycle (Berner et al., 2015). 61

10. It has been shown that it is important to replenish consumed nutrients by adding fresh media periodically (Berner et al., 2015). Hence, 40 millilitres of fresh Chu's media was added to each flask after 3 weeks and 6 weeks following initial culturing. 11. The flasks were randomized on the shaker table regularly (every 24 hours days). The majority of organisms in the biofilm sample prior to culturing consisted of a large proportion of diatoms with some nematoda as well as rotifers, which was determined through the use of taxonomic keys, and a sample image has been provided in Figure 11.

2.8. Laboratory-based Sodium chloride Toxicity Test on Freshwater Biofilms Since protocols for toxicity testing are not currently available for multiple species in an aquatic biofilm consortium, it was decided that for the purposes of this study, the Bottle Test Method for Pseudokirchneriella subcapitatum by the United States Environmental Protection Agency would be implemented since the majority of organisms in the sample were determined to be algal species after culturing the biofilms in Chu's media. However, the duration of this test was 48 hours and was used to determine acute impact with endpoints of cell aggregation (Mahfoud et al., 2009). Measurements of abundance and diversity were attempted; however, due to the challenges of conducting cell counts with biofilm consortiums, abundance was the endpoint measured. A similar toxicity test using the microplate technique for Pseudokirchneriella subcapitatum by Environment Canada was available but was not used since it would be difficult to discern any aggregation within each well of the microplate. Additionally, a massive literature review and references to micrographs were used to identify the phycology of the organisms to the genus level of taxonomy. 2.8.1. Concentrations of NaCl Chosen Chu's nutrient media was used in this test and NaCl was added directly to the media as concentrations of 5.1, 120, 640, and 2759 mg/L which resulted in 3.096, 72.84, 388.5, and 1674.7 mg/L of chloride, respectively. A full list of ingredients for the Chu's media has been provided in the Appendix D. The concentrations of NaCl were chosen to span a range of concentrations that were applicable to the field sites. Sodium chloride (NaCl) was used since it is the most common type of road salt, and was weighed using a scale and added to the Chu's media. NaCl was added to Chu's media in 1L glass bottles with a screw-top lid that had previously been washed and autoclaved. Chu's media with the absence of NaCl was used as the reference condition. The bottles were placed on a stir plate with a 63

magnetic stirrer for 1 minute to ensure that the NaCl had fully dissolved. The magnetic stirrer was removed and the bottles were placed in the dark in a fridge at 4 degrees Celsius until they were ready to be used the next day. 2.8.2. Initiation of Biofilm Toxicity Test 1. The bottles were removed from the fridge and allowed to return to room temperature (21 degrees Celsius) before the test began to ensure cells would not be shocked by the temperature. 2. Five replicates of each NaCl concentration in Chu's media and five replicates of reference condition were placed into 125 Erlenmeyer flasks that had been autoclaved with white foam stoppers (to close the biofilms off from the external environment with the exception of gas exchange), and each flask at a volume of 40 mL. 3. The biofilms inoculum was taken from one of the culture biofilm flasks that had been vigorously shaken to disrupt any aggregation and allow for a homogeneous mixture. The inoculum was taken as a volume of 1 mL to ensure that any aggregation would be visible after 48-hours. 4. The temperature was held at 24+/- 2 degrees Celsius; with a light cycle of 16 hours of light and 8 hours of dark. 5. The light intensity at the water's surface was 60 Âµmol Â· m2 Â· s1. 6. Continuous shaking of the flasks was conducted using a shaker table at 100 revolutions per minute. 2.8.3. 48-hour Assessment of Biofilm Aggregation and Cell Growth 1. After 48-hours, each flask was visually compared to the other flasks to determine the degree of aggregation of the biofilms for each NaCl concentration compared to the reference condition. 64

2. A photograph was taken by a camera to represent the changes that had occurred between the flasks at the different NaCl concentrations and reference condition after being placed adjacent to each other. 3. The biofilms were then observed under a Leica CME light microscope at a volume of 10 ÂµL from the aggregated areas or areas that appeared to have the greatest cell density if no aggregation was observed. 4. Cell counts were attempted; however, it was difficult to discern individual cells due to biofilm aggregation. 5. A qualitative visual assessment was then conducted to compare biofilm aggregation in the NaCl concentrations and in the reference condition. 6. A photograph was also taken of the observed differences at the different NaCl concentrations and the reference condition as visual representations. 7. The flasks were then placed back on the shaker table under the same light and temperature conditions and were then allowed to grow for 7 days to observe any chronic impacts. 2.8.4. 7-day Assessment of Biofilm Aggregation and Cell Growth 1. After 7-days, the process for observing cells in flasks at the different NaCl concentrations compared to the reference condition as well as the visual observation under a Leica CME light microscope for both aggregated areas and after being vigorously shaken, was repeated. 2. The endpoint of aggregation was again evaluated as a qualitative visual assessment with visual representations using photographs. 3. As well, any discernable differences in cell diversity were recorded.

3.0. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1. Overall Distribution of Benthic Macroinvertebrates at Sampling Sites The following results and discussion consider the many interacting and contributing factors that may have affected the abundance, diversity, and presence or absence of key indicator benthic macroinvertebrates. Along with elevated chloride concentrations, other factors include the presence of additional urban contaminants seasonality, niche variables, as well as the feeding strategies of these organisms. The potentially cumulative impact that these factors can have on benthic macroinvertebrate communities make it challenging to isolate the relative influence of individual variables outside of the laboratory. This limitation is considered for each sampling site below. Other limitations that were experienced throughout this study are identified and the future directions of this research are explained. 3.2. Abundance and Diversity of Benthic Macroinvertebrates at each Sampling Site As mentioned previously, the upstream sampling sites were expected to have a higher abundance and diversity than the downstream sampling sites at each location. Hence, the upstream sampling sites are listed first and are followed by the corresponding downstream sampling sites for all seasons. At each site, the abundance and diversity as well as the presence or absence of key indicator organisms are discussed. Abundance was the number of benthic macroinvertebrates collected at each subsampling site based on the total number of organisms picked in the sample and were summed as two riffles and one pool to obtain a larger sample size (Jones et al., 2007; pers. comm. Chris Jones, 2018) that is representative of each subsampling site (i.e., Total abundance for Matheson Creek upstream site (Matheson Creek Upstream (UP_MAT)) = abundance Matheson Creek Upstream (UP_MAT) (riffle 1) + abundance Matheson Creek Upstream (UP_MAT) (pool) + abundance Matheson 66

Creek Upstream (UP_MAT) (riffle 2). Diversity was the number of different benthic macroinvertebrate groups present within the total organisms that were sampled and was averaged as two riffles and one pool to obtain a larger sample size (Jones et al., 2007; pers. comm. Chris Jones, 2018) that is representative of each subsampling site (i.e., Total diversity for Matheson Creek upstream site (UPMAT) = [(number of groups Matheson Creek Upstream (UP_MAT) (riffle 1) + number of groups Matheson Creek Upstream (UP_MAT) (pool) + number of groups Matheson Creek Upstream (UP_MAT) (riffle 2))/3]. The interacting and contributing factors, as well as the concentrations of chloride that could have affected the abundance and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates, are discussed. It must be noted that there may have been some peaks in chloride concentration that exceeded or fell below the range that is reported in this thesis since the samples were not taken as continuous readings and were instead taken as grab samples. The organization of the benthic macroinvertebrate results are shown in Figure 13.

Figure 13. Flow diagram of the organization of benthic macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity results. 3.2.1. Trends in Benthic Macroinvertebrates at the Willow Creek Upstream (UP_WIL) Site: The benthic macroinvertebrate data for this site has been provided for summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017 in Figure 13, Figure, 14, Figure, 15, and Figure 16. This upstream sampling site had a relatively higher diversity in all seasons surveyed with the taxonomic richness of 11.0, 10.7, 12.0, and 10.7, respectively. In general this upstream sampling site had a relatively lower abundance in summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017 of 262, 314, 202, and 333, respectively. The largest proportion of benthic macroinvertebrates was generally Chironomidae, which is considered to be pollution-tolerant (% Chironomidae of 40.0, 35.9, 25.5, and 18.9). These organisms 68

were expected to be the most abundant benthic macroinvertebrates (Pinder, 1986; Lindegaard, 1995; Gerecke et al., 1998; Chris Jones, pers. comm., 2016). However, they were also found to be present along with a large proportion of Trichoptera or Ephemeroptera, which are pollution-sensitive organisms (% EPT of 31.3, 36.9, 36.4, and 55.3). The abundance of both pollution -tolerant and -sensitive organisms at this site may be indicative of a healthy ecosystem (Poff et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2007). The higher proportion of Ephemeroptera in the fall than the spring may be attributed to the peak emergence period for these insects (Merritt & Cummins, 1996; Jones et al., 2007). In the summer months of both years, there were lower proportions of Ephemeroptera, which may be attributed to their low tolerance to reduced dissolved oxygen along with higher temperatures that create stressful conditions for these organisms (Peckarsky et al., 1990; Poff et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2007; Alhejoj et al., 2014). It should also be noted that Chironomidae show their lowest proportion in September (Jones et al., 2007), which is consistent with the results collected from the fall in this study. This site was also observed to have leaf litter and woody debris, which can be used as food resources for benthic macroinvcertebrates, particularly shredders (Cummins & Klug, 1979; Merritt & Cummings, 1996; Vannote et al., 1980). As well, this site contained rocky substrate, which is favourable for all organisms (Merritt & Cummings, 1996). Both of these factors are expected to provide suitable habit conditions for many benthic macroinvertebrates. Finally, the concentration of chloride that was collected during the 2016 year ranged between 9.9-34.6 mg/L, which is far below the CCME acute (640 mg/L) and chronic guidelines and hence was not expected to have a toxicological impact on organisms at this site.

Trends in Benthic Macroinvertebrates at the Willow Creek Downstream (MID_WIL) Site: The benthic macroinvertebrate data for this site has been provided below for summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017 in Figure 17, Figure, 18, Figure, 19, and Figure 20. This 73

downstream sampling site had a diversity in summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017 of 8.00, 9.00, 9.00, and 9.33, respectively. In general, this downstream sampling site had an abundance in summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017 of 306, 319, 307, and 318, respectively. A large proportion of the sampled benthic macroinvertebrates were some of the most pollution-sensitive organisms, namely Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (% EPTs of 59.3, 57.8, 45.7, and 71.4, respectively). The other groups of benthic macroinvertebrates were in low abundance when compared to the proportions of the three indicator organisms listed above. This could explain the low abundance of predator species, such as Anisoptera, that require an environment that can support a variety of prey species. As well, the reduced number of Chironomidae in fall 2017 is consistent with the expected results of their lowest percentage in September (% Chironomidae of 4.77, 32.2, 17.8, and 19.1 in Summer 2016, Spring 2017, Summer 2017, and Fall 2017, respectively) (Jones et al., 2007). However, a very low proportion of Chironomidae in combination with the high proportion of pollution-sensitive organisms may be indicative of a healthier aquatic ecosystem (Poff et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2007). This site was expected to have poor water quality relative to the upstream reference sites due to runoff inputs from a small urban community located between it and the upstream site. In turn, this was expected to result in lower abundance and diversity; however, this site was shown to have a high proportion of pollution sensitive-organisms and low proportion of pollution-tolerant organisms, which may be indicative of a healthy aquatic ecosystem (Peckarsky et al., 1990; Poff et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2007; Alhejoj et al., 2014). This site was also noted to have woody debris that can be used as a food resource for shredders in particular (Cummins & Klug, 1979; Merritt & Cummings, 1996; Vannote et al., 1980). As well, this site contained a relatively higher water velocity, which could have provided a higher dissolved oxygen content and thus would be supportive of many aquatic organisms. The concentration of chloride that was collected during the 2016 year ranged between 27.5-69.8 mg/L, 74

which was also far below the CCME acute and chronic guidelines.

3.2.3. Trends in Benthic Macroinvertebrates at the Matheson Creek Upstream (UP_MAT) Site The benthic macroinvertebrate data for this site has been provided below for summer 2016, 78

spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017 in Figure 21, Figure, 22, Figure, 23, and Figure 24. In general, this upstream sampling site had a diversity in summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017 of 11.0, 10.7, 9.00, and 11.0, respectively. This site also had an abundance summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017 of 153, 304, 231, and 302, respectively. This was not consistent with the expected results. This upstream sampling site of Matheson Creek is considered to be one of the sites furthest away from anthropogenic sources of contaminants and was expected to show high abundance and diversity compared to downstream sites or sites containing many potential sources of contaminants. However, this site showed a high proportion of Chironomidae (31.7, 65.0, 65.3, and 59.3 for summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017, respectively), which are pollutiontolerant benthic macroinvertebrates and are expected to be the most abundant at sites (Pinder, 1986; Lindegaard, 1995; Gerecke et al., 1998; Chris Jones, pers. comm., 2016). In combination with the proportion of Oligochaeta (2.10, 0.99, 1.88, and 1.98 for summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017, respectively), there was a large proportion of pollution-tolerant organisms that may imply that the water quality was reduced or that contaminants were present. However, there were a variety of other organisms present, such as Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera or Plecoptera (% EPTs 25.8, 5.83, 13.3, and 8.94 for summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017, respectively) that also occupy this site. This site was also noted to have leaf litter that can be used as a food resource for shredders in particular and may have increased the number of Plecoptera (stoneflies) for instance (Cummins & Klug, 1979; Merritt & Cummings, 1996; Vannote et al., 1980). However, sandy substrate was the dominant at this site, which is unfavourable for benthic macroinvertebrates; hence, this may have contributed to the low abundance and diversity of these organisms (Merritt & Cummings, 1996). The concentration of chloride that was collected during the 2016 year ranged between 3.096-14.5 mg/L, which were some of the lowest readings that were collected compared to all other sites and was 79

also far below the CCME acute and chronic guidelines.

3.2.4. Trends in Benthic Macroinvertebrates at the Matheson Creek Downstream (LOW_MAT) Site The benthic macroinvertebrate data for this site has been provided below for summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017 in Figure 25, Figure, 26, Figure, 27, and Figure 28. In general, this downstream sampling site had a diversity of 10.7, 10.0, 12.7, and 12.0 in summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017, respectively. This downstream sampling site had an abundance of 223, 268, 266, and 311 in summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017, respectively. This site was located directly adjacent to a farm that may have contributed to some contaminants entering into the stream. The large proportion of pollution-tolerant organisms, namely Chironomidae (39.7, 59.1, 32.6, and 51.9 for summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017, respectively) was expected since these organisms are often the most abundant at sites (Pinder, 1986; Lindegaard, 1995; Gerecke et al., 1998; Chris Jones, pers. comm., 2016). In combination with Oligochaeta (7.33, 8.24, 9.64, and 10.6 for summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017, respectively), there was a large proportion of pollution-tolerant organisms which may suggest this site has been negatively impacted by contaminants. However, pollution-sensitive organisms, namely Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, and Plecoptera (% EPTs of 19.67, 5.83, 23.2, and 16.9 for summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017, respectively) were present during all seasons. Hence, the combination of pollution Â­tolerant and -sensitive benthic macroinvertebrates may be indicative of an environment that can support a variety of organisms (Poff et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2007). The most stressful month, namely summer, was shown to have many different groups (diversity) being indicative of a habitat that is able to support many organism groups. This may also explain the presence of a number of predator organisms, namely Anisoptera and Zygoptera, which require an ecosystem that can support many prey species. This site was low in woody debris and detritus in most areas which can be 84

used as resources (De Lange, 1994; Merritt & Cummings, 1996); however, there was also sandy substrate, which is unfavourable for benthic macroinvertebrates and may have contributed to some reductions in abundance and diversity (Merritt & Cummings, 1996). The concentration of chloride that was collected during the 2016 year ranged between 22.0-33.0 mg/L, which was far below the CCME acute and chronic guidelines.

3.2.5. Trends in Benthic Macroinvertebrates at the East Holland River Upstream (UP_EH) Site The benthic macroinvertebrate data for this site has been provided below for summer 2016, 89

spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017 in Figure 29, Figure, 30, Figure, 31, and Figure 32.This upstream sampling site had a good diversity in summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017 with the taxonomic richness of 9.0, 10.0, 11.3, and 12.3, respectively. This site also varied in abundance during the summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017 seasons, which were determined to be 288, 315, 240, and 320, respectively. This site was positioned directly beside a residential neighbourhood, and the stream may have been subjected to a variety of domestic-use contaminants. However, this site contained a relatively low proportion of pollution-tolerant Chironomidae compared to many other sites (% Chironomidae of 6.68, 20.5, 30.4, and 20.7 in summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017, respectively). As well, there was a high proportion of pollution-sensitive organisms with Plecoptera, Ephemeroptera, and Trichoptera (% EPTs of 59.5, 5.83, 48.2, and 61.3 in summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017, respectively) present during all seasons. In combination, a reduced proportion of pollution-tolerant organisms and an increased proportion of pollution-sensitive organisms may be an indication of good ecosystem health and water quality (Poff et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2007). This site was also noted to have woody debris present, which can be used as a food resource, particularly for shredder organisms (Cummins & Klug, 1979; Merritt & Cummings, 1996; Vannote et al., 1980). As well, this site contained rocky substrate which is favourable for benthic macroinvertebrates (Merritt & Cummings, 1996). Also, the concentration of chloride that was collected during the 2016 year ranged between 34.0-245.6 mg/L, which exceeded the CCME chronic guidelines.

Figure 33. Benthic macroinvertebrate identification at the East Holland River Upstream (UP_EH) sampling site fall 2017. 3.2.6. Trends in Benthic Macroinvertebrates at the East Holland River Downstream (MID_EH) Site The benthic macroinvertebrate data for this site has been provided below for summer 2016, 94

spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017 in Figure 33, Figure, 34, Figure, 35, and Figure 36. This site is the most downstream sampling area of the East Holland River that was expected to show the most negative impacts of all sampling sites, particularly due to its close proximity to urbanization; hence, it was expected to receive the highest inputs of road salt. This site varied in comparison to the upstream site in diversity during summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017 with the taxonomic richness of 10.0, 12.7, 8.7, and 10.7, respectively. In general, this downstream sampling site varied in abundance during summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017 which was determined to be 288, 317, 311, and 314, respectively. This site was confirmed to have the highest concentration of chloride of all sites from the samples that were evaluated. As well, there is a large proportion of pollution-tolerant organisms, predominantly Chironomidae (53.7, 40.0, 68.9, and 72.6, respectively) and Oligochaeta (5.29, 2.26, 10.3, and 6.37, respectively), that may be present due to their ability to withstand the contaminants that could be present in the area. However, pollution-sensitive organisms were present in low proportions (% EPTs 7.63, 5.83, 5.73, and 6.10, respectively), which may be indicative of reduced water quality or the presence of contaminants (Peckarsky et al., 1990; Poff et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2007; Alhejoj et al., 2014). This was especially apparent during the summer months, which is not only the most stressful season, but also the season that many of the benthic macroinvertebrate insects emerge (Merritt & Cummings, 1996; Jones et al., 2007). Also, many of these organisms were present in lower proportions in the fall when they are generally expected to increase in proportions, namely Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera. This may be attributed to the hindered ability to replenish populations following the reduced numbers of organisms due stressful summer months or it could even be attributed to another factor, such as early applications on road salts that entered the watershed. As well, diversity was also generally low at this site which is often correlated with unhealthy aquatic ecosystems or environments that do not support a variety of organisms. This site was 95

also noted to have leaf litter present in some areas for use as food resources, which is particularly important for shredder organisms (Cummins & Klug, 1979; Merritt & Cummings, 1996; Vannote et al. 1980). However, this site consisted of mainly sandy substrate, which is unfavourable for all benthic macroinvertebrates. The concentration of chloride that was collected during the 2016 year ranged between 104.4-1674.7.0 mg/L, which was the highest of all sampling sites and far exceeded the CCME acute and chronic guidelines; however, there may have been some peaks in chloride concentration that exceeded or fell below this range since this was not conducted as a continuous reading.

3.2.7. Trends in Benthic Macroinvertebrates at the East Holland River Upstream_Hwy 404 (UP_404) Site: The benthic macroinvertebrate data for this site has been provided below for summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017 in Figure 37, Figure, 38, Figure, 39, and Figure 40. This upstream sampling site had a high diversity in summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017 with the taxonomic richness of 10.0, 6.67, 8.33, and 7.67, respectively. In general, this upstream sampling site had a relatively lower abundance in summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017 of 297, 339, 242, and 313, respectively. The proportion of Chironomidae was generally low (1.31 %, 10.5 %, 19.3 %, and 28.6 %, for summer 2016, Spring 2017, summer 2017, and respectively). However, the proportion of sensitive organisms was generally high, namely Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera (% EPTs 16.7, 50.4, 36.7, and 20.0, respectively). This may have been attributed to a high dissolved oxygen content due to the faster-moving waters (Peckarsky et al., 1990; Poff et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2007; Alhejoj et al., 2014). This site also consisted of gravel and stone substrates, which are among the most favourable substrate types for benthic macroinvertebrates (Merritt & Cummings, 1996). As well, the concentration of chloride that was collected during the 2016 year ranged between 43.6- 86.2 mg/L, which was below the CCME acute and chronic guidelines.

3.2.8. Trends in Benthic Macroinvertebrates at the East Holland River Downstream_Hwy 404 (DOWN_404) Site The benthic macroinvertebrate data for this site has been provided below for summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017 in Figure 42, Figure, 43, Figure, 44, and Figure 45. In general, this downstream sampling site had a high diversity in summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017 with the taxonomic richness of 9.67, 10.7, 9.00, and 11.0, respectively. In general, this downstream sampling site had a high abundance in summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2017 which was determined to be 379, 329, 247, and 319, respectively. This site showed a very low proportion of Chironomidae compared to many other sampling sites (19.5, 47.8, 24.9, and 25.3 for summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2018, respectively) which may be indicative of a healthier aquatic ecosystem proportion since Chironomidae are expected to be in high abundance at contaminated sites with low water quality. As well, there is a large proportion of pollution-tolerant organisms, such as Trichoptera, at this site (% EPTs of 10.6, 30.3, 43.1, and 52.9 for summer 2016, spring 2017, summer 2017, and fall 2018, respectively). This may have been attributed to the rocky substrate as well as the woody debris that these organisms commonly use as food sources and for building casings as a place for refuge (De Lange, 1994; Jones et al., 2007). It was speculated that the stream also contained a higher dissolved oxygen content due to the replenishment of oxygen through faster moving water that provides a habitat suitable for pollution-sensitive organisms (Peckarsky et al., 1990; Poff et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2007; Alhejoj et al., 2014). The concentration of chloride that was collected during the 2016 year ranged between 50.0-77.1 mg/L, which was below the CCME acute and chronic guidelines. Additionally, this site is located in close proximity to a golf course and may have been subjected to a variety of contaminants; however, the benthic macroinvertebrates did not indicate impaired aquatic ecosystem health. 106

3.3. Biological Indices for Assessment of Aquatic Ecosystem Health at Sampling Sites The biological indices for the sampling sites during summer 2016 have been provided in Table 3. The highest number of groups (diversity) occurred with the reference sites of the least urbanized areas, namely Willow Creek upstream (UP-WIL) and Matheson Creek Upstream (UP_MAT) sites, which were determined to be 11.0 and 11.0, respectively. This may be indicative of healthier aquatic ecosystems that are able to support a variety of organisms in these areas. The mean percent EPTs was shown to be lowest at the most urbanized site, namely the East Holland River Downstream (MID_EH) site, which was determined to be 7.63%. Since EPTs are pollution-sensitive organisms, it is expected that a lower number may be indicative of reduced aquatic ecosystem health in this area. The mean percent Chironomidae was shown to be highest at the most urbanized site, namely the East Holland River Downstream (MID_EH) site, which was determined to be 53.7%. The mean percent Oligochaeta was shown to be highest at test sites with one of them being the most urbanized site, which are the Matheson Creek Downstream (LOW_MAT) site and the East Holland River Downstream (MID_EH), which was determined to be 7.33 and 5.29, respectively. However, the percent Oligochaeta were not shown to be a high percentage of the total benthic macroinvertebrates sampled at these sites. Additionally, the mean percent Dominants were often the same as the percent Chironomidae since these organisms are known to be the most widely distributed and abundant at sites, which was consistent for Willow Creek Upstream (UP_WIL), Matheson Creek Upstream (UP_MAT), Matheson Creek Downstream (LOW_MAT), and the East Holland River Downstream (MID_EH) sites. Also, a lower percent Dominants may be representative of better aquatic ecosystem health since it may imply that there is a good ratio of the most dominant organisms to the rest of the benthic macroinvertebrate groups. This may be true for the sites which had the lowest percent Dominants, namely Willow Creek 111

Downstream (MID_WIL), Matheson Creek Upstream (UP_MAT), and East Holland River_Hwy 404 Downstream (DOWN_4O4) which were determined to be 25.2 %, 31.7 %, and 33.5 %. The mean percent Insects was generally highest at the upstream sites, namely the Willow Creek Upstream (UP_WIL), Matheson Creek Upstream (UP_MAT), and East Holland River Upstream (UP_EH) sites, which may be indicative of healthier aquatic ecosystems at these sites.

The biological indices for all sites during spring 2017 have been summarized in Table 4. The highest number of groups (diversity) occurred at most urbanized area, namely the East Holland River 112

Downstream (MID_EH) site, which were determined to be 12.7. This may be indicative of healthier aquatic ecosystems that are able to support a variety of organisms in these areas, which was not consistent with the expected result for this test site. However, this site had a low percent EPTs (5.83 %), and generally high percent Chironomidae (40 %). The mean percent EPTs was shown to be highest at the upstream sites or sites with low urbanization, namely the Willow Creek Upstream (UP_WIL), Willow Creek Downstream (MID_WIL), East Holland River Upstream_HWY 404 (UP_404), and East Holland River Downstream (MID_EH) sites, which were determined to be 36.9 %, 57.8 %, 50.37 %, and 47.8 %, respectively. Since EPTs are pollution-sensitive organisms, it would be expected that a higher number may be indicative of good aquatic ecosystem health in these areas. The mean percent Chironomidae was shown to be high at test sites including the most urbanized site, namely the Matheson Creek Downstream (LOW_MAT), and the East Holland River Downstream (MID_EH) site, which were determined to be 59.1 % and 40.0 %, respectively. This was consistent with the expected results in these areas since Chironomidae are pollution tolerant, and a higher number may be indicative of the presence of contaminants and/or reduced aquatic ecosystem health. However, it was discovered that one of the least urbanized reference sites, which was Matheson Creek Upstream (UP_MAT) site, also had the highest percent Oligochaeta (8.24 %), which is also a pollution-tolerant organism and may be indicative of reduced aquatic ecosystem health. However, the percent Oligochaeta was in a low proportion to the total benthic macroinvertebrates sampled at these sites. The mean percent Dominants were often the same as the percent Chironomidae since these organisms are known to be the most widely distributed and abundant at sites, which was consistent for Willow Creek Upstream (UP_WIL), Willow Creek Downstream (DOWN_WIL), Matheson Creek Upstream (UP_MAT), Matheson Creek Downstream (LOW_MAT), and the East Holland River Downstream (MID_EH) sites. Also, a lower percent Dominants may be representative of better aquatic ecosystem health since it may imply that 113

there is a good ratio of the most dominant benthic macroinvertebrate group to the rest of the organisms. This may be true for the sites which have the lowest percent Dominants, namely the East Holland River_Hwy 404 Downstream (DOWN_4O4), which was determined to be 29.3 %. The mean percent Insects was generally highest at the upstream sites and sites with low urbanization, namely the Willow Creek Upstream (UP_WIL), Willow Creek Downstream (DOWN_WIL), Matheson Creek Upstream (UP_MAT), Matheson Creek Downstream (LOW_MAT), and the East Holland River Downstream (MID_EH) sites, which were determined to be 81.2 %, 98.8 %, 81.8 %, 81.2 %, and 88.7 %, respectively. A higher percent Insects may be indicative of healthier aquatic ecosystems at these sites, which was consistent with the expected results, aside from the East Holland River Downstream (MID_EH) site.

The biological indices for all sites during summer 2017 have been summarized in Table 5. The highest number of groups (diversity) occurred at some of the least urbanized areas, both reference and test sites, namely Willow Creek upstream (UP-WIL) and Matheson Creek Downstream (LOW_MAT) sites, which were determined to be 12.0 and 12.7, respectively. This may be indicative of healthier aquatic ecosystems that are able to support a variety of organisms in these areas. The mean percent 115

EPTs was shown to be lowest at the most urbanized site, namely the East Holland River Downstream (MID_EH) site, which was determined to be 5.73%. Since EPTs are pollution-sensitive organisms, it would be expected that a lower number would be indicative of the presence of contaminants and/or reduced aquatic ecosystem health in this area. The mean percent Chironomidae was shown to be highest at the most urbanized site, namely the East Holland River Downstream (MID_EH) site, which was determined to be 53.7%. A higher percent Chironomidae may be indicative of reduced aquatic ecosystem health in this area. The mean percent Oligochaeta was shown to be highest at test sites and one of them being the most urbanized site, namely the Matheson Creek Downstream (LOW_MAT) and the East Holland River Downstream (MID_EH) site being the latter, which were determined to be 9.64 % and 10.3 %, respectively. However, the percent Oligochaeta were not in high proportion to the total benthic macroinvertebrates sampled at these sites. The mean percent Dominants were often the same as the percent Chironomidae since these organisms are known to be the most widely distributed and abundant at sites, which was consistent for Willow Creek Downstream (MID_WIL), Matheson Creek Upstream (UP_MAT), Matheson Creek Downstream (LOW_MAT), and the East Holland River Downstream (MID_EH) sites. Also, a lower percent Dominants may be representative of better aquatic ecosystem health since it may imply that there is a good ratio of the most dominant organism to the rest of the organisms. This may be true for the sites which have the lowest percent Dominants, namely Willow Creek Downstream (MID_WIL), and East Holland River_Hwy 404 Downstream (DOWN_4O4) which were determined to be 17.8 %, and 17.2 %. The mean percent Insects was generally high at most sites, except for the Willow Creek Upstream (UP_WIL) site, which was determined to be 4.78. A lower percent Insects may be indicative of reduced aquatic ecosystem health, which was not consistent with the expected result at this site.

The biological indices for all sites during fall 2017 have been summarized in Table 6. The highest number of groups (diversity) occurred with at reference sites or areas with lower urbanization, namely the Matheson Creek Downstream (LOW_MAT) site and East Holland River Upstream sites (UP_EH), which were determined to be 12.0 and 12.3, respectively. This may be indicative of healthier aquatic ecosystems that are able to support a variety of organisms in these areas. The mean percent EPTs was shown to be lowest at the most urbanized site, namely the East Holland River Downstream (MID_EH) 117

site, which was determined to be 6.10 %. Since EPTs are pollution-sensitive organisms, it would be expected that a lower number would be indicative of the presence of contaminants and/or reduced aquatic ecosystem health in this area. The mean percent Chironomidae was shown to be highest at the most urbanized site, namely the East Holland River Downstream (MID_EH) site, which was determined to be 72.6 %. The mean percent Oligochaeta was shown to be highest at test sites and one of them being the most urbanized site, namely the Matheson Creek Downstream (LOW_MAT) and the East Holland River Downstream (MID_EH) site being the latter, which was determined to be 10.6 % and 6.37 %, respectively. However, the percent Oligochaeta were not in a high proportion to the total benthic macroinvertebrates sampled at these sites. The mean percent Dominants were often the same as the percent Chironomidae since these organisms are known to be the most widely distributed and abundant at sites, which was consistent for Matheson Creek Upstream (UP_MAT), Matheson Creek Downstream (LOW_MAT), East Holland River Downstream (MID_EH), and East Holland River_Hwy 404 (UP_404) sites. Also, a lower percent Dominants may be representative of better aquatic ecosystem health since it may imply that there is a good ratio of the most dominant organism to the rest of the organisms. This may be true for the site which has the lowest percent Dominants, namely the East Holland River_Hwy 404 Downstream (DOWN_4O4) which was determined to be 25.9 %. The mean percent Insects was generally high at all sites, which may be indicative of healthier aquatic ecosystems at these sites.

3.4. 48-hour Laboratory Toxicity Test of Sodium chloride on Freshwater Biofilms After 48 hours following inoculation of biofilms in reference condition, 5.1 mg/L NaCl (3.096 mg/L Chloride), 120 mg/L NaCl (72.84 mg/L Chloride), 640 mg/L NaCl (388.5 mg/L Chloride), and 2759 mg/L NaCl (1674.7 mg/L Chloride) concentrations, there was a visible change in cell growth and degree of aggregation between the different salt concentrations, as shown in Figure 44. Upon visual inspection, the biofilms in reference condition and at the low salt concentration of 5.1mg/L had a greater amount of cell growth with minimal cell aggregation. At the 120 mg/L NaCl concentration, the biofilms were starting to show a reduction in cell growth and an increase of aggregation. At the 640 mg/L NaCl concentration, the biofilms were showing a reduction in cell growth along with a higher degree of aggregation. At the highest NaCl concentration of 2759 mg/L, the biofilms were showing the greatest reduction in cell growth as well as the highest degree of aggregation.

3.4.1. Biofilms in the Reference Condition after 48 Hours After 48 hours following inoculation of the biofilms in Chu's nutrient media, the reference condition showed the highest abundance of cells and the most diversity in species, as shown in Figure 45. The majority of cells were circular-shaped, green algal cells, which were suspected to belong to Chlorella sp. There were also diatoms such as Navicula sp., a variety of Protista, Scenedesmus sp., Raphidocelis sp., and filamentous algae (i.e., Mougeotia sp.). Following vigorous shaking of the reference condition flasks, it was recognized that the biofilms were similar to samples taken from aggregated areas in the reference condition.

122

3.4.2. Biofilms in the 5.1 mg/L NaCl (3.096 mg/L Chloride) Condition after 48 Hours The biofilms in 5.1 mg/L of NaCl were similar to the biofilms in reference condition, as there were no discernable differences noticed between the two conditions, even after vigorous shaking of the flasks. The abundance and diversity were also found to be high in the 5.1 mg/L NaCl condition, as shown in Figure 46. Chlorella sp., Scenedesmus sp., filamentous algae, Navicula sp., and Protista were found to be present in the 5.1 mg/L NaCl condition, similarly to the reference condition.

3.4.3. Biofilms in the 120 mg/L NaCl (72.84 mg/L Cl) Condition after 48 Hours The biofilms in the 120 mg/L NaCl (i.e., 72.84 mg/L Cl) showed a decrease in the abundance and diversity of organisms compared to the reference condition, as shown in Figure 47. Cells began to aggregate to a greater degree, even after vigorous shaking. Impacts were beginning to be seen after just 123

48-hours following inoculation. While some Scenedesmus sp., Navicula sp., and Protista were present at this concentration of NaCl, they were less abundance than the reference and 5.1 mg/L NaCl (or 3.096 mg/L of Cl) conditions. These flasks were starting to be dominated by Chlorella sp., and filamentous algae. Cells also maintained some of their aggregations following vigorous shaking of the flasks.

124

3.4.4. Biofilms in the 640 mg/L NaCl (388.5 mg/L Cl) Condition after 48 Hours The biofilms in the 640 mg/L NaCl (388.5 mg/L Cl) were shown to have a lower abundance and diversity than the reference conditions and other, lower concentrations of NaCl, as shown in Figure 48. Chlorella sp., diatoms, and (to a lesser degree) filamentous algae, were the dominant organisms present in the biofilms. This may have been attributed to the ability of Chlorella sp. to dominate in stressful environmental conditions due to their thick cell wall and the action of a variety of enzymes (Venancio et al., 2017). As well, diatoms may have still been present due to impacts being shown at very high concentrations that exceed the 640 mg/L NaCl (or 388.5 mg/L Cl condition) (i.e., Nitzschia laevis, was found to be alive at a concentration of 40,000 mg/L, but with severe growth inhibition) (Chen et al., 2008). However, it was also difficult to determine if the diatoms were alive and may have required further investigation using advanced technologies for example. Also, Protista were not observed to be present at this concentration of NaCl. The cells often remained in tight aggregations, even following vigorous shaking.

Biofilms in the 2759 mg/L NaCl (1674.7.0 mg/L Cl) Condition after 48 Hours The biofilms in the 2759 mg/L NaCl (i.e., 1674.7.0 mg/L Cl) condition showed the greatest impact in aggregation, abundance, and diversity compared to the reference conditions and all other NaCl investigated in this study. There were far fewer cells, and some cell death indicated by the brown coloration of some algal cells, as shown in Figure 49. Protista were not observed to be present at this concentration of NaCl and these samples appeared to be dominated by Chlorella sp., and diatoms. As mentioned previously, this may have been attributed to the ability for Chlorella sp. and diatoms to survive in unfavorable environmental conditions due the resilient properties of their thick cell wall and cell wall made out of silica, respectively (Venancio et al., 2017). The cells at this concentration of NaCl also remained in tight aggregations following vigorous shaking. 126

3.5. 7-day Laboratory Toxicity Test of Sodium chloride on Freshwater Biofilms After 7 days following inoculation of biofilms in reference condition, and 5.1, 120, 640, and 2759 mg/L NaCl (i.e., 3.096 mg/L, 72.84 mg/L, 388.5 mg/L, and 1674.7 mg/L Chloride) concentrations, respectively, there was a visible change in cell growth and degree of aggregation between the different salt concentrations. Upon visual inspection, the biofilms in reference condition and at the low salt concentration of 5.1 mg/L NaCl (i.e., 3.096 mg/L Chloride) had a greater amount of cell growth with minimal cell aggregation. At the 120 mg/L NaCl (i.e., 72.84 mg/L Chloride) concentration, the biofilms were starting to show a reduction in cell growth and an increase of aggregation. At the 640 mg/L NaCl (i.e., 388.5 mg/L Chloride) concentration, the biofilms were showing a reduction in cell growth along with a higher degree of aggregation. At the highest NaCl concentration of 2759 mg/L NaCl (i.e., 1674 mg/L Chloride), the biofilms were showing the greatest reduction in cell growth as well as the highest degree of aggregation. This was consistent between all replicates, and a visual sample of these observations has been provided in Figure 50.

Biofilms in the Reference Condition after 7 Days After viewing the biofilms under a Leica light microscope at the termination of the 7-day toxicity test, the reference samples had a high abundance and diversity of organisms, as shown in Figure 51. This was especially prevalent following vigorous shaking of the flasks. There were many cells that were growing in the reference condition, which was expected due to the favorable environmental conditions with the plentiful nutrient medium that was provided along with the absence of contaminants. It was observed that many circular-shaped, green algal species (i.e., Chlorella sp.) and filamentous algal species (i.e., Mougeotia sp.) as well as Euglena sp., Scenedesmus sp., Raphidocelis sp., and diatoms (i.e., Navicula sp.) were prevalent in the reference condition.

Biofilms in the 5.1 mg/L NaCl (3.096 mg/L Chloride) Condition after 7 Days The biofilms in the 5.1 mg/L NaCl (i.e., 3.096 mg/L Chloride) concentration had a high abundance and diversity, as shown in Figure 52. Similarly to the reference condition, some of the biofilm remained attached following vigorous shaking. There were many cells that were observed to be growing, which can be attributed to the favorable environmental conditions that were provided along with the low salt concentration and a plentiful supply of nutrient medium. The circular-shaped, green algal species (i.e., Chlorella sp.) and filamentous algal species (i.e., Mougeotia sp.) were also abundant, similarly to the reference condition. It was also recognized that Raphidocelis sp., Scenedesmus sp. and diatoms were present at this salt concentration. Overall, a difference in abundance, diversity and degree of aggregation between the reference condition and the 5.1 mg/L NaCl condition was not identifiable. 130

3.5.3. Biofilms in the 120 mg/L NaCl (72.84 mg/L Chloride) Condition after 7 Days The biofilms in the 120 mg/L NaCl (i.e., 72.84 mg/L Chloride) samples had a slightly reduced abundance compared to the reference condition, which was expected since salt is known to reduce biofilm growth which is consistent with the high NaCl samples (Mahfoud et al., 2009). Similarly to the reference condition, some of the biofilm remained attached following vigorous shaking. The cells were observed to be growing; however, at a reduced rate than the biofilms in 5.1 mg/L NaCl condition. The circular-shaped, green algal species Chlorella sp. and filamentous algal species Mougeotia sp. were also present, which was similar to the reference condition. Overall, there were a slight reduction in algal growth in the 120 mg/L NaCl condition compared to the reference condition, as shown in Figure 53. 131

Figure 54. Microscope image of freshwater biofilm in the 120 mg/L NaCl (72.84 mg/L Cl) condition under 40X magnification from aggregated sample. 3.5.4. Biofilms in the 640 mg/L NaCl (388.5 mg/L Chloride) Condition after 7 Days The biofilms in the 640 mg/L NaCl (i.e., 388.5 mg/L Chloride) concentration had noticeably reduced abundance compared to the reference condition and had fewer cells than the 5.1 and 120 mg/L NaCl concentrations, as shown in Figure 54. As mentioned previously, salt is known to reduce biofilm growth, which is consistent with the reduced growth of the biofilms at the 640 mg/L NaCl samples (Mahfoud et al., 2009). The biofilms remained attached in tight aggregations, even after vigorous shaking. The circular-shaped, green algal species (i.e., Chlorella sp.) and filamentous algal species (i.e., Mougeotia sp.) were present, along with some diatoms (i.e., Navicula sp.). However, there appeared to be dominance by Chlorella sp. which may be attributed to the ability of Chlorella sp. to dominate in stressful environmental conditions due to its possession of a thick cell wall and activity of several enzymes that make them particularly resilient to contaminants such as salt (Venancio et al., 2017). 132

Also, it may take much higher concentrations of NaCl to result in toxicity of the Chlorella species (CCME, 2011). The CCME document (2011) on Chloride suggests that species of Chlorella sp. show impact at concentrations above 6000 mg/L (6,066 mg/L for Chlorella minutissimo and Chlorella zofingiensis and 6,824 mg/L for Chlorella emersonii). Diatoms were also present at the 640 mg/L NaCl concentration, which may have been attributed to their possession of a silica cell wall as protection from stressful conditions. One species of diatom, Nitzschia laevis, was found to be alive at a concentration of 40,000 mg/L, but with severe growth inhibition (Chen et al., 2008). This concentration far exceeded the highest concentration of salt in this study. Overall, there were a noticeable difference in abundance, diversity and degree of aggregation between the reference condition and the 640 mg/L NaCl condition.

133

Figure 55. Microscope image of freshwater biofilm in the 388.5 mg/L NaCl condition under 40X magnification from aggregated sample. 3.5.5. Biofilms in the 2759 mg/L NaCl (1674.7 mg/L Chloride) Condition after 7 Days The greatest difference was observed between the biofilms in reference condition and the biofilms in the 2759 mg/L NaCl (i.e., 1674.7 mg/L Chloride) condition. A noticeable reduction in abundance, with far fewer cells, was recognized at the highest concentration of salt, as shown in Figure 55. Again, salt is known to reduce biofilm growth which was consistent with high NaCl concentrations (Mahfoud et al., 2009; Cochero et al., 2017). Of the cells that were present, they had formed biofilms that were clustered tightly as aggregates, which was also expected at high concentrations (Mahfoud et al., 2008; pers. comm. M. Kroukamp, 2018). The extracellular polymeric substance and close aggregations of cells may have slowed the NaCl from penetrating and generally remained in the tight aggregations following vigorous shaking (Artiga et al., 2003). There was also a lowered diversity, with 134

Chlorella sp. as the dominant species at this concentration of NaCl, which is consistent with other studies (Cochero et al. 2017; Venancio et al., 2017). As mentioned previously, this may have been attributed to the ability for Chlorella sp. to withstand stressful environmental conditions due to its thick cell wall and activity by several enzymes (Venancio et al., 2017). As well, it may have been possible for Chlorella sp. to be alive until over 6,000 mg/L as suggested by CCME (2011). Diatoms were also present at the 2759 mg/L NaCl concentration, which was expected since some species are known to be impacted at very high concentrations (i.e. 40,000 mg/L for Nitzschia laevis) (Chen et al., 2008). It was also recognized that there was cell death as indicated by the brownish-colour of the algae as well as empty cells surrounded by EPS.

3.6. Overall Thesis Conclusions 3.6.1 Overall Conclusions from Benthic Macroinvertebrate Results There were some overall trends in benthic macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity. The upstream sites were generally high in abundance and diversity, with both pollution -tolerant and sensitive benthic macroinvertebrates present and hence, may be indicative of healthy aquatic ecosystems. The concentrations of chloride were generally low, often within ranges that were far below the CCME guidelines. However, there was one upstream site that was not consistent with the expected results for an upstream site, which was the Matheson Creek Upstream (UP_MAT) site. This site showed a high proportion of pollution-tolerant and low proportion of pollution-sensitive organisms. The concentration of chloride was among the lowest range of all sites, however, this site appeared to be impacted in some way. This may have been attributed to the sandy substrates that were present at this site, which is unfavourable for benthic macroinvertebrates (Merritt & Cummings, 1996). One of the main determining factors of benthic macroinvertebrate distribution is substrate type, with benthic macroinvertebrates being high in abundance in areas that provided rock or gravel substrates while they were found to be low in abundance in locations with sandy substrates (Merritt & Cummings, 1996; Chris Jones, pers. comm., 2016). Some seasonal variations may have influenced the abundance of certain insect groups such as the low proportions of Ephemeroptera in the spring in Willow Creek Upstream (UP_WIL) and low proportion of Chironomidae in the fall, which is consistent with the expected emergence period of these insect groups (Merritt & Cummings, 1996; Jones et al., 2007), while other sites did not show this variation. Another factor that could have affected the distribution of benthic macroinvertebrates was the presence of plants, leaf litter, and woody debris, which provided resources (i.e., food and places of refuge) (De Lange, 1994; Merritt & Cummings, 1996; Jones et al., 136

2007). In this study, benthic macroinvertebrates were found to be abundant in areas that provided these resources, which was consistent with the expected results. The downstream sites were often shown to have good abundance and diversity, and those that showed potential impact also provided sandy substrates (Merritt & Cummings, 1996; Jones et al., 2007). Most of the downstream sites had concentrations of chloride that were below the CCME guidelines. However, the most downstream site, East Holland River Downstream (MID_EH), was shown to have a chloride concentration that far exceeded the CCME guidelines and it showed the highest proportion of pollution-tolerant organisms and lowest proportion of pollution-sensitive organisms, which may be indicative of reduced water quality and aquatic ecosystem health. This is consistent with the expected results since this site is the most downstream and is located the most highly urbanized area. Hence, chloride may have had an impact on the abundance and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates at the extreme concentration. 3.6.2. Overall Conclusions from Aquatic Biofilms Results The aquatic biofilms at the low concentration of NaCl were shown to have the least degree of aggregation and highest cell growth and diversity, while the biofilms at the high concentrations of NaCl showed the highest degree of aggregation and the lowest degree of cell growth and diversity. Hence, the biofilms at the low and high concentrations of NaCl were consistent with the expected results (Artiga et al., 2003; Mahfoud et al., 2009; Cochero et al., 2017). Additionally, biofilms at the high concentrations of NaCl seemed to be dominated by Chlorella sp. and diatoms and were even shown to have some cell death. 3.7. Limitations of this Study Since there were so many interacting and contributing factors (i.e. seasonal variations, feeding groups and the river continuum concept, availability of resources, substrate type, and water quality, 137

etc.) that may have affected the distribution of benthic macroinvertebrates, it was difficult to determine the source of impact. While chloride from road salt is the contaminant of interest in this study, it was impossible to infer a direct causal relationship between stream chloride concentrations and benthic macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity. However, in some cases, relationships between benthic macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity indices and drainable area land cover between referencetest site pairs and across all sites do suggest that upstream urban land cover negatively impacts benthic macroinvertebrate communities. As well, the inability to conduct benthic macroinvertebrate assessments in the winter was also a limitation in this study. Additionally, there is currently an absence of standardized protocols on the culturing and toxicity testing of aquatic biofilms, which was a major limitation in this study. 3.8. Future Research This study can be compared with past and future benthic macroinvertebrate data by local conservation authorities to determine the trends in both abundance and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates as well as chloride concentrations over time. This may be increasingly important as weather and climate patterns change over time. With the increase in precipitation that is expected with climate change, as well as the increase in urbanization and concomitant road salt applications, there may be an increased need for monitoring in these areas. As well, conservation authorities can use this data to determine if any changes in benthic macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity have occurred with long-term reductions in road salt applications and other mitigation techniques. Additionally, an indepth chemical analysis could be conducted to identify other contaminants and stressors present in the watersheds to determine other sources of impact. This project can also be used as a platform for other laboratory experiments using freshwater 138

biofilm to determine NaCl toxicity to be built upon. For instance, DNA analysis could be conducted to determine the precise species that are present within the biofilms sample. Perhaps growing specific species and adding them in precise equivalent ratios to the flasks could eliminate some of the confounding variables such as the non-uniform distribution of biofilm species in the inoculum. As well, advanced technological solutions could be used to determine the viability of diatoms in salt since it was unclear if the diatoms were alive at the high chloride concentrations. The use of a spectrophotometer could also be implemented as a more effective method to determine cell growth since it was difficult to discern individual cells in the aggregated samples that could not be separated by vigorous shaking.
