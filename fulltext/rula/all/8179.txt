Abstract

Title: Integration of Underground Pumped Hydro Storage Membrane with Hybrid of Renewables and Diesel Generator in Off-grid Remote Area Communities of Ontario Degree: Master of Engineering Year: 2018 Student Name: Dildar Ali Jafri Program: Civil Engineering University: Ryerson University

Worldwide, off-grid remote areas are facing energy issues. The Canadian remote communities depend on diesel generation posing many issues including high fuel cost and greenhouse gas emissions. The government policy is to connect such communities to electricity grid that requires high cost and long time. In this situation renewable generators, including wind and solar, may be an appropriate solution. However, their intermittent nature is problematic that needs to be addressed. Therefore, this project investigated the integration of underground pumped hydro storage membrane system (UPHSM) to address the intermittency to provide steady and reliable power supply. A four step systematic methodology is proposed to examine the feasibility of UPHSM in a remote community. The case study results show an overall 64 percent reduction in diesel consumption and 295696 t in CO2 emission. The study results also confirmed that the proposed system is a viable solution for off-grid remote areas.

1 Introduction
1.1 Background
The global technological advancements along with continuous increase in population and industrialization have resulted in increasing the energy demand (Sadorsky 2013) that has lead the power industry towards higher energy production to meet the long term energy requirements. The non-renewable energy resources resulted in many issues such as the adverse effect on climate change, depletion of fossil fuel resources with increased prices and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The global attention has therefore diverted towards the renewable energy resources, especially wind and solar. However, these resources possess certain stochastic issues that need to be addressed for producing reliable and sustainable energy supplies. The wind and solar may fit into a specific application due to their specific properties as an additional advantage (Wadud et al. 2013). The integration of renewable energy, particularly wind and solar, with fuelbased energy power generation besides the energy storages, creates hybrid renewable energy systems (Bahramara et al. 2016) which may be attractive for remote communities. The

placement of energy storage with this system can further enhance the utilization of renewable energy resources. Many remote populated areas of world rely entirely on off-grid electricity supply. Efforts to connect such remote areas with reliable power grids can potentially improve the situation but it involves a high cost. Presently, most of these off-grid population is using diesel generators (DGs) involving a high fuel cost and excessive GHG emissions (Wilke et al. 2012). In Canada, there exist about 175 off-grid communities with population in excess of 100,000 people, out of which only 35 communities are using supply-mix electricity. The remaining 140 communities are entirely dependent on diesel generation (Arriaga et al. 2013). Further, Arriaga et al (Arriaga et al. 2013) stated that about 31 scattered remote settlements in Ontario with a total population of 15,000 have a high electricity cost that ranges from $0.4 to $1.2 per kWh (Arriaga et al. 2013). Moreover, the situation is worst in some community areas which are not well connected with the cities by road and hence, the fuel is transported by air to these areas, which is an additional burden of the fuel costs (Karanasios and Parker 2016). The above situation needs to be addressed by exploring alternative arrangements for providing clean, reliable, inexpensive and sustainable energy production in off-grid remote community
1

areas. Considering these important energy characteristics, the renewable energy resources have become the point of concentration, particularly for clean and inexpensive energy quality (Weis and Ilinca 2010) that can provide economical and sustainable energy in remote areas (National Renewable Energy Laboratory 2004). A literature review presented later in this report shows that this arrangement is still not applied to meet the instant power demand of the communities, and also reveals that the integration of energy storage is an appropriate solution to the problem. Discussing the case of wind and solar, the distributed integration of these renewables overcomes the losses of long distance transmission which is a prominent benefit of utilizing the renewable energy resources (RER). However, the intermittent nature of the wind and solar considerably affects the power production reliability (Weis and Ilinca 2010). Also, the imbalance between power production and energy demand may lead the setup towards system failure or instability (National Renewable Energy Laboratory 2001). Therefore the intermittent nature of the RER needs to be properly addressed to avoid any sort of probable imbalance between power production and energy demand that can be swiftly handled by integration of adequate storage unit to the established RER power unit. The integration of energy storage system for managing a greater penetration of wind and solar is still needed to address the power quality and to cover maximum electricity load of the system. Therefore the integration of energy storage system with wind, solar and diesel power generators has been focused on providing large energy storage potential to generate a steady and reliable power supply in off-grid remote areas. Among various available energy storage options, a newly introduced underground pumped hydro storage membrane (UPHSM) system has been considered in this study being a simple, easily deployable and cost-effective system for remote areas. Most of the off-grid remote communities in Ontario are settled in the vicinity of the natural water bodies that is an additional benefit to develop the UPHSM system. The above situation suggests evaluating the integration of UPHSM system with a hybrid of wind, solar and diesel generator in the off-grid remote area communities. Additionally the optimization of UPHSM scheduling followed by an economic analysis would be helpful to test the viability of the UPHSM system.

1.2 Project Problem and Objectives
1.2.1 Problem Statement In order to provide the clean energy to remote areas the renewables such as wind and solar are needed to associate with diesel generators. However the wind and solar are neither available at the right time of energy demand nor constantly providing the energy generation for a particular time period of electricity demand. In order to address the above issues, this study proposed the integration of UPHSM system with existing wind, solar and diesel generators and focused on the exploration of optimal solution to mitigate the uncertainty and intermittency of wind and solar power for providing a steady, reliable, demand oriented, and sustainable power supply to the off-grid remote settlements. Amongst the developed countries, Canada has the same situation with its remote communities particularly in northern areas, from Yukon to Newfoundland. There are various problems which have been faced by remote area communities due to diesel power generation as identified by AANDC in 2010 under their study of ecoENERGY for Aboriginal and Northern Communities Program Overview (Indigenous Affairs and Northern Development Canada 2010). The main concerns are highlighted below:          Considerable GHG emissions as a result of diesel fuel combustion; Long distances for fuel transportation by vehicles are also responsible and adding GHG emissions; Fuel becomes expensive due to additional transportation costs by road and air; Fuel spills during transportation is wastage ; Fuel spills at storage place create environmental issues; Generator noise cause disruption, especially in calm and quite remote vicinities; The breakdown of DG generally results in black-outs which are highly dangerous in extreme cold weathers; High diesel and heating fuel demand, especially in cold weather, adds to high energy expenditure; and High power price in off-grid remotes generally discourages the establishment of new businesses, ultimately limiting the future growth opportunities of the communities.

3

The above issues have invited the attention of this study to provide a feasible solution. In LTEP 2013, the Ontarios Ministry of Energy is intended to connect the remote communities with the grid power on priority basis (Ministry of Energy of Ontario 2013). It was further stated that all possible efforts would be worked out with the Federal Government to connect the remote Frist Nation communities to electricity grid or to find the alternatives where it is not economically feasible. This study has therefore selected Fort Severn community which is situated in far north of Ontario as a case study. The possibility of reaching the electricity grid to this area is highly difficult and uneconomical. Therefore, the proposed solution is to establish an energy storage system like UPHSM system which is simple, easily adoptable within a relatively short time period. Keeping in view the proposed system, this study has set the objectives as given in the following section. 1.2.2 Project Objectives In order to address the above issues, the specific objectives of this project are as follows:  To develop a mathematical model for scheduling of underground pumped hydro storage membrane (UPHSM) system for utilizing the available renewable energy resources in combination with existing diesel power generator in off-grid remote areas;  To establish a UPHSM system based on available renewable energy resources to integrate with wind and solar power generation to become a part of power-mix system with existing diesel generation in off-grid remote areas;   To apply optimization model and established UPHSM system on a case study in a remote area community; and To perform a financial analysis for life-period of UPSHM system.

2 Literature Review
2.1 Energy Storage Technologies
The energy storage plays an important role with renewable energies like wind and solar to control plant output and provide ancillary services to the utility operators. There are numerous energy storage technologies and new concepts are continually being developed. DÃ­az-GonzÃ¡lez et al. (DÃ­az-GonzÃ¡lez et al. 2012) provided an overview of different types of energy storages being utilized throughout the world along with their respective technologies.as listed below:    Gravitational Potential Energy with Water Reservoirs o Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) Compressed Air Energy o Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) Electrochemical Energy in Batteries and Flow Batteries o Lead-Acid Battery o Nickel-Cadmium Battery o Sodium-Sulfur Battery o Lithium-Ion Battery o Vanadium Redox Flow Battery o Zinc-Bromine Battery o Polysulfide-Bromide Flow Battery     Chemical Energy in Fuel Cells o Hydrogen Based Energy Storage System Kinetic Energy in Flywheels o Flywheel Energy Storage System Magnetic Field in Inductors o Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage Electric Field in Capacitors o Super-capacitor Energy Storage System The details of the above technologies can be viewed in various studies including Agrawal et al. (Agrawal et al. 2011), Beaudin et al. (2010), and Pickard et al (Pickard et al. 2009) . This study

5

has focused on pumped hydro storage technology which is widely used for integration with wind and solar energy generation. There are three main types of pumped hydro storage technologies:    On-Ground Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES)Technology o Conventional Pumped Hydro Storage System In-Ground Pumped Hydro storage Technology o Gravity Power Module (GPM) System Underground Pumped Hydro Storage (UPHS) Technology o Underground Pumped Hydro Storage Membrane (UPHSM) System This study focused on "Underground Pumped Hydro Storage Membrane (UPHSM) System

2.2 Rationales of Selecting UPHSM System
The rationales of selecting UPHSM system are as follows: Conventional PHES technology requires two reservoirs with a high elevation difference. For this purpose the favorable topologies rarely exist that makes difficult to identify the feasible sites. Additionally, this technology involves very high cost and lengthy construction time. With regard to GPM technology, deep excavation is required which is also very expensive. This technology has high operation and maintenance cost after commissioning of the project. The UPHSM facility does not require any complex topology to find a feasible site and it does not need deep excavations as well. It is less costly as compared to both conventional and GPM technologies. The construction of UPHSM facility is also simple since it involves shallow excavations just below the ground. The operation and maintenance of this system is relatively easy and inexpensive. The energy storage capacity under this technology can easily be adjusted according to the requirement of the power demand of the remote areas. The construction components of UPHSM technology like soil transportation, providing penstock, pump turbine unit, and storage membrane are easy to manage in the remote area conditions. Additionally, the cost of this technology is comparatively less than the other technologies and the construction labor is relatively basic.

2.3 Review of UPHSM Technology
The underground pumped hydro storage (UPHS) technology is a well-established energy storage system. Following the principle of UPHS, Olsen et al. (2015) introduced a novel concept of using a membrane to store the water which is named as Underground Pumped Hydro Storage Membrane (UPHSM). The energy is stored by elevating a mass of dart or soil through water being pumped into a below-ground readily constructed cavity. The cavity is composed of two impervious water-proof flexible membranes properly sealed along the edges. The schematic diagram of the UPHSM system is presented in Figure 2-1

Figure 2-1 Schematic diagram of PHSM system

One of the basic requirements for pumped hydro storage (PHS) is that there should be an elevation difference to create a head difference between the two water reservoirs. The force conveyed for power generation is provided from the hydrostatic pressure obtained from the head level difference of the two reservoirs. The new concept of UPHSM suggested a solution for the circumstances where this kind of elevation difference is not possible due to unfavorable topographic conditions. The conventional concept here is to facilitate the elevation difference by employing the upper reservoir in a below-ground cavity. The important feature of this concept is the fairly price efficient design where the main cost component is required for movement of the soil. The cost analysis indicated that a full-scale
7

system will be economically viable when associated to the remote area power grid where the income can be generated by providing the daily power demand as well as marketing ancillary services, (Olsen et al. 2015). Figure 2-2 shows the schematic diagram of Longitudinal and Cross Sectional views of UPHSM system. The different parts of this system have been indicated using alphabetical letters as given below: A: Inflatable Cavity B: Connecting Pipe C: Pump System D: Water Reservoir E: Strainer F: Lower Membrane G: Top Soil H: Level Metre I: Pressure Gauge J: Flow Metre

It is assumed that the hydrostatic pressure in the membrane cavity, hydrodynamic losses, and the possible effects of energy stored in the soil edge zone are negligible. Therefore, the total stored energy (E) assuming the square dimensions of a square membrane cavity (length = width = L) can be calculated by the formula given in Equation 2.1. E= where, If, L Hs Hl g E = Energy (kWh) = Edge length of the membrane (m) = Soil layer thickness (m) = Maximum lift height (m) = Gravitational acceleration (m/ ) = Efficiency of pump-turbine unit = Soil density (kg/ ) ................................................

In addition to the above technological details, Olsen et al. (2015) provided the values of design parameters at three experiment levels including lab test, field test, and full scale plant as given in Table 2-1. Table 2-1 Values of design parameters based on different experiments

2.4 Review of Electricity System in Off-Grid Remote Areas
The study of Kartsounesl and Ahrens (1979) discussed two types of storages including compressed air energy storage (CAES) and underground pumped hydro energy storage (UPHES). This study compared the characteristics of both storages and evaluated their potential impacts. Accordingly, it was concluded that although UPHES system needs a large underground reservoir and longer construction period, it is technically simple and its overall efficiency is high. The study of Martin (2007) discussed a new concept for underground pumped hydroelectric energy storage system. This study recommended that this system may prove to be a suitable and promising system for pumped hydro energy storage in agriculture environment. The study also recommended the future work to improve the technology for obtaining better socioeconomic and environmental benefits. The study by Maine (2009) presented the riverbank power generation technology and described its working principle to store energy from excess or surplus energy at grid level during off-peak hours and emission-free generation during peak periods of about six hours. In this study, the basic technology concept was provided and the details of Diversion River Bank Wiscasset Energy Centre and closed loop riverbank Sparta Energy Centre were briefly discussed. The study by Al-Awami et al. (2009) discussed the stochastic nature of wind power and debated on the predictions of wind. The study discussed various aspects of wind power installation. This study has not discussed the solutions for intermittencies and uncertainties of wind. The study by Weis (Weis and Ilinca 2010) discussed and validated the potential for a windÂ­ diesel production incentive intended for remote communities of Canada. This study stated that about 300 remote communities are suffering with high energy costs, yet Canada has attained partial success in mounting remote wind energy projects. Most of Canadas large-scale wind power generation is a direct result of a Federal Government incentive introduced in 2002. This study determined how the deployment of an incentive can be customized for remote wind power to potentially improve the situation in remote areas. This study also emphasized on the

implementation of customized energy solutions for Canadian remotes. Pejovic (Pejovic 2011) studied the energy resources which are environment friendly including the hydro storages as prospective means to store the excess energy produced by wind, solar,
10

nuclear and run-of-river using pumped hydro energy storage system. This study explained that although the nuclear and gas power plants possess the potential of higher energy production to meet power demand, but with high maintenance costs associated with the environmental concerns. This study proposed that the cost of a high head pumped storage plant can be recovered within 5 to 10 years using moderate or average revenue and the surface plants cost can be recovered even in 4 to 6 years. The study by PIER (2011) presented energy storage strategies that can be implemented in California by 2020. The report discussed and analyzed various available energy storage technologies and policies affecting their implementation in California. The report also discussed critical gaps in technology and proposed policy reform and future research requirements. Various energy storage technologies were studied by Agrawal et al. (Agrawal et al. 2011) and an assessment of technological readiness and economic feasibilities were conducted to facilitate their implementation. Though the study work has not mentioned the off-grid remote areas, it offers various energy storage options which can be deployed in off-grid remote environment and opens a vast door for future studies. addressed the prevailing power situation in Bangladesh and discussed the power supply demand ratio. This study addressed the potential of various renewable resources to utilize as an alternate power resource in the country scenario and analyzed how far the renewable energy can be treated as an ideal solution in the economic development of the country. This research did not address the wind and solar intermittency solutions. Arriaga et al. (Arriaga et al. 2013) studied the renewable energy option to reduce the diesel fuel dependency for remote communities in northern Ontario and conducted the detailed analysis of various scenarios with low renewable energy penetration (7%) and high renewable energy penetration (18%). The proposed system proved the positive impact in reducing the fuel consumption, operating cost and GHG emissions. However, this study did not propose the solution to address the intermittency of renewable energies. The study of Martin (2015) discussed the long-term renewable energy generation planning for off-grid remote communities. This study has not addressed energy storage options so as to store the redundant energy of renewable units to utilize their full potential.
11

The study of Cordero (2015) developed systematic approach for optimal design of hybrid renewable energy systems at micro-grids for remote communities to overcome the use of diesel generator which is uneconomical and environmentally untenable for the remote communities. The study also addressed the environmental and economic issues to diesel power generation and proposed a hybrid renewable energy system. However, the integration of energy storage was not discussed which is needed to enhance of sustainability of hybrid system and utilize the full potential of renewable energy. The study by Alharbi (2015) established a multi-year operational planning model to define battery energy storage system (BESS) for optimal power rating and energy capacity in coordination with year of installation. Several scenarios of ownership were studied for different BESS technologies to estimate the optimal planning decisions. This study potentially addressed the uncertainty of solar and wind. Several micro-grid operational situations were created and studied. To decide the optimal BSS size, a stochastic optimization model was created including different year state of uncertain micro-grid variables. The study by Wang et al. (2016) focused on the battery energy storage system for wind-diesel off-grid power system located in a Quebec community in Canada. The study proposed an optimal planning model to optimize the economic environmental gains and system dependability. The battery energy capacity and rated converter capacity were synchronized to optimal variables. Several possible scenarios were studied and analyzed in this study. The study resulted in the optimal design of a BE storage unit enhanced the dependability of the wind-diesel system and improved the environmental and economic benefits. It is important to note that the study by Alharbi (Alharbi 2015) and Wang et al. (Wang et al. 2016) have utilized the battery storage to address the uncertainty of renewables and enhance the dependability of the system. However, the battery storage duration limitation was an issue. It was recommended that a smaller-scale unit may give better results. However, the large-scale energy storage system still needs to be tested at the community area power demand. The study by Liu et al. (2016) focused on optimization of energy capacity at micro-grid level and proposed a planning strategy of integrating the battery energy storage with wind and solar energy. He has classified micro grid loads in to three categories. Level 1 load is the load that must be supplied without interruption, level 2 load is the load that should be supplied with
12

minimal interruption and level 3 load can be interrupted if necessary. The superconductor was used only for the fast response at level 1 load. Li-ion & Lead Acid batteries were used mainly for the medium response at level 2 load but it can be used for level 1 load if required. Similarly diesel generator (DG) was mainly considered for level 3 load and it can also be used as a back-up source for level 1 and level 2 loads. These storage devices possess the storage capacity and time limit issues. It is important to note that the study result shows that three storages used are still insufficient to meet the power demand and backup of diesel generation was required. This situation confirmed that this study did not employ the high capacity energy storage to utilize the maximum potential of wind and solar. The study by Boute (2016) revealed that electricity supply in Russian remotes was heavily dependent on diesel generators that imposed critical socio-economic burden on the residents, besides the adverse environmental impact due to greenhouse gas emissions and oil spills. The substitution of renewable energy minimized the prevailing costs of electricity supply of Russian remote areas. This study also reviewed Russias off-grid renewable energy policy concentrating on the up gradation of wind- and solar-diesel hybrid energy modules in the Russian Arctic. This study also discussed the possibility to adopt the FIT program of Canada, the options of avoided cost energy tariff, and transfer of subsidies from diesel generation to RES for establishing the renewable energy production in remote areas. However, this study has not addressed the integration of energy storage to mitigate the intermittency of renewable energy. The study by Arriaga et al. (2016) worked on long-term planning model of renewable energies to present the capital costs per unit of installed capacity of renewable energy. It was claimed that the presented model was capable of evaluating various renewable energy projects through years for long-term renewable energy development programs. The results have shown that the proposed model was suitable to get feasible renewable energy plans. As discussed above, various studies have worked on renewable energy and diesel power generation and addressed multi-significant off-grid remote issues including economic, environmental and social aspects. However, the suitable option of energy storage in remote areas was rarely discussed. This study has therefore focused on the option of energy storage that can have a greater storage capacity to address the intermittent nature of wind and solar power generation. In this regard, the UPHSM system as a novel energy storage technology is
13

considered to integrate with wind, solar and diesel power generators and to find the optimal solution of utilizing the system for producing reliable power supply to off-grid remote settlements. Additionally, most of the off-grid Canadian remotes communities are located near water bodies which provide an advantage of utilizing the nearby water to establish a UPHSM system. This study has therefore selected the case study of Fort Severn community located near Severn River. A report by Karanasios and Parker (2016) discussd the recent developments of renewable energy in remote aboriginal communities of Ontario and reported that only 20 kW solar power potential is existed whereas 300 kW solar potential is expected to be available by 2016 at Fort Severn community area. This report has not provided any detail of existing wind potential in this community. Therefore, keeping in view the future electricity requirement of Fort Severn

community, this project study assumed 4000 kW wind power potential for this area to provide wind power to the proposed UPHSM system.

3 Methodology
3.1 General Approach
The overall approach is to develop a methodology for integration of UPHSM system with diesel generator using wind and solar for their maximum utilization to meet the power demand of offgrid remote area communities. The wind and solar generation cannot be instantly utilized at all the times due to their uncertain nature. There are possibilities that renewable power generation is available when the electricity is not required and similarly, the renewable power is not available when the electricity is needed. Additionally, the fluctuating power is not reliable in the electricity market and, hence, the full electricity generation of wind and solar cannot be utilized. The solution of all these situations is the energy storage with compatible energy capacity so that the maximum generation can be stored for use when it is needed. Therefore, the capacity of energy storage is dependent on the available power potential of renewables which include the existing and proposed wind and solar potential to supply the electricity for the concerned community area. This study has therefore selected the UPHSM system for integrating with wind and solar in combination with diesel generator which is the basic power producing source in remote area. The systematic approach of this methodology includes the following steps:     Developing optimization model for scheduling of UPHSM in combination with diesel generation by utilizing renewable energy potential; Establishing UPHSM unit based on available renewable energy potential; Applying optimization model on a case study; and Performing financial analysis of UPHSM system.

The methodological process for the above steps is explained in the following sections. 3.2 Developing Optimization Model for Scheduling of UPHSM System

In order to utilize the optimal power discharged by UPHSM unit at different demand hours (off, mid and peak) in combination with exiting DG, an optimization model is developed. The steps to developing the optimization model have been described in the following sub-sections.

3.2.2 Model Operating Principles The stakeholders of the electricity generation and supply to the remote area community include the government, the utility operator, renewable energy providers and the community as electricity consumers. This study assumes that the cooperation and inter-relationship among the stakeholders is a main driving force to establish the UPHSM system. Therefore, this study proposed a cooperative association to represent the stakeholders which is named as UPHSM cooperative association (UCA). This association is responsible to run the whole UPHSM system. The basic principle of the system is that UCA purchases power from renewable generators during off-peak period to store water in the storage to discharge it to the consumer during midpeak and on-peak periods. The balance demand of the consumers is met by the Diesel Generator being operated by the existing utility operator. 3.2.3 Problem Formulation It is assumed that the optimization period is the life period of UPHSM unit and each year having nS seasons in nD days in one season. The operating cycle of UPHSM system is assumed as one day of nT hours. The model optimizes total power produced by diesel generator and UPHSM system in one cycle period that is divided in three components including off-peak, mid-peak and on-peak hours. The model variables are the energy supplied by UPHSM and diesel generator in the off-peak, mid-peak and on-peak hours in a day. Objective Function The model maximizes the revenue generated by sales and purchases of energy by UPHSM and diesel generator in a year minus yearly O&M cost of UPHSM system. For simplification of this problem, the yearly expense OMCy of UCA includes the yearly O&M cost and admin fee of UCA. Let the energy sales by UPHSM are , and in off-peak, mid-peak and on-

peak hours respectively. Similarly, the components of energy sales by diesel generator are , and in off, mid and on-peak hours respectively.

Let the components of energy purchase by UPHSM are

,

and

in off, mid

and on-peak hours respectively. Similarly, the components of energy purchase by diesel generator are , and in off, mid and on-peak hours respectively.

Let the rate for sale of energy is BA which is same for both UPHSM and diesel generator in all energy sale periods. The rate for purchase of energy by diesel generator is same as the rate for sale of power while the rate for purchase of energy by UPHSM is assumed as CA. Therefore, objective function can be written as follows: Maximize the net profit of UCA = Yearly revenue generated by UPHSM and diesel generator Â­ yearly expense of UCA.   ( ) ( )

Total energy supply from UPHSM and diesel generator should be equal to the total system demand ..............................................................................................

UPHSM system can supply maximum power up to 90% of the system demand because (i) it purchases power in off-peak period and (ii) to utilize the diesel generator in the system ......................................................................................................... (2) 3. Power sale by diesel generator is same as the power purchase by diesel generator ............................................................................................................ (3) 4. Power sale by UPHSM is less than power purchase by UPHSM because the UPHSM system is not fully efficient, and therefore the power sale is equal to the power purchase times the efficiency.

3.3 Establishing UPHSM System
3.3.1 Estimating Component Sizes of UPHSM Unit The power to be stored by UPHSM unit is entirely dependent on available renewable potential of the community. Therefore storage capacity of UPHSM unit can be estimated from available renewable potential. After estimating the UPHSM storage capacity, the component sizes of UPHSM plant are determine appropriately considering the optimal capacity. The necessary components of UPHSM system are given in Table 3-2. Table 3-2 Component sizes of UPHSM plant
No. 1 2 3 4 5 Component UPHSM membrane for underground storage Lift height of soil layer Soil layer placed over membrane Pump-turbine power potential Efficiency of pump-turbine Size Area Height Thickness Power Unit Meter Meter Watt percentage

The size of UPHSM membrane, lifting height and thickness of soil layer need to suitably selected using the energy formula to satisfy the optimal storage capacity of the UPHSM system given in Equation 2-1 The life period of UPHSM system and efficiency of pump-turbine are selected using the data available in past studies. 3.3.2 Identifying Suitable UPHSM Site
20

The suitable sites should qualify the minimum area of the designed storage capacity of the UPHSM system which is based on the optimization results. Additionally, the selected site should be free from environmental constraints and it should be located near the existing wind farm and solar installations and in the proximity of existing DG. 3.3.3 Locating Waterbody In order to develop the UPHSM system, a water body satisfying the minimum required volume of water is needed. The water bodies commonly include lakes, rivers and reservoirs. In addition to these water bodies sea water may also be used for this energy storage (Olsen et al. 2015).

3.4 Performing Financial Analysis of UPHSM System
The financial analysis of UPHSM system involves the following financial indicators:     Minimum acceptable rate of return (MARR) Net present value (NPV) Internal rate of return (IRR) Payback period

The above indicators are to be computed using their respective formulae available in the literature.

4 Case Study
4.1 Description of Case Study

This case study is concerned with Fort Severn a remote Aboriginal First Nations community in the province of Ontario (Figure 4-1). According to Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (2013) there is no road access to this community that imposes higher transportation costs of goods in this community. The total registered population for Fort Severn community is around 635 people (Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada 2013). Figure 4-1 Location map of Forte Severn community, Ontario

Population Growth of Fort Severn Community Area Statics Canada (2015) reported that the total aboriginal population growth rate for ten years period from 1996 to 2006 is 45% as given in Figure 4-3. This data estimates annual growth rate as 4% for combined population growth of total aboriginal and non-aboriginal population.

Figure 4-2 Population growth of different communities settled in Fort Severn area Source: Statics Canada (2015) Existing Electricity System Karanasios and Paul (2016) stated that present power demand of the Fort Severn community is managed by diesel power generation. A diesel generated power plant of 550 kW capacity is supplying power to meet the community demand. Issues of Existing System Indigenous Affairs and Northern Development Canada (2010) discussed the issues of all the relevant community including Fort Severn community. The issues include GHG emissions from power generation and vehicles. Additionally, the transportation costs by road and air results in increase of fuel costs. The fuel spills during its transportation and at the storage areas are causing environmental issues. Generator noise is a big disruption in quite remote conditions. The breakdown in diesel power generating unit also results in black-outs. High electricity rates in off-

23

grid remote areas generally discourage the establishment of new businesses that ultimately limits the future development growth opportunities in the communities. Possible Solutions Fort Severn off-grid community is situated in far north of Ontario and connectivity to Ontario power grid is not only expensive, it is also not feasible (Ontario Ministry of Energy, 2013). This situation suggests the establishment of renewable power generation like wind and solar generation. However, wind and solar energy are uncertain and intermittent in nature. This problem can be mitigated by integrating the energy storage with renewables. It is important to note that for meeting emergencies and supply option in case of unavailability of wind and solar at night, the DG cannot be fully eliminated. Therefore supply mix is the possible options in this area. However, the use of DG can be minimized by utilizing the renewable energy supply. Therefore, this project proposed a hybrid system model of supply-mix power using the wind, solar and available DG resources. Energy storage of UPHSM system has been integrated with wind and solar to overcome their intermittencies and uncertainties as well as to provide reliable supply. The proposed hybrid system minimizes the diesel energy generation, resulting in reduced GHG emissions. It is expected that the proposed UPHSM system would also result in providing indirect benefits to the community and the Government such as reliable and sustainable power production to meet the present and future electricity demands of the community. As a result, there will be improvement in existing business, encouragement for new businesses and development of welfare facilities such as schools, hospital, shopping malls, gas stations, fire stations that may result to attract new settlers. Therefore, the proposed solution can contribute in long-term development of the community. 4.1.1 Stakeholders of Fort Severn Electricity System The stake holders for the electricity generation in remote community areas of Ontario are as follows:
    Provincial Government Â­ Ontario Government Utility Operator - Hydro One Remote Community Inc. (HORCI) Fuel Suppliers Â­local community members Consumers Â­ Fort Severn community 24

The government of Ontario through the Ontario Energy Board applies the regulations to provide funding for the electricity generation projects and to provide subsidy on electricity supply to the remote area communities. The government of Ontario also provides subsidy to the customers under the Remote or Rural Electricity Rate Protection (RRRP-Govt. of Ontario 1998). HORCI is a non-for-government entity that works province-wide for not to generate any profit. The HORCI is responsible to purchase the diesel from the local community sources. The community is responsible to secure the funding provided by the provincial government for the electricity generation projects. In planning and installation phase of the project, total funding is provided by provincial government. After commissioning of the project, two third cost is provided by the government in subsidy form and remaining one third part of O&M cost is covered from the consumers by sale of electricity. Figure 4-3 shows the stakeholders participation in electricity generation activities of remote area communities in Ontario.

4.1.2 Existing Electricity Rates and Subsidy Policies Arriaga et al (Arriaga et al. 2016) provided the electricity rates and subsidies in remote area communities. The applicable electricity rates in remote area communities of Canada are classified as follows: Unsubsidized Customers: These customers pay the actual electricity cost. These rates mainly applied to the federal government clients and some community owned buildings. These customers are, therefore, allowed to install their own RE equipment for self-consumption purpose. It is important to note that there is no subsidy for the government clients and the community owned buildings (Arriaga et al. 2013). Subsidized Customers: These customers pay electricity rates matching the electricity rates of southern locations of the provinces. In general these rates are applied to residential customers. These electricity rates are 10% to 20% of the actual electricity cost. The utility operator charges subsidized electricity rate of $0.13/kWh following the residential electricity customer rate effective from Jan 1, 2012 (Hydro One 2012). Avoided Fuel Cost (AFC) Customers: This is not an electricity rate. This is a fuel displacement cost resulting from renewable electricity generation and the diesel generation including administration and transportation costs. The AFC ultimately represent the energy cost to compete the RE project against DG. Under the AFC, a power purchase agreement can be established with the utility to export RE power to the micro-grid by fixing the rate to AFC. UPHSM System Impact on Subsidy It can be observed that the cost of DG power in off-grid communities is very high than grid power. Therefore, to match the power supply rate of off-grid communities with grid power, the Government of Canada has to bear a high financial cost in terms of subsidies and rebates as explained above. UPHSM can decrease the power production cost in off-grid location and the load of subsidy could also be reduced. Accordingly, the proposed UPHSM system could be a useful step if potential savings in diesel consumption are achieved.

Applying Optimization for Combined Scheduling of UPHSM and Diesel Generation

The optimization model used the proposed capacity of the storage which is based on available data of the case study. The methodological process provided in chapter 3 was applied for establishing the UPHSM system in the case study area with the following assumptions: 1. The "UPHSM system" is existed in the case study area. 2. The renewable generators including wind and solar are existed and provide supply for pumping operation of UPHSM system. 3. As such the hybrid system comprising UPHSM unit, DG, and renewable energy generators is fully operative and capable to meet the power demand of the case study area. 4.2.1 Data Sheet The model parameters used in optimization process and their values are provided in Table 4-1.

Establishing UPHSM System Using Optimal Storage Capacity

Considering the available renewable potential in the Fort Severn community area, storage capacity of the UPHSM system is 41,728 kWh. Accordingly, the component sizes have been appropriately adjusted to satisfy the available storage capacity using the UPHSM energy formula as given below. E = The following result satisfied the available energy capacity: E = (9.81m/sec2 x 2000 kg/m3 x 10m x 250m x 250m x 15.31m x 0.8) / 1000 x 3600 = 41,728 kWh Accordingly, Table 4-5 was prepared to provide the component sizes of the proposed UPHSM system. Table 4-5 Component sizes of UPHSM system
No. 1 2 3 4 Component sizes Size of UPHSM membrane for underground storage Lift height of soil layer Thickness of soil layer Efficiency of pump-turbine Unit m2 m m % Value 250 x 250 10 15.31 80%

Therefore, the above component sizes are the UPHSM system design parameters of this study project. Minimum Water Flow Rate to Fill the UPHSM Water Storage Chamber Volume of the chamber = 250m x 250m x 10m = 625000 m3 Proposed operational pumping hours in one cycle = 12hrs = 43200 sec. Flow = 625000 m3/43200 sec = 14.47 m3 /sec Assuming 100% allowance on the flow rate, the required minimum water flow rate in the river should be 28.9 m3 /sec

4.3.1 Identifying Suitable UPHSM Site In order to identify a suitable site for establishing UPHSM system in Forte Severn community, the shape file of Fort Severn area was downloaded from Ryerson Geospatial Map & Data Centre (https://library.ryerson.ca/gmdc/madar/geo-data/search). The Fort Severn polygon was extracted from ,,Census Subdivision Boundary File (Statistics Canada 2014) using Select tool in ArcGIS as shown in Figure 4-4.

Figure 4-4 Shape file of Fort Severn community area The possible areas were identified using GIS tools in ArcGIS software. The following layers were used for screening purpose to identify the feasible sites:       Built-up areas (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources 2006); Existing local infrastructure other than residential area (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources 2012); Provincial parks (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources 2008); National wild life area (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources 2005); NGO natural reserves (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources 2009); Wetland (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources 2011);

Each layer was erased from the Fort Severn shape one by one to get the area free from any constraint. Figure 4-4 shows the available constraints free areas.
33

Figure 4-5 Constraints free areas in Fort Severn Area In order to find the sites within 500 meter and at least 200 meter away from the roads, multiple ring buffer tool was used to generate an area with minimum 200 meter and maximum 500 meters distance from roads. The result of multiple ring buffers is shown in Figure 4-6. This area was clipped from ,,Constraints Free Area to generate another shape file free from constraints and within proposed road distance. This shape file was named as ,,Candidate Areas as shown in Figure 4-7

34

Figure 4-6 Buffer zones around roads

Figure 4-7 Candidate areas within buffer zone Using ArcGIS, the area was divided into multiple rectangles using ArcGIS shape Editor, where sites could be formed. After cutting these rectangles, Multipart to Single part tool was used to generated areas, named as ,,Candidate Sites as shown in Figure 4-8.

35

Figure 4-8 Candidate sites The waterbodies shape file (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources 2010) was downloaded to select best suitable waterbody for site. The waterbodies file was processed by Spatial Join tool to find waterbodies within 1 Km of Fort Severn. After processing, 181 waterbodies were found as shown in Figure 4-9. Out of these waterbodies, Fort Severn River was selected having largest flow. The shape file of Fort Severn River was extracted from waterbodies shape file using Select tool.

4.3.2 Locating Waterbody in Proximity to UPHSM Site In order to establish the UPHSM site, a map of Fort Severn area was downloaded from the website: https://library.ryerson.ca/gmdc/madar/geo-data/search of Ryerson University Library and Archives (RULA) to study the available water bodies in this area. The water bodies map prepared by Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (2010) was considered for this study. It was observed that Limestone Rapids station at Severn River is the nearest discharge recording station for Fort Severn community area. The location located map of Severn River is shown in Figure 4-14.

Figure 4-14 Location map of Severn River segment in vicinity of Fort Severn area Source: https://www.travelblog.org/Photos/5290962 (Cited on Nov 09, 2017) The average monthly discharge of Severn River at station Limestone Rapids (Station No. 04CC001) was taken from "National water data archive" database. The mean flow values as obtained from database are provided in Table 4-6.

The above flow data shows that the minimum available discharge of the Severn River is 181.45 m3/ sec in the month of March which is much higher than the minimum water flow requirement for the UPHSM system (28.9 m3 /sec as calculated in section 4.3). Therefore, it is confirmed that the Severn River is a suitable waterbody for the proposed UPHSM system in the Fort Severn community area. The schematic diagram of the Established UPHSM unit is shown in Figure 415.

Results and Discussions

The proposed UPHSM system is designed for a life period of 50 years. The system purchases energy from renewable generators and stores in the membrane chamber. The system works on mix power supply concept managed by UPHSM and DG. The proposed model is applied on a case study area of Fort Severn, Ontario. The optimization results provided the power supply to consumers in off, mid and peak hours by UPHSM and DG as shown in Table 4-7.

The overall savings in diesel energy and respective consumption of fuel during the life period of UPHSM is calculated as 64.2%. Accordinly the reduction in CO2 emmission has been calculated as given below: Total saving on DG = Total DG supply x saving factor kWh = (4,781,479 x 365) x 64.2/100 = 1,120,443,974 kWh Fuel Saving = 1,120,443,974 kWh/10 = 112,044,397L

(Assuming that 1L of diesel producs 10 kWh: https://deepresource.wordpress.com/2012/04/23/energy-related-conversion-factors/) Reduction in CO2 emission = (112,044,397 x 2.639)/1000 t = 296,696 t (Assuming that 1L of diesel produces 2.639 kgs of CO2 : https://carbonpositivelife.com/co2-perlitre-diesel/) The above calculation estimate the total reduction of 295,696t on CO2 emissions over the life period of UPHSM.

6 Conclusion
6.1 Chapter Wise Summary The chapter wise summary of this project is as follows: Chapter 1 of this project is composed of the issues associated with DG, need to establish renewable generators, background of the project, problem statement, and project objectives. Chapter 2 provides the literature review of energy storage technologies and particularly UPHSM technology with rationales for its selection. Chapter 3 is composed of a four step methodology which includes optimization to calculate amount of power supply by UPHSM unit and DG in off, mid and on peak time, establishing UPHSM model unit, application of this model on a case study and performing financial analysis of UPHSM. Chapter 4 provides the details of the selected case study area, establishing the prosed UPHSM system on case study area with results and discussions. Chapter 5 gives the financial analysis for life period of proposed UPHSM system, wind farm, and solar installations. Chapter 6 provides the overall conclusion of the project.

6.2 Project Conclusions
The conclusions of this project are summarized as follows:   The proposed UPHSM system fully satisfied the utility of available renewable generation and respective reduction in diesel generation. The developed UPHSM system also confirmed that energy supply was capable to meet the energy demands in different periods that proved the system performance was satisfactory in terms of providing steady and reliable power supply. The engineering financial analysis confirmed that the developed UPHSM model is beneficial to all concerned stake holders.  The engineering economic analysis of the proposed UPHSM system provided the total NPV as C$ 19,931,388 the payback period as 20.3 Years and IRR as 6.52%, which confirmed that the system is beneficial to all concerned stakeholders.  The proposed UPHSM system offered an overall fuel saving of 64.2 percent and a reduction of 295,696 tons in CO2 emission over the life period of the system.

The comparison of two systems, DG only and hybrid of UPHSM with RE and DG concluded that the hybrid system has multiple benefits over DG only and can successfully work as a viable long term cleans energy power solution for off-grid remotes.

6.3 Project Contribution
The possible contribution of this project for off-grid community areas are as follows:         Fuel cost reduction and less blackout risks; Greater penetration of renewable power in supply-mix; Direct benefit to Ontarios off-grid remote area communities; The developed model could be a sustainable and viable power supply solution to other similar remotes of Canada and the world; Creation of employment during construction and operational phases; Over indirect benefits it offers the improvement in quality of life of remote area communities and attract new settlers; Helpful in strengthening the existing businesses and establishing new businesses; and Helpful in promoting the overall growth of the off-grid remote area communities.

6.4 Future Work
  UPHSM is an emerging energy storage technology and therefore more studies are required to refine the system for economy, life and efficiency. Currently it is the policy of Canadian government to promote the renewable energy penetration in off-grid remotes. The energy storage associations can participate to strengthen the system sustainability. Further studies are therefore required to explore the best fit energy storage solutions to individual remote area conditions.  Most of the Ontario off-grid remote communities are in the vicinity of natural water bodies, which offer an ideal situation for establishing UPHSM system. Therefore, further research is required to refine the establishment the UPHSM at such coastal off-grid remotes.
