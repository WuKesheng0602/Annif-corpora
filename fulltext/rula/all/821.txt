Being And Technical Humans, Hybrids And The Ontology Of Machines.
By James Alexander Forbes, Master of Arts, Communications and Culture, Ryerson
University, Toronto, 2009.

Abstract:

This paper discusses the possibilities of mechanical life. A non-dual methodology borrowed
from Martin Heidegger combines the materialist media theory of Friedrich Kittler with Bernard Steigler's teleological philosophy of technics. This perspective is employed to analyze the literature and film of science fiction, and in particular, the recent television

series, Battlestar Galactica. This analysis permits the elaboration of a communicationsbased ontology that at once highlights the individual (human) and systemic (material)

aspects of the life world, and ultimately delivers an articulation of Being that is systemic and individual. It attempts to transcend traditional subject object distinctions and to
naturalize the theoretical progression from biological to technical life by suggesting that

human being is always already hybrid technical being, and that technological being is not only a logical, but also perhaps necessary product of Western cultural progression.

particular BSG will serve to illuminate and illustrate the central claim that human ontology is

always already bound up in technics. The three central theoretical sources for this study are
the non-dual philosophy of the later Martin Heidegger, the post-humanist and material media
studies of Friedrich Kittler, and the philosophical rehabilitation of the history of technics offered by Bernard Steigler. Heidegger's non-dual ontology provides the theoretical foundation out of which the basic problem of the subject-object schism may be mitigated. It

also potentially allows for a rapprochement between Kittler's decidedly anti-teleological
perspective and Steigler's inherently systemic articulation. This is significant, because it is
arguable that Steigler and Kittler offer to each other important perspectives that the other

lacks. Further, a situated and complete perspective on communication as a technical and

linguistic phenomenon requires us to consider both systemic and individual perspectives--
that is communications as made up of systems of ill-defined objects, and of discrete technical objects and discrete human subjects. It is therefore probable that both positions are necessary for a truly non-dual reading and the rehabilitation of the importance of technics to ontology.

Technics (and its role in human affairs) is frequently determined by and against its perceived

asymmetrical and inferior relationship with language. This obscures the essential unity of and balance between language and technics, which in turn produces a mis-apprehension of the role and place of each in ontological research. Between techno-determinism and intellectual ludditism, there exists a middle ground in which the place of technics in human affairs may
be viewed as integral and essential. This position is explored by focusing on the how technics

value of theoretical knowledge, and the notion that theory has a useful and practical role to

play in intellectual life. This work attempts to situate itself outside of the politics and rhetoric
of opposition and dualistic thought, and hopes to offer a methodological bridge between the

frequently distant poles of science and the humanities. It is intended to be introductory to an
inquiry into the nature of the relationship between human beings and technics as it relates to the larger philosophical question of Being, and it this sense it is preliminary and deeply
indebted to the work of Heidegger, Stiegler, and Kittler.lt situates itself generally both

within and against a tradition, although the situation of this work is by no means
comprehensively understood nor completely fleshed out at this point. Rather, the paper suggests potential avenues of further research and exploration that may prove fruitful.

Each of the four tropes discussed and explored in this paper relate to the larger ontological

inquiry, but they cannot hope to define it in its entirety1. Memory, Metaphor, Monster, and
Medium may be examined individually, systemically, or from both perspectives. The

relationship posited between the two perspectives, of individual beings and the larger movement of Being is such that, after Heidegger, the former have access to the latter, but the latter is not simply defined by the former. The significant difference between the argument advanced in this paper and Heidegger's elaboration of Being is that this formulation includes techne (technology/craft/art) in the movement of Being not as that against which human beings may discover the philosophical truth of Being or as a mode of revealing or aletheia (literally uncovered-ness, or more plainly, truth), but that which constitutes, along with

language, (as communication) human being itself. From this position, the greater arc of
Being may perhaps be y understood as progressing from the organic to the technical.

Heidegger's ontological difference (ontic/ontological) is the distinction between the phenomenal thing-in-itself (ding an sick), and Being--which is at once not phenomenal, yet
of the phenomenal world. The relationship between the subjective human being and human

Being is central to Heidegger's thinking, and each must be understood in terms of the other.
Human beings therefore are never simply things, and Being can never be apprehended in
objective terms. One of the central tasks of Heideggerian philosophy is to question and

articulate this difference, out of which a deeper understanding of self and world may be
generated. This understanding is revealed through ontological questioning. For Heidegger,

there are many modes of revealing (aleuthein) Being. Techne is one of the modalities of
revealing, because techne, along with logos participates in the constitution of what it means

to be human"1. Working out of classical philosophy, Heidegger demonstrates how Greek
conceptions of human wisdom (sophid) allow the potential of a deeper philosophical

understanding of self as Beinglv. However, techne will always remain dangerous for
Heidegger because anthropological technology (as scientific instrumentation and

rationalization) permits the coming to the fore of a destructive force (Gestellung) that reduces

the world to a thing (Weltbild) and that has the tendency to objectify human beingsv.

However, Heidegger's interpretation of the ancient Greek concept techne is problematic on at least two fronts: romanticism of Greek culture and conflation of modern technology with capitalist praxis. The first criticism that may be leveled at his argument in The Question
Concerning Technology is that he has misinterpreted Greek techne by seeing it as synchronous with physis. This conceptualization does not cohere with what we know

archaeologically about the Greeks, which is that they did not live "in harmony" with nature, but were rather actively transforming their physical wdrld. The process of objectification that ,

Heidegger identifies in modernity has already begun with the Greeksvl. Indeed, the movement
from immanent to transcendental forms of divinity is a potential pre-requisite for such an objectification, because the world cannot be de-consecrated unless it is no longer inherently
divine. Large-scale urbanization, as evidenced by the Greek pblis produces the necessary physical schism, one in which human beings no longer live in a natural setting, but in one

built of human artifact. Although Greek architecture is based on natural forms, it is a
distillation of these forms, and as such it places a sign between the observer and the

phenomenon. A column stands in for a tree, but it is no longer a tree, and the sacred significance of the sacred grove of Apollo is transformed into a single Corinthian marble column, a ithyphallic sign that is not inhabited by the god, but rather stands in for him in the world (as he now inhabits distant Olympus).

The second criticism of Heidegger's devaluation of modern technology begins with

Heidegger's astute but problematic observation that modern technology is not technics.

interpreted and understood on its own terms, apart from the objectifying processes of modern capitalism. The problem, as it presents itself here lies in the tension between systemic and individual approaches to an understanding of being in the world, between subject and object.

The simultaneous systemic and atomic nature of being-in-the-world generated by the
subjective experience provides some difficulty and resistance, and this problematic will be analyzed through a basic temporal lens that views both linear and cyclical concepts as significantly important to an evolutionary perspective on the phenomenon. Simply put, thesp two ways of understanding time derive from the inherent perceptive nature of the lived

experience of subjects. Cyclical time represents a culturally mediated but naturally
influenced life-world experience of the temporal that is common to hunter-gatherer and

agricultural societies, (although the latter is already in the progression and sway of the

technical transition to linear time)vn. This is also mythic time, in that there is an immediacy
of experience that is also an immanence, in which subjects are "closer" to the rhythms of

nature that are themselves cyclical and recurringvin. Linear time is the time of the technical,
or more precisely of the techniques of writing and of history (and by extension, the clock),

which impose a transcendental limit of origin and end on the life-worldlx. These two
temporalities as perceptions coexist simultaneously in the historical period. They are neither
definite nor complete, but are rather aspects of temporal experience that colour the manner in which we apprehend our own temporal experience.

abstraction of a longer and more ancient process that dissimulates itself behind the discrete

and individual nature of subjective experience). It is the theoretical differentiation of Being from beings that provides the elan for this process and it is from this discussion (as a kind of non-dual and integral whole) that ontological conclusions concerning the techno-logical
being will be ultimately drawn. However, this is not to imply that this perspective is absolute, because it requires of essence the simultaneous consideration of what is frequently

established as an opposing point of view. It is here that the combined perspectives of Steigler
and Kittler will be of most use. The review of the literature will help to situate this discussion

within the larger context of continental thought. Subsequently, a detailed discussion of the
work of Steigler and Kittler with respect to the four key tropes of monster, metaphor,

memory, and medium will help to frame the discussion of Being, technics, and ultimately
allow an articulation of the phenomenon of communication as a core ontological process.

1.1 Terminology:

This paper employs terminology current to a phenomenological approach to philosophy as

well as selected neologisms. Thus, eleinents of the Greek lexicon explicate concepts from within the tradition, and infrequently German and French expressions are also used.
Wherever possible and desirable, the English translations are given, although they are meant

only to approximate the original contextual usages. The difficulty in translating these terms adequately poses some problems, but it is taken for granted that the translations themselves

brevity, but wherever possible, quotations from source material are in the endnotes.

Time is primarily discussed in terms of the cyclical and linear conceptions. While both
manners of perceiving time from within still exist in the social world (relativity demonstrates

the lack of an objective sense of time), this discussion will artificially separate linear time

from cyclical time in the discussion for expediency's sakexl. This is because the relationship
between the two basic distinctions forms a much more complex and rich field of investigation than can be elucidated here. Of importance is an understanding that the concept of linear time developed here should not be taken in opposition tp cyclical time, but rather bound to it in a particular and indefinite fashion. Of course, cyclical time is in a sense, linear,
in that it follows the general physical flow of generation and corruption. However, what is

germane here is the perception of time that is dominant in a given cultural or historical period. In the present, human time is not technical time, but we are bound to a technical perception through our use of technology--our temporal perception is therefore primarily

teleological. This is to say nothing more than the mechanics of the clock and calendar create f"
a kind of existential linearity that defines in part our temporal experience.

The perception of natural human time (as primal time) is predominantly cyclical in trajectory,
and it is the externalization of memory (hypomnematization) by technics and the development of history as a science that accents the linearity of temporal experience.

that may be distinguished from a primal and instinctual existence in physis is the pre
condition of history).

What is precisely technical in this sense is also temporal, in that writing, (Plato discerned that

it is at least in part the domain of the dead) both inaugurates history and destroys mythical

time. The death, so to speak that is presaged sotto voce in antiquityxiv but not spoken aloud
until Nietzsche is the death of god, or more specifically of the sacred and immanent myth of

eternal return to origin that is cyclical temporal experience. The dreamtime experienced by

Australian aborigines (before the origin) is orie of the vestiges of this way of seeing, one that
in the Western present is almost wholly subsumed in the linear temporal mechanics of

capitalist productionxv. The ontological crisis of (post) modernity is simultaneously one of
obscene distance and horrible proximity. It is the ineffable distance of the divine corpse and

of mythic origin and of the radical proximity of death and of end to all things that announces the sublimation of the human subject in the total rationalization of the life-world. It is this urgency generated by (post) modern temporal experience that is significant to this work.

The ground/horizon pairing that emerges from linear and historical time refers to the condition of possibility and the scope of potentiality of a given concept. While both are necessarily irrationally defined systems (that is their borders are both semi-permeable and indistinct), it is still possible to understand a given phenomenon (like linear, finite time) as

having both a ground and a horizon (cyclical, infinite time). The subtle difference between

Origin (arche) and end (telos) relate to ground and horizon, except that these form atomic
rather than systemic expressions of the same concept pair. Of course, the meaning that we

impart to these terms is purely subjective, in that they have no real objective validity. It is only from within the subjective human experience that any kind of understanding of origin
and end can emerge, and even this is confounded by the empirical and scientific evidence

that shows the subject to be a continuum rather than a discrete objectXV11. Although these
terms are often employed objectively, Derrida (after Heidegger and Husserl) has demonstrated in his essay Differance and in Of Grammatology why the arche/telos cannot be

taken objectively, but must ratter be (also) understood negativelyTM111. These terms are used
both with reference to Greek philosophy, and to recent ontological wtfrk, with the result that

it may seem confusing. What is crucial to a proper understanding of this thesis is that the application of non-dual methodology in the paper produces an inevitable teleological (and j

therefore archeo-logical)xlx movement. This is because systems, by their very definition
through study, always already possess simultaneously cyclical and linear vectors of origin and end as such, even if they axe perceived as indeterminate or irrational.

Systems therefore, will be presented here in a quasi-objective manner. As will be discussed, a

given phenomenon can be investigated from both a systemic and atomic perspective.
However, to isolate a system, to render it an object of study (to differentiate it from its

(

ground) is in a sense to always already make it artificial. This specific concept of artificiality as it relates to the discussion can be worked out in terms of both the noetic and poeitic

memory itself, but which only emerges into the sphere of the human as the direct result of human technical activity. This activity will be explored in order to determine not only how memory comes into being as an essential condition of the human, but also of how its

transference into the technics makes possible the technical being, or being-technical.

Technics is the historical complex of both technical objects and technical thought, and may
be interpreted of as an English equivalent of the Greek techne. It is thus both noesis (as thought) andpoeisis (as production), both that produce ideation, and the notion of an eidos

(Stiegler and Kittler both will distance themselves from Platonic forms and Aristotelian

hylomorphism which they view as unnecessarily divisive)xx. Technology in this sense
conveys the same meaning, as it is both techne and logos, but in the manner that it will be used in this paper, refers more specifically to machines as things. When something is said to be techno-logical, the purposeful division is intended to call attention to the root words that make up the term. The potential confusion between the terms arises partially in the sometime

nebulous attributions and translations from Aristotle and Plato, but also more notably in the ? sedimentation of meaning and the expectation placed upon them by a modern readership. Compounding the problem is that technology can simultaneously be thought of as systemic and atomic, such that it is frequently viewed by many as prosthetic or placed before the subject, but not integral to her (and hence of less ontological significance than logos, which

is literally "inspired", the product ofpneurna, or the human soul). The detailed discussion

it contains them, and the meaning of each evolves through the shift from chthonic and immanent forms of conceptualization in Greek antiquity to more transcendental understandings of the natural and human world of the late Hellenistic period. As such, physis

or cosmos forms the ground from which human being, culture, technics and philosophy
emerges, and while both are universal in a sense, the former is taken to mean more immediately the natural world of the planet, where the latter refers most explicitly to the universe, although the former is indeed & physical expression of the latter. Because, physis
does not carry with it any logocentric potential, it is to physis that the paper will refer when

discussing the relationship between human culture, technology, bid Being and the natural
ground with the express caveat that this does not imply either a personification of the natural
world, or an objective reduction of the same. ^

Pertinent to all the previous concepts is the notion of measure. Metricity (metron) or rationality (ratio) also forms a significant aspect of the Western tradition. Tl^e ability to
concretely measure space and time, apart from being foundational to Western science,

originally spring themselves from philosophical dualism, and in no small part the
subject/object distinction. This is not to suggest that non-dualistic frameworks cannot utilize

^

notions of measure. Rather, it illustrates how in the Western tradition, metricity comes to
usurp all other ways of seeing through the global spread of objective science and capitalist economics (all the while 'paradoxically' and simultaneouslyfounded on a deeper irrationality). Mathematics lies at the heart of rationalism, and while a discussion of the

20

relationship of mathematics to language and technics is extremely important, it is both beyond the ability and scope of this investigation to elaborate in detail. What must be kept in mind are the essential nature of the mathematical language, and its fundamental place in an objective technical system such as the one in which we currently operate. Mathematics is the language that allows the generation of modern communications phenomena, and as such is deeply significant to any study of technics, although beyond the specific purvey of this paper.

Therefore, the argument that will be developed in this paper is that communication is the core phenomenon that, as language (logos) and media (techne), noesis and poiesis (thought and expression)XXii is that which reveals (aleuthein)XXiii not only the movement or the trace of Being, but also the temporal (and therefore historical) structures ofthe evolution of the system(s) of Being. If communication can be said to be the primary phenomenon that situates and constitutes Being or a being (ta onta), then technology is irreducibly its means (medium). Immediate and significant support for this formulation can be found etymologically. The word 'tecpnology' is built from two Greek terms: techne and logosXXiV, which may be translated respectively 'craft' and 'speech', (or crafting and speaking, in the active form)Xxv. Thus, this approach integrates the internal and the external worlds, uniting noesis and poiesis, and subordinating both logos and techne to them. From this initial philosophical re-working, the investigation will pursue the thematic of Being in order to clearly articulate the place of technics, and thus the technological being with respect to it.

21

The medium may be understood as a kind of metaphor (metapherein: to carry over). But it is not merely a vessel, because the medium also inherently transforms the message that it conveys it produces difference (diapherein: to differ). This is the (McLuhanesque) dual role

of the metaphor; that which compares one thing to another, one domain to another through
transportation and transformation. The world is therefore always already mediated (as it is always already understood by human subjects through the use of language and technics), and in a very significant way, a kind of system of metaphors. It is impossible to speak or think of
what simply is (but yet this impossibility is the very condition ofthe human). The qualitative

and quantitative aspects of the life-world are precisely the product of mediated, subjective access. The act of thinking is itself also metaphorical, as is the act of speaking, or making, in that there are always already 'carrying over' and transformations of what is by the (human) agent. It is this dual role of transportation and transformation that will be not only significant to the understanding of the problematic of communication as a kind of system of Being, but also fundamental to the overall methodological approach of the inquiry.

In this manner, both logos and techne function themselves as metaphors, and as systems of metaphor. A problem of definition emerges from this formulation in that every attempt to

define the object of study potentially further relativizes and obscures it. Definition is in a
very real sense the artificial and objective determination of a process that is not objective, but in always in flux. It is arguable that the application of a non-dual methodology that at once

22

recognizes the systemic and atomic nature of the life world without privileging either position will obtain results that allow for a deeper and clearer understanding of the basic ontological problems with regard to the objects/processes in question. It is also likely that it is precisely the bias towards one or the other perspective and an insistence on the fundamentally dual nature of the (non-dual) life-world that has, in a profound manner, been generative of both positive and negative socio-cultural movements and phenomena in the Western world. This is similar to the thesis advanced by Innis in Empire and

Communication, although his argument is that it is the material of a medium that is of
primary significance. However, the success of a given medium links to technical developments tied to scientific discoveries predicated on biased dualistic knowledge systems.

The problem of definition cannot be resolved objectively nor can it be simply left in a subjectivist morass.
Furth~r,

any given 'object' can be interpreted from an atomic or a

processual perspective. Neither the objectivist stance oflogical positivism (the thinkers ofthe Vienna Circle), nor the relativist discourse of such luminaries as Fran<;ois Lyotard and Michel Foucault solved the problem of definition. It is probable that Ludwig Wittgenstein comes the closest to a proper working understanding of the conundrum when he suggests that language need not be definite to be precise in the Philosophical InvestigationsXXVi However, the question that remains largely unanswered in Wittgenstein (because at this point he feels that such questions are philosophically unanswerable) is how language comes to be both precise and indeterminate at the same time. It is this deeper question about the fundamental

23

nature of being-in-the-world that resonates in the core of this investigation and work. The manner in which we choose to privilege either an objectivist or at subjectivist, atomic or systemic stance does has significant impact on the kinds of observations and conclusions that we both make, and are capable of making with respect to a given problem.

The problem, as it has been formulated in the continental tradition is that the impasse between systems of discourse and rhetoric, or aporias has produced paradoxical situations in which the discourses themselves seem to fail. Derrida asks us, in his essay Differance to
contemplate the margins of the text, (the boundaries of a discourse about Being) that are necessarily nebulous, because the trace of Being itself is a forgetting, a negation, a non-

concept--a doubled disappearance*TM11. However, it is precisely the negative aspect of Being
to which both Heidegger and Derrida ascribe the impetus of the movement of Being (as a

system of differentiation and deferral) itselfxxvin. The relative problem of observation and of
subjective finitude is the crucial issue in this discourse, the impossibility of self-knowledge
as a definite object (because we cannot know the limits of our own being as Being) produces

the impossibility (impassability) of any knowing in an objective sense.

Modern empirical science, (and empirical philosophy that is grounded in evolutionary principles), claim the objective high ground, and are seemingly irreconcilable with deconstruction, providing no potentialfor passage. The following philosophical solution is to

incorporate all perspectives in one fundamental stancexxlx. Although Slavoj Zizek comes

24

close to this with his Hegelian and Lacanian construction of the parallax, (as does Heidegger post Being and Time), there still remains a nagging inability of the Western mind to

understanding paradox in non-dual terms because the history of philosophy and science is

exactly the working out and the codification of those systems of difference***. What is being
rather mundanely proposed here is that the life-world is at once both objectively and

subjectively constituted, and is also both atomic and systemic in nature. This process of
understanding aims to eliminate the historical dualities of Western though through a careful reconciliation with non-dual philosophy and a theoretical explanation thereof.

1.2 Methodology:

In very basic terms, non-dualism denies the fundamental distinction between subject and
object. Of course, this remains a theoretical postulate, as subjective fmitude precludes a true

dissolution of this distinction. However, what this approach does offer is a means towards understanding the world and its phenomena in both systemic and atomic senses. This is
important because it allows the integration and interpretation of systems of thought that

appear on the surface to be purely antagonistic (if taken in isolation from either perspective). Science and continental philosophy are two such examples. While much continental
philosophy critiques scientific pbjectivism, scientific objectivists reject the critique on the

grounds that it is empirically baseless. Non dualism resolves the impasse by permitting both
the objectivist and subjectivist perspectives, not only for methodological reasons, but more

25

significantly because non-dualism and the aporias that are generated in thinking the problematic are themselves seen as fundamental. The logical positivist philosophers working

at the close of the 19th century sought an empirical and logical base for language. They
discovered that while language has logical elements, and is therefore rational, that it is also significantly irrational. This produced and impasse that resulted in the abandonment of the project. This methodological discussion approaches non-dualism as both the source of and solution to dualistic thought. In this sense, the methodology mirrors the arc of the historical
and theoretical heritage explored in the paper, and this is deliberate. The work of Heidegger is invaluable as a point of departure in the tracing of the development of non-dualism in the
West, and to a clearer understanding how it is pertinent to this project.

In his later work, Heidegger attempts to move his entire ontological project towards a purely

non-dual systematicxxxl. Working out of the continental tradition and classical hermeneutics,
the grand arc of his philosophical narrative begins and ends with the question of Being. For the late Heidegger, the question of Being, cannot be understood or interpreted either positively or negatively, nor can it be considered from within the traditional subject-object

framework. It must rather be embraced in its totality as both positive and negative, subject
and object, singular and plural. Being, for the late Heidegger is beyond the totality of human

being, but also paradoxically that Being that is accessible through and by authentic being-in-

the-worldxxxn. The ontological questioning he opens up in Being and Time, as to the nature of
beings and Being begins with an assessment of the non-being of beings, and of Being. This

26

"groundless" aspect of life, which is death, surrounds and defines the existential experience of life, and subsequently hides, or obfuscates itself, so that the ontological presupposition is that beings and Being have only to do with living.

The more fundamentally non-dual approach offered by the later Heidegger will be adapted and modified in this project to provide a suitable foundation for an interpretation and elucidation of the larger ontological question in the context of technics and the technical (and indeed all media as techne). To that end, this paper considers not only the history of technology, but also of the potential technological being (and its relationship with/in Being). Non-dualism allows the simultaneous investigation of both the individual aspects of technical development and technicity as well as a critique of the artificial relationship between technology and human beings in order to produce a reading that recognizes the basic ontological unity of human beings and human products. In this manner, non-dual methodology unites all aspects of the life world under the banner of communications. Being is therefore the undifferentiated and differentiating unity of all that is. The articulation of the unit into categories is what is seen as problematic, because of the ontological primacy accorded to the human. Non-dual methodology in this application tries to overcome this bias by first de-centering the human and re-situating the technical, and then by collapsing transcendence and immanence, subject and object.

27

The basic recurring problem that is encountered in this application relates to the question of

time. The non-dual perspective is of essence extra, or supra temporal, in that it tak&s a
general view of an entire phenomenon. The subjective perspective isalways already bound in the horizon of the temporal, and therefore views discrete phenomena within the larger phenomenal context. The goal of the method is to reconcile the latter with the former in such a way so that the bias towards the subjective perspective is erased, or at least minimized. The issue at hand is that language, as a subjective and non-totalizing, but nonetheless infinite field
obscures the non-dual, and inherently privileges the subjective and dual reading of the world. The Husserlian project of philosophical epoche, or suspension does not achieve the goal for which it was intended, because even that experience is subjectively bound. Derrida shows us

in Differ'ancexxxm why the transcendental remains always over the horizon of what is
perceivable, and in this sense, this method can only be an ideal template, because the human
is always already inextricably bound up in the horizon of the temporal.

Zizek is deeply critical of Heideggerian ontology and Derridian differance specifically because their construction of the ontological difference displaces the ethical through its

totalizing effectsxxxlv, although he acknowledges that his Hegelian-Lacanian construction of
the parallax as fundamental to philosophy resembles in many ways the concept of aporia

(blockage) articulated by Derrida as the impasse between the understanding of the self as being and of the (non) trace (sous rature) of Being. Even considering the flaw elaborated by

Zizek, the non-dual methodology proposed in this paper is useful, because it allows us to

Dualism, as a means of perception requires first the differentiation between the self and the
world. In The Wooden Horse, Zeruneith shows how Homer begins to articulate this

difference occurring in early Greek thoughtxxxvn. A purely immanent, chthonic mode of life
related to hunting and gathering does not generate a significant and objective differentiation between nature and its creations. Urbanization and agriculture definitively places the medium of culture and cultural artifact between the human being and the world, thereby producing an awareness of difference, and the conditional possibility of the transcendental divine. This transformation is evident, according to Zeruneith in the trajectory from the Illiad to the Oddysey, and more precisely from Achilles to Odysseus. The former does not act independently of the gods, and is thus quasi-divine. However, the latter rejies on his metis or "craft" , and it is this craftiness that makes him unique among heroes--he is not simply a vessel of divine will. This characteristic of introspection is at once new to Greek thinking, and the beginning of rational thought. The shift in Greek religious thought from the chthonic gods of the earth to Olympian gods of the sky shows the general movement away from purely immanent forms of religiosity. Although the gods are not yet fully transcendental

(after all, they still inhabit the world), they are at a remove, and this provides the space for the "fallen" to pick up and make their own decisions. This notion of the fall is almost ubiquitous in world cultures, and it is frequently presented as a fall into technics. The primordial Eden or illud tempus that is fundamental to many cultures is a place either before time began, or a mythical point of origin in which the human being was quasi-divine. The fall is understood as a fall into technics, in that the knowledge that is required to build

30

and sustain tools is seen as the very cause of that fall in the first place. Extrapolating back, these myths potentially echo a deep genetic memory of a time before tools, in which human beings were "in harmony" with nature. Of course, this mythology of the protean origins of humanity is itself a kind of fantasy predicated on a half-truth, which is that biological beings are somehow reduced by the use of technical objects. The knowledge of the tool and its use is therefore seen as somehow unnatUfal, and worthy of divine punishmentXXXviii. Indeed, the uniqueness of the tool using animal would have been self-evident to human beings for millennia before writing, so much so as to become imbricated in the fabric of human story telling and existence. Tool use brings great rewards, but also great responsibility, because once human beings began to make and use tools habitually, they became dependent on themxxxix . In addition, technics displaces instinctual behaviours (of food gathering, mating, sheltering) so much so that the latter are ''forgotten'', or more precisely dissimulated.

In Greek mythology, (as Stiegler points out in Technics and Time-THe Fault of

Epimetheus), this fall is expressed in the Prometheus (prometheia-forethought) myth.
Epimetheus
(epimetheia~afterthought)

was charged with handing out all the attributes at

creation, and when he got to mankind, he realized that he had nothing left over. This original "forgetting" (anamnesis) provides the &;'ckdf6p for the Promethean tragedy-Prometheus steals fire and thus technical wlsdom (techne,) from Zeus and is punished for it. This ancient myth already presents the acquisition of technics as part of a fall from the natural, and it is also already linked by the fall to the condition of memoryXI. PlatQJtranscribes this myth (and

31

its inherent critique of technics) in the Protagoras', and extends this line of thought in his
invective against the technics of writing in the Phaedrus.

This myth also traces the demarcation between conceptions of the divine nature of the human

being and the heroic phase, the loss of which is inscribed incHdmer's Iliad--a doubled falling from grace. The dual movement of the human being into mortality is diametrically opposed to the ascent/replacement of immanent chthonic. gods to transcendental Olympian status, and
it is technics that facilitates this movement. The dualisms that spring forth from this
originating (but not original) movement (between subject and object, emotion and reason,

self and other) provide impetus and the challenges in the" history of the development of the Western mind. The Promethean fall into technics is paralleled in Zeruneith's analysis of the characters of Achilles and Odysseus. Achilles is the representative of an old, semi-divine and heroic tradition (in which the self does not differentiate between an inside and an outside, but

Although non-dualism is seemingly foreign to science, it is not anathema to Western modes of thought. Quantum mechanics relies on this precise reasoning in order to more clearly

explain some basic elements of the physical world. Wave-particle duality is a phenomenon of
quantum particles (electrons, for example) that requires a perspective shift to non-dualism in order to be properly understood. Essentially, any quanta can exhibit, under given

32

observational conditions, either wave or particle like behaviour. The stunning conclusion that physicists who were grappling with the problem in the early part of the 20th century reluctantly came to is that quanta are neither waves nor particles, but simultaneously both, and how they manifest themselves depended wholly on how they were observed by a human

subject in a given experimental situation. Bertrand Russell makes similar observations with

respect to the duck-rabbit, which is a drawing that may be seen as either a duck or a rabbit depending on the viewer's perspective. The postulate is that it is only perceptually one or the other although this claim is rather dubious (stereoscopic images can be seen through a relaxation of the eyes without the proper lenses, just as the simultaneous perception of two fundamentally different images is also possible )xJij.

However inscribed these dualisms are in our mode of thinking, there are tantalizing areas in which they can be understood and challenged. For example, in his ethics, Aristotle champions both reason and emotion as the necessary sources of virtue. He does not oppose them as he does logistikon and epistemonikon (that which can be otherwise, and that which cannot), or logos and techne (speech and craft), but rather sees them as an integral whole. Though the passions are by definition irrational, they exist in conjunction with the faculty of reason, and virtue (arete) is not possible without the one informing the other. Our present modalities of thought generally find this situation intolerable, yet there is nothing inherently oppositional in the pairing. Just as we tend to misconceive qualitative emotions like happiness (The Greek term eudaimonia or happiness means literally "to be possessed by

33

good demons") and sadness as diametric opposites, we also tend to oppose reason and emotion as if they were quantifiably and qualitatively opposite.

Non dualism addresses these inconsistencies that the Western tradition takes for granted and
provides an alternative solution--namely that we should abandon the oppositional

framework in favour of a unified perspective that sees traditional binaries not as dialectics,
not even as joined elements but as one and the same thing. This is not to deny or to ignore the essential role that dualism has played in the evolution of Western thought and of technics (episteme and technics). It is to rather challenge the artificiality of the situation in order to
move beyond the error it engenders--the conflation of a necessarily limited way of seeing

with a larger reality. From this point of view, it is possible to argue that neither
corresponding philosophical position is inherently correct, and that each produces a bias that can only be understood through a careful investigation of the manner in which the overrepresentation or under-representation of the particular given perspective generates the mis

appropriate understanding of the phenomenon at hand.

It is arguably these biases that produce, throughout the history of the Western world, the

larger movements and actions of culture and cultures*1"1. What is therefore required is not
only a clear understanding of the manner in which the subjective is not just simply bound up in the objective, but in a real sense part of the same unity and also of the grand historical movements within which the dualistic perception of each operates. Thus, any resolution to

Heideggerian Being, from the communications studies perspective advanced in this paper, may be understood through tripartite terms: as beings (individuals), as their productions (technology), and as their utterances (language). Of course, Being escapes these horizons, and is forever a more profound and abstract notion than can be properly apprehended in the subjective state. It cannot be grasped in an objective manner. This conceptualization is
merely a means through which the prioritization of any given element may be understood and

critiqued--it is also a conscious attempt to diffuse the habitual dualism and highlight the
systemic aspects of Being. In this way, Being may be related to culture, although in this sense, culture intends all human cultures generally as a unit (while recognizing the unalienable differences that exist between them), and it emerges from the ground of physis without being in opposition to it. The crucial issues in this interpretation involve the solid

definition of the three realms, and a proper understanding of how they inter-relate. There is
already extensive theoretical work done in all three areas, and in this sense, this work is
merely a synthesis of this material.

This synthesis is based on a broad range of inter-related theory. While each theorist or body of work may be categorized into one of the three areas, it must be understood that these

categories are not firm, but fluid. Indeed, the intertwining of the three elemental strands of
r

theory cannot be dissected in a purely technical manner, as the questions themselves are not

mutually exclusive. This review intends a proper and cogent placement of this tripartite

Critique ofPure Reason and Critique ofJudgment together lay the foundations of the divide

between analytic and what is termed somewhat misleadingly "continental" philosophyx v.
Both branches would eventually focus decisively on language as a means to answer fundamental questions, but would diverge as to what in fact these questions were. The

analytical camp (Carnap, Wittgenstein, Frege) dismissed questions about ontology and

metpahysics as being 'without meaning'xlvn or unanswerable, white the other thinkers of the
Continent (Hegel, Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty) worked in a very methodical and considered manner towards a structured answer to the age-old question of Being.

Hegel, working at the cusp of the 18th and 19th centuries, is one of the first Western
philosophers to bring back primarily ontological questions about the nature of the human

being to the forefront of philosophyxlvin. His development of Geist or spirit is deeply
important for the later development of ontological thinking on the Continent. Hegel's

dialectics and methodology provide the foundational ilnpetus for a vast range of continental thinkers, from the Marxists, who base their materialist philosophy in Hegelian dialectics, and
the Phenomenologists who develop their ontological metaphysics at least in part as a reaction to Hegelian thought. In particular, Edmund Husserl develops very significant and structured

ideas about the nature of human being and human thought in several of his works. Of significance to this study is his treatment of ideal objects in The Origins of Geometry, (which
would later influence Jacques Derrida). As well, Heidegger was one of Husserl's most

on our understanding of the nature of Being. Because beings are temporally bound, they are always in a process of becoming. There is always a movement inherent in human being, and this movement, according to Heidegger, is always out of and against the nothing-ness that
surrounds it. His hermeneutic exploration of this ideology through classical Greek

philosophy is an attempt to trace the development of modern ontology out of its classical
roots. Heidegger's ontology provides the departure point for the move away from subjectcentered metaphysics towards a communicative, or linguistic based understanding of the

question. The central phenomenon that the later Heidegger privileges for the discovery of

human being is logos, or speech1". The relationship he establishes between communication
and beings, and to Being is elemental to the tripartite definition, because it is necessary in order to show how the subject as a being relates to any larger articulation of Being or

community. However, while one can think Being, it is not in practice comprehensible.
Beings are always already bound to the world in a certain fashion, and even authentic being

in the world maintains elements of the subjective experience.

Maurice Merleau-Ponty rarely discusses Heidegger directly1"1. However, his work, and in
particular The Phenomenology ofPerception, is deeply related to that of Heidegger. What Merleau-Ponty contributes is the inter-subjective understanding of Being that was perhaps
under-developed in Heidegger, whose exposition is more clearly dialogical. Merleau-Ponty

ushers in the full discursive turn in the Continental tradition by finally laying to rest the Cartesian notion of the subject (as Res Cogitans and Res Extensa) as the primordial

40

ontological unit and indeed of subjectivity itself. His re-articulation of the ontological question in terms of inter-subjectivity or the social is important to the tripartite definition of Being advanced in this section because it highlights the polysemic nature of Being and
underscores the further importance of language as a ground for Being as well. It also begins
to illustrate the importance of communications theory to current ontological thought.

From Heidegger, the importance of language as a means by which the ontological question
may be understood becomes clearer. As mentioned, it is quite impossible to separate out

language from any philosophical discussion, as language is indelibly the matrix through
which we communicate presently.

The relationship between language affcl medium is an interesting and problematic one that
has preoccupied many scholars in communications studies. Before examining how this theory is relevant to this work, it is first important to selectively discuss some more examples within the discursive turn in order to clarify the relationship between language, technology,
and beings. Language, along with technics forms the ground from which the social emerges.

The social may exist without language, but it is an undefined and non-reflexive kind of social

realm, in which individuals are cut off from it and each other--essentially mute. The awareness of the participation of other is present, but the ability to direct or to consciously
mediate that participation is ndt in any way efficient.

41

Language and technics are the now ancient developments that would change forever the way human social animals function. The ground of language and technics (as a complex) provides
the impetus for civilization itself, and the subsequent developments of writing, printing and

information technology all rely on it as a foundation. Communication is itself language,
beings and technics. The Frankfurt school and the philosophy of Jtirgen Habermas develops with the discursive turn, but also as a reaction against the Enlightenment and its effects in modernity, and the inheritance of Cartesian subject-based reason. Habermas' idea of
communicative reason is an attempt to salvage the project of the Enlightenment through an

appeal to inter-subjective or community based normative rationalitylv. Foucault turns to an
analysis of power and a hermeneutic excavation of the polysemous threads of history as a

i

^

means of uncovering and explicating important social and institutional threadslv. Derrida
begins to suggest an even more radical deconstruction of the subject in his essay Differance^ which at once points towards the problem of meaning in language and the problem of Being itself. What is common to these widely differing theoretical approaches is aft increasing

awareness of systematicity as an important factor in the articulation of any philosophical
dialogue. From these threads, the systematic perspective that many current theorists advance emerges as a logical continuation of a stream of thought.

Modern communications theory also owes a great deal to two Canadians, Harold Innis and

Marshall McLuhanlvi. It is with a discussion of media and communications that terminates
the discussion of the tripartite ontological definition of Being significant to this study. The

42

systematic view allows for the excision of the subject in the determination of the ontological question. What this means is that the development of the isolated subject as a theoretical entity ceases to have any purchase within the context of philosophical discussion. This is not to suggest that individuals do not exist, rather that this existence, onto logically speaking is purely social and therefore constituted out of the interactions of the social realm, which are themselves communicative (technological and linguistic). The notion is not so counterintuitive as it would seem. Our existence is in fact deeply imbricated in the existence of others, most notably our immediate families, but also of any number of other human beings who help us to reflexively develop our identities through our interactions with them.

Innis was perhaps the first historian to understand the extremely important nature of communications with regards to the development of political, social, and cultural entities. His division of communications technologies along temporal and spatial lines allows for the first time a methodological understanding of how a medium will affect not only its contents, but the larger structures within which it operates. Thus, the bias of the medium, whether temporal or spatial, is richly determinate of the manner in which it will function. McLuhan adds to this picture by expanding the definition to include all artifacts. With this move, technology becomes part of communication along with language, because all technology or product of human action becomes communicative. The sense in which the medium becomes itself as significant as the message (to paraphrase McLuhan) is the final element upon which the tripartite ontological definition is based.

43

By the end of the 20th century, several scholars of media and technology were already
working in this vein, most notably Niklas Luhmann, Bernard Stiegler, and Frederich Kittler, and in Canada, Ian Angus. Both Luhmann and Stiegler work towards a further refinement and excision of the subject from the process of communication, choosing to radically refocus the debate around the question of systematicity and systems theory. In a radical move,
Luhmann insists that mediation means that only communication communicates, whereas Stiegler classifies the technologies of modern telecommunications as distinct systemic form of Being. Kittler proposes contra Stiegler and in line with Luhmann that the material aspect of communications technology cannot be understood in teleological terms, and that they ought to be interpreted from their own perspective. Angus provides an interesting bridge in Primal Scenes of Communication, where he brings together the three threads of language,

beings, and technology in his discussion of the phenomenon of communication1TM.

The process of discovery in the history of the development of communications theory,

ontology and socio-linguistic philosophy has arguably led to the point at which such a
determination is possible. Ontology provides the question, and the suggestion that Being is greater than one person, or subject. Communications theory shows the importance of media (and therefore technology) as it relates to language, which is already the ground of communal

Being, and socio-linguistic philosophy allows the full inter-subjective and systemic nature of the inter-relation between language, technology and Being as culture itself to emerge. The path that this development traces is both historically rich and epistemologically sound. It is

of which we feel deeply in the now with respect to the technology that surrounds us, wakes us, carries us, remembers for us, and in some cases, replaces us1x ·

Science fiction, like many other established genres, explores a diversity of themes. However, it is in particular the manner in which science fiction deals with questions of temporality identity, memory and technology that is germane. The purpose of this segment of the inquiry is to establish not only a link between the larger ontological question, which relates the place of the technological being to human being, but also to explore the manner in which this possibility is explored as possibility in the literature and film of science fiction. It serves as a concrete example of the philosophical potential of this kind of discourse, and it is very likely that the presence of this line of inquiry in popular culture during the age of science and of rapid, almost electric technological advance is not haphazard. Rather, may be argued that popular expressions in this case, as with others through the course of history relate to u,s deeply held cultural beliefs about the phenomenon in question, which in this case is technics, and more precisely, technological being.

The concepts of identity and ontology are bound up with questions of time, and- therefore of memory. The problem of memory as it relates to identity is a fundamental and originating theme in the literature and film of science fiction. The Promethean reference in the subtitle of Shelley'S magnum opus is directly related to these basic problems, and is significant with respect to the work of Bernard Stiegler, who views the torment of Prometheus as the

46

symbolic inauguration of measured time. In the punishment, the eagle sent by Zeus comes to rip out Prometheus' liver twice every day, (after which it regrows), and it forms a kind of "hepatic clock" of original linea; temporality out of quotidian cyclicitylxi. The question of linear time and of the historical with relation to technics and episteme are fundamental in the greater narrative of Western onto-theology, as it is temporality and our relationship to it as beings that is in a significant manner onto logically generative. Husserl discusses how objective ideation provides the basis of the historical and of historicity (and thereby linear time), while Heidegger teases his understanding of Being out of the finite temporal experience of the human. The unbinding of Prometheus that Shelley suggests (after Aeschylus-Victor Frankenstein is both a re-incarnation and re-iteration of the Promethean myth) in The Modern Prometheus is therefore a warning against the usurpation of space and time through technology, a caveat against the runaway technicity of Enlightenment.

Already in Shelley'S time, the workhouse and the "iron horse" were in the process of debasing and replacing human labour. William Blake's "dark satanic mills" had radically altered and darkened the landscape of England. This fertile ground of human misery is also the birthplace of Marx's critique of capital, in which is embedded a refutation of the rationalist and mechanist processes of industrial production that will be later taken up and refined by Marxist thinkers like Georg Lukacs. The becoming-technical of the human being in this sense is the reduction of the human to an element in a larger mechanical whole. , Industry becomes the technical mode through which linear and mechanical time are imposed

47

absolutely in the human world. This critique of the technical as the complete rationalization
of the human through the metricity of mechanical time resonates in later science fiction
works, (most notably in Lang's Metropolis), in which he features a scene with Freder, the

hero madly working/being worked to exhaustion by the arms of what appears to be a clock.
The labour he performs is seemingly pointless, and his Eventual collapse brings on a cataclysm in the complex in which he toils. This visual metaphor of a worker chained to a

clock is not haphazard. It is a trenchant critique of the industrial horrors of the 20th century
represented by metrical and rationalized time prophesized by Promethean myth.

The Marxist critique of reified capital is frequently conflated or combined with a rejection of

technics (as in Heidegger's The Question Concerning Technology). However, it is not
technology, or the industrial modes of production themselves that produce dehumanization, but rather the ideology of capitalism which creates an absurd logic of a humanity reduced through technical means. Advanced technology is the result of Empirical and Rationalist

science, and it has been put into the service of reified capital. Conversely, it is als6 the liberator of millions of people, as anyone who has ever used a household appliance or driven a car will attest. The purely negative critical response to technology cannot hope to properly
understand technology's role in and relationship to human society (let alone the possibility of

the technical being) because it improperly apprehends technics as a benign or malign force, not both. It is for this reason that the entire edifice of science fiction is useful in a elaborating

a non-dual understanding of the technical because it explores both tropes in detail. It is at

The fall into technics that is re-presented in Frankenstein also produces quite unexpectedly, the potential for a new innocence, and a return to a kind of primordial Eden. The monster,

like Phillip K. Dick's Roy Batty, (in both Dick's Do Androids Dream ofElectric Sheep and
Ridley Scott's cinematic adaptation Blade Runner) is not to be blamed in the end for extreme

viciousness, because it represents a being that does not possess true memory]xm. Again,
memory is constructed as the conditional of moral knowledge, and simultaneously the existential condition of the forgetting of the fall itself (or of the Platonic forms--anamnesis).

Aristotle, in antiquity has already demonstrated in the Nicomachean Ethics 4iow virtue is
acquired. It is the habituation of right action over time that both produces and encourages virtuous action, and the knowledge gained can only be produced as a consequence of

memory (indeed, virtue itself is only truly something that can be determined through the
memories of one's peers after death). A being without memory is necessarily a being without
virtue, because memory is the prerequisite of any knowledge, virtuous or otherwise.

\

However, memory is even more deeply constitutive of the ontology of human beings.

The crucial significance of memory in the constitution of the self is a recurring theme in
science fiction, and it is not an accidental one. The primary ontological question is always close to the problem of the technological being, as it is fundamental to any living being. The

problematization of the technological being and its ontological instability form the backbone of large swath of Japanese anime (Katsuhiro Otomo's Memories, or Mamoru Oshii's Ghost
In The Shell), a body of work that reflects the angst brought up in the work of Dick and

Frankenstein's monster possesses an adult body but is a mental child, while Dick's replicants are manufactured adults imbued with the memories of others-a technological deception which eventually produces an aberrant madness in both cases. The authors of each work go to great lengths to show that it is not the technical nature of the being that is to blame for the horrors it produces, but rather the human being who foolishly chooses to use the power of the

technical object that is beyond full comprehension (As Tyrell says of his "monster's" sinsnothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you into heaven for). In the end, Frankenstein's

monster disappears on an ice flow, abandoned and unloved, sacrificing himself, tind Batty

reflecting the humanity their human counterparts have failed to demonstrate. The ability of the technological being to repent and have remorse for its actions in both cases reflects a higher moral caliber than that of their human counterparts and subsequently allows us to question deeply our cherished and deeply held notion of a humanity seated in virtue. The explicit critique is that the technological offspring is in the end more capable of being human than are actual human beings. The implicit warning is that playing at god dehumanizes human beings, and that technical power requires proto-Promethean care.

perspectives, and the allegiances of the characters (and likely those who watch the show) are constantly forced to displace themselves along ill-defined and shifting partisan lines. Inherent to the text is a meditated critique of current human hubris, and a stark warning against the excesses of consumer culture and its associated cult of nihilism. The show is idiosyncratic in its relentless philosophizing, and as such, it is impractical to try and separate all of the twists
and turns in the narrative. This analysis focuses primarily on elements of the final two seasons, and examines the larger questions posed by both human and cylon characters with respect to the overarching question of Being. It is framed by a detailed discussion of the four
main tropes of the paper: Memory, Monster, Metaphor, and Medium. These terms, properly

explicated and refracted through the theoretical lens of the larger inquiry serve as a point of entry into a discussion of the ontology of the technological being.

This analysis of the programme provides the impetus for a detailed theoretical examination

of the issues surrounding technological being, and hopefully permits a rapprochement of
Steigler's teleological philosophy with the radical post-humanism proposed by Kittler. The basic non-dual solution is an attempt to address both antagonistic theoretical problems within the Western canon, and answer some basic critiques (both materialist and idealist) of

ontological philosophy itself. BSG traffics heavily in these questions, and of course, is deeply
indebted to its science fiction predecessors, in particular Blade Runner, which it references

liberally (through scripting and visual cues), and Frankenstein, the progenitor of and the metaphysical template for much of the thinking that directs/is directed by ontological

The series blends together elements of Homer's Odyssey, current politics and events, Greek mythology, and philosophical questioning. This heady mix is an elaboration of the original 1970's template, and the charm of the show is its ability to strike deeply into the psychological and metaphysical aspects of the human condition contrasted over and against the possibility of (bio)mechanical life. Ostensibly, the show is about a dystopian future, but underneath the elements of this narrative there lies a sustained and careful critique of post
modern capitalism and of humanity in general. After the destruction of the colonies, the

surviving humans mount an expedition to find the legendary planet of the lost thirteenth tribe
(called Earth). They number about 36,000, and they are hounded by the cylons repeatedly.

The series is full of betrayal, violence, and baroque plot twists in which the true nature of
ai

both human beings and cylon is revealed. There are cylon models in the human fleet that are
discovered over time, and the inability of the humans to recognize what they call "skin jobs",

(in a direct reference to Blade Runner) sets up an ontological tension that is sustained
through the show. However, it is not only the humans who undergo this process of

dissimulation and revelation, as the cylons also discover that they are the product of a secret

"final five" (the near-perfect human copies hidden in the human fleet) cylons. These cylons
are the creations of their mechanical forbearers (the cylon centurions) and they produced the

newer models of the current series to serve an obscure and esoteric religious purpose.

The central discourse that surrounds this twinned religious/ontological questioning is concerned with the notion of perfection, and the emergent (Judaeo-Christian) idea that the

and real mothers as a site of impregnation and towards fathers in a murderous rage, but also inward towards the self in a schizophrenic act of auto-castration and suicide. Human and cylon societies are plagued by civil war in the series, and the proffered solution involves the
rejection of the human/machine distinction and an embrace ofhybridity.

Out of this doubled and discordant narrative, emerges a secondary and perhaps contrapuntal Deleuzian anti-Oedipal reading--a reading in which the various disjunctive parts of the
whole do not work in harmony, or even disfunctionally in a Freudian sense, but rather

schizophrenically. The explicit critique in BSG of the human inability to behave humanely or to work in unison towards a common goal, (even when that goal is rationally the survival of
31

c
ill II

the species) resonates in the series. The question of extinction is addressed numerous times, through the mindless rage both cylons and humans express for one another, and in the philosophical musings of characters of both stripes, who openly wonder about the suitability

or the right of a given species to survive. The very notion of species is itself addressed and questioned through the relentless shifting of perspective and the continual reworking of the trope of hybridity towards the conclusion that all beings are always already hybrids.

From this perspective, the opening up of a path towards the understanding of the present

impasse in ontological studies is perhaps clearer. Within this notiofi of the hybrid, of the mixed mode is a trope that serves to explicate not only the ontologifeal problematic revealed by the crisis of the modern Cartesian subject but also of the fantasy of the objective in

58

general. Awareness of fmitude produces a sense of temporality that at once delineates the self
and obscures it. The transcendental limits of this experience can be apprehended, but never

reached. Consciousness and memory, as temporal phenomena do not allow us this luxury.
The movement of Being in this sense is part of a much larger arc of consciousness that is not located in any one being, but rather in the mass of beings that have been, are and will be. This continuum is hybrid, in that it is always of a something becoming something else.

The fantasy is therefore a doubled yet non-dual whole of subject and object, and the goal, as Heidegger notes is to seek truth, aletheia (itself an unveiling). Discovering truth in modernity is therefore not only the process of uncovering the human over and against the technical, or
technology, but rather the disambiguation of the relationship between the human and the technical and the realization of the essentially communicative nature of this process as a coming to the fore of Being, which in this sense may also be seen as an emergence from physis. However, to properly establish and situate these claims, it will first be necessary to

examine and criticize the work of Kittler and Stiegler in detail, and combine their systemic
and atomic approaches to define and discuss the significant relationships between memory,

monstrosity, metaphor, and medium as a means to a communicative ontological theory.

59

1.6 Friedrich Kittler:

Kittler's media studies engage technology from a distinctively material perspective. In this sense, Kittler is not primarily interested in content, but is rather concerned with elucidating
the ways in which the material form of the medium affects the culture within which it

operates1TM. In some ways, his work begins with Marshall McLuhan's contention that the
content of any medium is always another medium, although Kittler does not see media technologies as "extensions ofman", but rather as objects qua objects that must be apprehended on their own terms. For Kittler, it makes little sense to ask what are the human
affects of the computer, rather, it makes more sense to try and figure out how a computer
3

functions on its own terms (by contrast, Norbert Weiner, the father of cybernetics famously

subtitled his book on the subject The human uses ofhuman beings). From this point of
departure, it then becomes possible to see how we relate to the technologies we use without

falling prey to the assumption that the ontological relationship between human beings and technics is of necessity asymmetrical. The computer qua being, on this reading deserves
equal billing, and it is only by recognizing its alterity and ontological unity that we come to be able to elucidate structures of meaning that are otherwise obscured.

Kittler's work has been described as deeply post-humanist, in that it is a break from some of
the significant philosophical traditions of Europe, and in particular the historical aspect of

hermeneutics and ontologylxxn. He feels that it is technology and media that actively shape

natural phenomena beyond mere qualitative evaluation. Thus, it becomes possible to describe
the attributes of a circle or a triangle using precise formulae rather than rough measures. The

Pythagorean Theorem for example, is a product of this innovationlxxiv. What is significant in
this work is the establishment of numerals themselves as a kind of medium, and of the articulation of the place of mathematics within the philosophical and scientific canons. Even
more pertinently, Kittler also dismisses Aristotelian hylomorphism and logoc£ntrism in a

s

prescient look at the obscured roots of media studieslxxv.

Kittler's oeuvre is a means of access into a way of thinking the technological medium apart from the human, and it is in this sense an essential step towards the rehabilitation of

machines, and of techne in general as intellectually and ontologically valid. Kittler's
theoretical standpoint shares an "on the face" absurdity with Niklas Luhmann's cryptic

proposition that "only communication communicates"--from which he derives a sociology of communication divorced of the human subject. But what Luhmann is pointing to is the

fact that there is no un-mediated access to other selves, which is to say thaj the
communicative act itself remains a kind of fiction, because it has no secure epistemic foundation. Kittler suggests something not unlike this when he articulates a place for

technology outside of the human. Of course, for many people, there is something deeply

dissatisfying about these assertions. It would seem uncontestable that as the inventors of
machines, it is we who create them, not vice versa. Kittler has turned this conventional ,

wisdom on its head. While this is a useful exercise, it perhaps does not entirely capture the

Kittler's work. To be post-human in one sense is simply to imagine beyond the human
subject--which is always already a special kind of fiction.

Technology and media are at once objects and processes, and human beings are very little different in this respect. Our natural attitude is to describe or carve out discrete elements of
our surroundings that resolve out as such because of our sensory apparatus as real things.

However, they are also simultaneously ongoing natural processes of a very different order than a purely objective and discrete reality. Genetically speaking, humanity (and all life) is
always on the march, never static, and never singular. We can say for certain that DNA

belongs to one individual, but the examination of its constituent genes shows us how it
relates to others, frequently across millennia. Evolution is never simply "concerned" with the individual, but rather the whole. In addition, at the subatomic or even atomic levels, we know

that the distinctions between objects dissipate, despite sense data to the contrary. The point is that the material aspects of human culture are not simply productive of culture, or the products of that same culture. They are inherently both, and the exchange that exists in the cultural system, which comprises at least human beings, ideas, and media (technologies)

shapes these elements as information flows is transformed through the system over time. This is to say nothing more than there are two ways of looking at any given object of study; as an object in and of itself and as produced by/productive of both itself and the objects with which
it is associated, be these mechanical, ideological, or human.

than a full rehabilitation of technics, and establishes that technical development, and thus the

development of media (as technical systems) in general is the development of a phylogenic
system that is in an important manner external to the human being.

The "secret" history of machines is therefore the development of a technical phylogeny away

from the genetic model, but yet based on it, in that it possesses its own internal^and
differential logic. From the genetic emerges the phylogenetic, in which technical phyla begin
to propagate based not solely on human or natural conditionals but rather due to their own

internal logic, a logic which is dictated by the functional and physical constraints and

properties of the objects themselves. Archaeology reveals this serial development not merely
as an evolution of style, but more significantly of functionality as well. The shape of a pot is

constrained by its function, and the physical properties of the substance it is to contain, and of the properties of its material source. Any technical evolution of form is thereby constrained--the possibilities are not infinite, but rather finite (not everything can be a pot),

and the resulting phylogeny may be explained in terms of these termini ante post qualxxvm.
Simultaneously, the knowledge that is necessary for the production of the pot, from procurement to finish, becomes externalized in a hypomnematic fashion as a technical

systemlxxix. The knowledge is not merely passed down in written or spoken form; it is also
inscribed in the very objects themselves and in their progression through time. In this sense,

From Stiegler's perspective, it is possible to build a kind of teleology of the technical, one
that relates to and is conjunctive with the Heideggerian/Derridian trace of Being. What

Steigler is careful not to do is to moralize on this development. Rather, he provides a sustained mediation on the necessity of recognizing this reality, and developing strategies for
coping that do not ignore the very process itself. Therefore it is simply not sufficient to critique the ongoing development of the technical, but rather to understand it on its own terms as significant to Being. Part of the process, according to Stiegler (as with Kittler) is the dismantling of Aristotelian hylomorphism, which is the dualism responsible, among other things for the hierarchical division between the material and the ideal, where the latter is^ prioritized at the expense of the former. His work is demonstrative of the genitive (the third

voice of Derridian differance) necessity that technics provide in the human experience, and
that technical evolution is in part a human evolution as well.

Critiques leveled at Stiegler notably include charges of techno-determinism, anti-empirical

bias and the conflation oiphysis with the quasi-transcendental differance. While it is not
possible to address all of the critical response to his work, these three merit a closer look, not

in the least because they are resolvable either in terms of explicating what may be mis interpretations, or by expanding on Stiegler's original lines of thought. In dealing explicitly with the possibility of a post-human technical being in the context of an epiphylogenesis (which is a species of evolution), Stiegler does indeed open himself up to the criticism of

technological determinism. However, his reading is not simply a positive inscription of this

68

system into the human world, it is rather a sustained meditation on what he feels is an actuality, and the point of departure for a questioning about the place and the role of the human within the increasingly binding structures of power the techno-scientific regime imposes on human life. In this sense, he joins with Kittler in trying to elucidate, against and outside of the human the place of human beings in the world that they have created. Is this techno-determinism? One might as well say that evolution implies bio-determinism, although that is to say very little, because any system analyzed from a systemic perspective is of essence deterministic, which is after all, a characteristic of any teleology.

It is possible to twice answer the question of anti-empirical bias. To begin, we exist within an

empirical context, and the history of techno-science is also the history of empirical observation. Any discussion of technicity from the Greeks, and most certainly after the Enlightenment would be strangely odd without maintaining any connection to empirical research and work. Continental philosophers tend to work within their own tradition. As such, Stiegler makes impressive use of a wide swath of materials in the development of his thesis. As philosophy, it is primarily geared towards a philosophical audience. While it does not reference the hard sciences in abundance, it also does not discount them, and there is no reason why his work should be incompatible with empirical research. The second involves a
re-con~ideration

of Stiegler's work, which makes explicit reference to the (quasi)

transcendentalist philosophies of Derrida and Heidegger. Although Stiegler chooses to avoid .the larger ,ontological implications in this work, and in particular Derrida's Of

69

Grammatology, and Heidegger's The Question Concerning Technology and The Age ofthe World Picture, it does riot mean that he is unaware of the implications of his work. To the contrary, it is more likely that the inherently ontological nature of the epiphylogenetic postulate presents Stiegler with a conundrum--how to announce the advent of the
technological being when the cyborg is the object of derision and frequently a locus of theoretical and representational lassitude?

The question of the conflation of differance with physis may be resolved in respect to the
previous problem. Although Stiegler articulates physis as nature, and specifically the natural

world of the Greeks, this does not a priori preclude the idea that it could be more. Cosmos

contains physis, but there is no reason why physis cannot in a meaningful way be expanded
to include cosmos, especially in light of modern scientific discoveries. Derridian differance, in this sense can also be expanded to express fundamental physical realities (an argument which Derrida presages in his text), from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, to the wave-

particle duality function first encountered by Ernest Rutherford (Derrida intends differance as

a kind of quasi-transcendental operative)lxxxi. The potential of the ontological difference is
already inscribed in the physical world--and the natural world and the social world derive from it. His narrowing down of the terms is specifically within the Greek context, and has to
do exactly with the Promethean/Epimethean myth, a point that he identifies as generative of a history of the relationship between human beings and technics, and thus definitive of modern

human beings. Of course, there is nothing in this that excludes a further extrapolation of the

For technics, (as with the human subject) this means that contingency and determinacy "inhabit" the same space in such as fashion as to be integral to one another. The machine therefore, like the human being must be both apprehended as an isolated object on its own
terms and as an expression of a larger systemic movement. At the genetic level, the human being ceases to exist, and indeed, the very question of species falls into doubt. There is no
way a posteriori (or a priori for that matter) to determine what constitutes Homo sapiens. We

can point to ourselves and say: "This is human", and to skeletons of our ancestors and say "This is not", but the line between H sapiens and H. habilis simply does not exist, except as
a morphological fantasy based on discrete and incomplete typologies constructed out of the

objective analysis of lithified remains. The machine, like the human, is always already in the process of becoming, based on older forms that in turn are evolving into new ones. The object therefore must always be understood in terms of this process, as an expression of potential that is ephemeral and yet significant.

One species becomes another, and this process descends to the protoplasm that spawned all
planetary life. Even then, the drawing of the atomic point of demarcation is simply

impossible, as the proteins that make up DNA themselves are based on earlier chemical structures that are part of the spontaneous possibilities inscribed into the physics and

chemistry of the world in which we live (much in the same manner as the possibilities of the
technical object are inscribed in its material substrate). One can look at the rock and say, it is not alive, and to the cat and say it is at this given time, but there is no way of discerning at

perspective of Stiegler and the atomic and isolated perspective of Kittler th^t open up the clearest perspective on the technological phenomenon possible. Significantly, this is, an analog for Heidegger's later (after the "turn") articulation of the relationship between Being and beings, and potentially a means of understanding the relationship between Being and
techne in a positive light. From here, a way out of the labyrinth of extreme techno-optimism and the dystopic narratives of science fiction may clearer.

1.8 Technological Being/Being Technical:

To question the constitution of the self and of the other is one of the raisons d'etre of science fiction. Although the relationship that is posited between human beings and the other (which

in this literary body is almost always characterized as a kind of technological being) is
frequently viewed in antagonistic/complementary terms, it is arguable that the best of this work vacillates between eliciting sympathy and disdain for both the human and non-human

protagonists. This trope, established by Mary Shelley has been successfully and artfully
exploited in narratives from Star Trek to Blade Runner, and most recently, Battlestar

Galactica (BSG). The discussion of BSG opens up a myriad of questions that may be answered in part through a sustained examination of five central themes that also resonate within the Western tradition. What follows is a detailed examination of the concepts of
memory, monstrosity, metaphor, and medium in order to explicate, critique ana situate each

within both the literary field of science fiction but also within the theoretical axe^ of Kittler

and infertile ground upon which "seed must not be spilled" even as he writes about it. He
privileges the intercourse of dialogue, Socractic maieutics (which are themselves a technique) over the written word precisely because writing represents a kind of hypomnesis (under memory), or prosthetic means of constituting the self.

This attitude is not surprising, since the significance of memory in the constitution of the self is both important to the Greeks and to the human being in general. Although the bardic tradition of Homer and Hesiod was eventually inscribed into words, it springs from an older
pre-literate and oral tradition in which the entire corpus would have been memorized and

recited in order to sustain a cyclical knowledge and understanding of the natural world, of
which human societies were still integrated. Even in Plato's time, writing was relatively new, and his dialogues still reflect this oral tradition in their composition and flow. Husserl shows

us in The Origins of Geometry how the inscription of mathematical axioms and writing in general produces an objective shift in the temporal perception of human beings. It is

precisely writing that provides the objective ground against which linear conceptions of time
become possible. Just as the oral tradition inscribes a cyclical temporality within a chthonic

world order of human immanence, so does the hymomnematic field of writing establish a point of origin from which a linear movement may be traced. History, as a science, is not
possible without writing. Writing and the accumulation of written work produces the

distancing of the human from the divine, and raptures the cyclical nature of our relationship
with physis by divorcing us from the gods. Once myth becomes inscribed, we cannot return

76

to the mythic, except in a historical fashion, because the myths themselves are no longer actuated but part of a historical complex that exists as pre-lapsarian fantasy. The very presence of the medium introduces the hypomnematic fall into every aspect of human life.

Human being is constituted in part by memory, because it is our ability to reconstitute our past that provides an internal temporality that in turn situates us as both mortal and in time. Although we do not know our origins and our endings, we recall the passage of days, and it is this recollection that regulates our ability to perceive and conceive of ourselves as temporal. The history of the individual thus reflects the larger history of the whole, in that the acceleration we feel as we age is a direct result of the relativity of time and our perspectives on the temporal. Disorders of memory produce in the individual remarkable results; the loss of short -term memory, or total amnesia disrupt the temporality of the self, and have subsequent ontological significance in the manner that the individuals both situate and understand themselves as temporal beings. Technologically mediated being is the result of the process whereby memory is transferred from the individual into mnemo-technological devices, which are themselves also media. According to Stiegler, (and Harold Innis and McLuhan), all technologies are media, in that each contains already aspects of its construction and use - information that may be read and understood by another being. Technology and its history is therefore also that of the construction of hypomnematic sytems.

77

The idea that technology and media form a kind of memory complex is not new, and it is

fairly uncontentious. After all, the science of history, and our personal understandings of
ourselves are based in technologically mediated artifacts and processes. The pictures of our

births, of the ancestors who came before us, and the written works that populate the libraries of the earth, both physical and digital exist as a vast repository of supplemental memory. We now have practically constant access to this repository through technology and this serves to

continually constitute and reconstitute our understanding of the self, although this prodess is
S

at once generative and destructive--the source of both our understanding and our suspicions about the nature of human identity as it relates to the technical world. j

In Blade Runner, the crucial ontological paradigm is memory. The technological life forms,
(replicants) require memories to function even though the memories they are given are not

theirs. Without these mnemonic implants, the replicants go rogue and become violent or selfdestructive. Poignantly, each of them carries photographs, digital fantasies of a life that was
never theirs to begin with, hypomnetic devices that allow them to constitute a self. In this

world, memory is necessary for social existence, and without it, the subject collapses inwards on herself. BSG borrows this trope directly, calling its five cylon-human models "skin jobs" (after Blade Runner), and liberally trafficking in the idea of memory as constitutive of the

self. In BSG, the concepts of memory and amnesia, immortality and mortality are played out in both the human and the cylon spheres in order to not only de-stabilize the viewer's sympathies, but to question more deeply the constitution of the human, and of life itself.

Monster: that which shows itself, from itself.

The monster (monstrum--to show) is a figure that weaves its way through this work, afid through the course of Western culture. The monster of antiquity was originally the sign of a divine presence. Ancient gods were often presented as chthonic mixtures of both beast and
human, and mythical and fantastic creatures such as minotaurs and chimera populate an

ancient landscape of oracular potential. This relationship between human and animal, or even
human and vegetable (Osiris and wheat) traces the emergence of transcendental divine beings from the immanent ground of the natural world. The Greek Olympian gods heirald the

approaching limit of the transcendental divine, but even at this stage, the animal is
represented in the god's potential as either a transformative power (Zeus into a swan to court
Leda) or as a stand-in for the god herself (Athena's owl, also present in the offices of the Tyrell corporation, birth site ofBlade Runner's Replicants). This conscious mixing of what are ostensibly two modes of being represents the divine power of the god and the dominion

they possess over both human and natural affairs. The growing split presented is between the human and the natural, a process of differentiation born out of a mediated lifestyle

increasingly urban in naturelxxxH1. By the Hellenistic period, Aristotle is thus able to construct
the divine in a purely transcendental way as "the unmoved mover".

The modern monster draws from its heritage in the sometimes fickle and mixed modalities of early human religious thought. However, in modernity the chimerical blend of animal and

in the subtitle to the work), and thereby the humanity of the species in generallxxxvn. Neither
the old agrarian order of the peasantry or the new mechanical order of science is spared the

Shelley's withering critique. She deftly uses the trope of the monster as a means of criticizing
the Enlightenment project, and to lament the loss of human values that she sees as part of the

social fabric of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The monster is cautionary emblem, not
only that which has passed but more significantly of that yet to come.

Frankenstein's monster is a hybrid mixture of necrotic flesh and of technology, part machine,
part man, made out of the Promethean power of fire (electricity), and he is most significantly born without memory. Although Epimetheus does not figure directly in the novel (he is, as

Stiegler contends, already forgotten), it is an essential forgetting that makes the monster a
brute (Victor, like Epimetheus, has forgotten to give his creation resources, and must rely on

the "theft" of fire). It is the monster's human capacity to learn that makes him, in the end,

more than some menlxxxvin. He, unlike Victor, will learn from his mistakes, and it is this that
causes his ultimate sacrifice at the end of the novel, as he drifts off on an ice flow to be lost in the Arctic. It is assumed by the later film adaptations (most notably those of James Whale) that it is the combined mechanical and human nature of the monster that makes him so horrific, and indeed, after the technological horrors of the Great War (in which Whale was a

soldier), this reading seems more aptlxxxlx. Shelley's intention in the novel however, would
seem to indicate that humanity and monstrosity exist together in all beings as potential, and it

is rather memory (as rational and emotional) that serve to regulate behaviourxc. Of course, the

82

deeper critique proposed by Shelley is that of a tragic Icarian flaw that presents itself as technological hubris and which leads to the downfall of both creator and created.

The technological being presaged by Shelley concretizes the notion of the monstrous as a
blend of human and machine in the literature and film of science fiction hereafter. Every other creation, from the robot Maria in Metropolis, the Replicants in Blade Runner, the Borg

in Star Trek and the Cylons in BSG owe their existence and their ontology to Shelley and her
monster. This work exists in popular culture because it is a reflection of a growing unease that we have with our relationship with technincs. This unease is simultaneously the heritage

of a logocentric bias inherited from Plato and Aristotle, but also of the real process of displacement that the technological medium has been causing in human life, most notably
accelerated since the industrial revolution. Marx and theorists like Lukacs who follow do not fail to point this out: mechanism allows the dismantling of human systems of value and labour and replaces them with fragmented and quantified processes of industry that are

derivative of a reductive mechanical model*01. This is the en-framing that Heidegger is
concerned about in The Question Concerning Technology. In this manner, one may read the cautionary tales of science fiction as a reaction to this ongoing and accelerating process of technologization, one that is frequently constructed as monstrous, and that is embodied in the
technological being (as the site of an absolute ontological horror).

83

This technological monster, which is variously held out as the promise and the peril of humanity is the hybrid cyborg that in many ways we already are. If the literature and film of

science fiction can be said to be about the present at least as much as it is auction of the
future, then the radical dystopic and utopic modes attached to the potential of the technological being betray both a deep concern and fascination with the ongoing engagement
of the West with technology and technics. As Allison Muri demonstrates in The Enlightenment Cyborg, the heritage of the modern human-machine blend descends at least to the Enlightenment. However, the work of Stiegler and Leroi-Gourhan demonstrates that the cybernetic being is always already human. The tool is prosthetic; in that it is placed before us, and in a sense, physically separate. The modern science of prosthetics however is the medical introduction of the technological into the human body. The continuum between the
'L

tool as an extension of a limb and the tool as limb is completed in this cycle, one that has been ongoing since at least Greek times (the shrine of Asklepios at Epidauros contained prosthetics in abundance). The cyborg is in this sense a logical "monstrous" step in a process that is ongoing. In BSG, the imagined fusion is complete: Cylon and human are practically indistinguishable as machine and human mirror one another so perfectly that they reproduce

sexually, and the hybrid Athena is the result (The show's writers present her as mitochondrial
Eve, the mother of all present humanity).

This perfect and seamless blend of machine and human is thus the origin of modern humans,
always already the technical and the organic. This direct insinuation is that which Stiegler is

which any representation of reality becomes possible. Because a representation is always exactly a re-presentation it is always already a metaphor. We are forever caught within, but also potentially liberated from a system of representation by metaphor, which is arguably the engine upon which the symbolic order is founded. In essence, metaphor is the price and the reward of technics, which comprises the linguistic and the social. Communication, as the complex of both the technical and the linguistic, the noetic and the poietic is itself metaphorical. It is in a sense an endless game of telephone in which meaning is broken down
and reconstituted ad infinitum. However, the ontological uncertainty this creates is the ground of potential change, the differentiation and deferral of absolute meaning the very

foundation of ontological possibility. In this sense, the metaphor is also a monster, in that it
shows and hides simultaneously.

John Locke was notably suspicious of the metaphor, as were the positivist philosophers. Locke called the metaphor "mixed mode" and it was this blend that he felt sullied the perfection and the unity of a trope and rendered it unclean and unusable in the pursuit of

knowledgeTM11. He distinguishes the mixed mode from the simple idea, believing that the
latter delineates and defines an actual thing in the world. The word "cat" for instance refers to

an animal, and this presents to him no problem, because a cat is an empirically valid creature
in the world the knowledge of which comes to us through sensory habituation over time. The

fantasy operant in Locke's world is that of unmediated communication made possible by the

avoidance of metaphor. Locke's goal of a "pure and unsullied" philosophical language is

technics, without which we could not even begin to think of such possibility. It is precisely this deferral of meaning by the quasi-transcendental sign that migrates towards, but that

never achieves the transcendental horizon that ensures the very survival of the sign itself.

The sign "A" (as a pyramid, after Derrida) is not simply the Platonic sepulcher of the dead
letter--it is also a time machine which transforms death into life, and reunites the dead king ^

with the sun god (as he is already himself a manifestation of Ra), the finite with the infinite,
and is the symbol of the generative rays of the Egyptian sun/son from which the literal stairway/starway to heaven is built. Out of the shifting sands of the temporal (again the desert of the real) the technique of the letter, like the tomb/time/machine repeats and repositions itself as meaning always in flux. This phonological-graphological differance mirrors the line
between being and non-being that is Leibnizian mathesis universalis: The event horizon

between 0 and 1, the cataclysmic boundary between space and time, the black hole

(singularity) which drives the cosmic engine, a secretive galactic truth which also gels in the
early progenitor of the computer as prime ontological metaphor. In this sense, technics is also

metaphorical, the arche and the telos of what it is to be humanxciv.

Charles Babbage's semi-automatic hardware loom (behind the man Babbage the woman Ada Lovelace Byron who wrote the code upon which it ran) is quite literally, a difference engine
is the material progenitor of the hybrid cybernetic being and those yet to come, the computer

built of both hard and soft, of the digital language and the human producing technological

towards the totalizing effect of the medium in the recent evolution of human beings.

Language is seemingly co-evolved with technics, and the two formed an evolutionary
complex in early human existence, even before the "arrival" of modern H. sapiens. Fine

motor skill receptors, language faculties and musical abilities all center in the same area of

the prefrontal cortex, and are genetically associated with one otherxcvl. This suggests, among
other things that these different human capacities were co-evolved in the same environmental
context, because mutation depends overwhelmingly on selective pressure. Such genetic change is generally understood as the process whereby environmental conditions cause
selective pressures in a given population that in turn drives further selective change. Genetic

drift, random mutation, and possibly viral transcription provide other mechanisms, but it is observably environmental change that produces the vast majority of evolutionary adaptation.

In the human and the proto human, the arrival of tools meant significant alterations in both
resource procurement and use. Not only does tool manufacture demand high-energy output, it

requires extensive forethought (prometheia) and planning. The rewards, however are extensive, and include increased access to richer sources of nutrition and the status they

confer. Technology becomes intertwined with the most basic of human needs--food and
mate acquisition (we know from primatology that a mate with food is a desirable mate). Over millennia, selection would have naturally have begun to "choose" individuals who were ever more competent at the complex duties of tool manufacture, maintenance and use. Inherent in

the complex tool is a morphology that demands fine motor skills and the ability to transfer

remaining media of the first truly mediated age in which the progenitors of modern human beings began a long emergence/emergency from the ground ofphysis. &

The tool then, as a technology, and belonging to the complex of technics is a medium, and in this sense all technology proper belongs to the techno-logical complex that is
communication. The phenomenon of communication can therefore be seen as the unity of beings, and the techno-logical complex that comprises material culture. Ideas, thoughts, memes are inscribed not only in the grey matter of human neurons, but more significantly in our contemporary culture, in the hypomnemata or media that surround us. The mistrust of the medium is precisely the mistrust of the monster, and the monstrosity of the medium is ontological, as Plato rightly argues in the Phaedrus. Writing is at once living and dead, and such it seems immortal. Media transcend their makers in this manner, and the history of

media is therefore the history of the emergence of ever more complex systems of mediation,
from writing to type, to radio and cinema, the television and beyond.

Each progressive technological step produces increasing complexity, both of the medium

itself and of the dynamic systems of communication that surround it. The transducive speed with which these media operate does not cease to accelerate. To be certain, there are periods within the history of media development when setbacks have stalled this progression, but the
last century has witnessed the exponential explosion of global telecommunications system of

unparalleled size and density. If human consciousness can be said to be phenomenally the

out eternally in the cosmos becomes articulated in the series finale as a kind of divine self-

knowingXCVH. The conflict between human polytheism and a monotheism born out of a
mechanical mind breaks down as well, as the divine articulated by mechanical and organic
angels (demons?) alike is revealed to be an Avatar of absolute perfection capable of encompassing all variants, and all beings. This non-dual deva (from the Sanskrit--god) resonates with the later Heidegger's conception of Being. The latent message is that the
titanic struggle between man and machine witnessed in the series is not between the forces of
good and evil, but as Nietzsche would have it, simply beyond both.

The stunning revelation of the series is that our own struggle, and our own misgivings about techno-logical being are at once real and unfounded, because of the always already of the hybrid cybernetic being. Human being, articulated in the social is technical being, and the

collapse of the subject/object relationship, in the death of god and the end of the author is
both the potential death knell of the human and the birth of what is to come--the technological being that is at once irreducibly human and irretrievably other. Of course, this is to engage thoroughly with the fantasy that the human ever truly exists. From the non-dual

c

perspective, that which rather exists is communication, the transference of energy and matter (information) through chemical, organic and mechanical systems from a nebulous past to an equally nebulous future. Seemingly caught like flies in amber, the human subject cannot help

but engage with the existential fiction, as it is the quantitative and qualitative result of a
mortal existence.

parent. Just as Victor Frankenstein and his peers were unable to understand the sad monster
they had built and rejected, so to do fail to understand what we have builtf that which in a
real sense constructs us. This techno-logical progeny is at once protector and executioner of

the human--Oedipus come to kill his father, (just as Ouranos eternally prepares to devour his spawn and Ourobouros eats its own tail). Caught in the endless cycle of death and rebirth, it is easy to see this post-modern mythology as a techno-deterministic fairy tale, but it has a deeper significance, which is to demonstrate a means and a way forward out of the nihilism
of modern consumer culture. Technics, like human children requires care in order to flourish

Communication, as the overarching phenomenon that unites the various theoretical threads of the inquiry is the key to understanding both the teleological and systemic nature of the

development ofphysis with and in contrast to the various elements that compose it. Tracing the history of technology is to trace the history of the medium, and of the slow ascension of the primacy of technics. Most significantly, the invention of the microcomputer and the

establishment of the Internet shortly after the dawn of the electric age inaugurates a new
chapter in this progression. Prior to this epoch, human beings were the primary media through which information passed. That is to say information could not be relayed from one

medium to another without direct human intervention. While the mechanism of the industrial revolution created machines capable of infinite reproduction, (such as the mechanical printing press), these still required human attendants to constantly monitor their supplies and

predetermined level in the home, the thermometer in the thermostat communicates this information with a switch that turns on (controls) the engine in the furnace. The furnace
communicates with the thermometer through heat, and when the temperature rises above another predetermined level, the furnace exerts control on the thermostat, which then shuts off the furnace. It is a very simple example of how communication and control work to

maintain a homeostatic variable, and it is roughly analogous to the systems that scientists

observe in the nature, although these may be infinitely more complex*01*.

The communicative elements of such a system are not complicated, in that we cannot speak of a rich language of exchange. It is a simple mechanical system that serves as a model for much more complicated and significant technological developments. Cybernetics, developed
by Weiner (and exploited by the early geniuses like Alan Turing of the computer revolution)

was one of the significant elements in the development of intricate and complex systems of control and communication that would for the first time, not require any significantiiuman intervention. As these lines are being typed, the various elements of the computer that is processing them are in constant high-level communication, not only with each other, but with

other computers linked together in a vast communications system that is itself in many ways, fully automated. This system is dizzyingly intricate, and self-regulating. While it is tempting to think of it as in the service of humanity, the reality that Kittler exposes is that the technology now serves itself. Stiegler's epiphylogenetic model demonstrates the nearindependence of the system. No one person, or even one group of people can possibly

pieces, as required to human beings, but the element of communicative control is no longer in the hands of the biological human medium, but rather in the technology itself. The fantasy
that we maintain is that by pushing a series of buttons at an automatic teller, or by demanding pornography streaming on the net we are in essence controlling the system, but in fact, it is
the system that is controlling us. We now need the system more than it needs us. The stone

tool required human beings and human culture to propagate itself as a techno-logical
complex. The computer network we have built has no such requirements, and we rather

require it. The shift is in the ontological primacy of the human to the technical medium.

2.0 Conclusion:

The intertwining of the four central concepts--of memory, medium, monster and metaphor

serves not only to illustrate the central postulate of the thesis that Being is itself an interwoven phenomenon, but also the manner in which the communication, as the flow of

information; biological, electrical, genetic, alphanumeric is itself indicative of a larger movement that is arguably Being. The question of time, and in particular mechanical time, which is represented culturally both as an acceleration of the temporal experience, produced

by the relativity of historical experience, through the knowledge of the antiquity of the
historical arche and of the increasing linearity of that same trajectory, individual and collective becomes paramount in determining ontological experience. In modernity, the closing of the helical trajectory of cyclical time and the simultaneous dilation of the

genetic understanding of media and culture in general. The impossibility of definition heralds an end, to be sure, but also a beginning. As with cellular meiosis, the eventual fissioning of the one into two, the accrued memory (as a density of information) that is internal to technology and external to biology in this very particular Steiglerian way is perhaps undergoing the same process. It is a process whereby the monstrous possibility of technical being is announced and assured. Philosophy can therefore be concerned with the emergence
of such a being, which is in a way itself human being becoming, or more simply Being tout
court. The path that remains to be charted is the way in which the divisions in the orders of

Being, from the material through the organic to the mechanical interact, and the precise
manner of these emergencies. In this sense, this work is preliminary, it charts the lines of a

few concepts that help to define this ontology and situate it within a larger body of work. It is
therefore communication that is key because communication studies provides the bridge between logos and techne. It also allows for an understanding of media that transcends materialist or idealist readings, and a renewed understanding of the popular consciousness and the anxiety and dread of the technical that sees these phenomena not as harbingers but rather as potent signs of a future yet to come, paradoxically already here.

This is the promise and the angst that inhabits the world of science fiction, which since
Shelley has heralded the advent of the technological being. The ontological confusion that is

produced by the monstrous medium, the mechanical becoming is produced in the space between the self and the other, and is exacerbated by the ontological difference, which

102

already manifests itself as anxiety. The acceleration of the temporal in the present is the
direct result of transducive speed, as Stiegler points out, and this is not simply technodeterminism, because it is impossible to separate techne from logos. They always already co habit within the realm of the human, and the techno-logical represents the erased arche, the terminus ante quern of the thinking of human being. Culture exists only within the aporia of
the vanishing point of all that is techno-logical. It cannot pierce the veil between itself and

biology, and thus all discussions are forever bound within this closed system of epigenetic
being. To think the hurnan is to think the cultural, just as to think the post-human only ever to think the human. At the other end, the telos, again an infinite horizon, beyond which only the

quantum leap of the mechanical outside the biological may go, the quasi-transcendental limit of differ ance, is the negation of the sign, and of the entire symbolic order, reduced to the
c

difference between zero and one. The teleology this analysis sets up is only deterministic
insofar as systems are self-determining. Systems, both biological and technical combine, in a
non-dual fashion both the rational and the irrational.

The vanishing point at the horizon to which this proposal addresses itself is the emergence of

the technical being. Arguably, this process is already well under way, as the networks of
communication span the globe and tie together vast fields of data and instrumentation,

ostensibly for human need and desire, perhaps themselves nothing more than an orexis

alogos, the "irrational desire" that is human emotion. However, both Stiegler and Kittler have demonstrated how this movement is both externally and internally regulated by forces that

103

are not merely human, cultural or natural, but rather according to an internal logic of the

technical object itself which escapes the boundaries of the human even as it defines it. This
progression from the natural to the cultural to the technical can be read as a movement of the trace of Being, as a kind of ontological flow that transcends the boundaries of what is
traditionally called ontology.

The trajectory announced by Kittler and Stiegler is perhaps the opening of a truly communicative notion of Being, one that is firmly rooted in a renewed and novel look at the place of the technical against and within the sphere of human activity. The conclusions that

may be drawn from this analysis already reveal themselves in the literature and film of
science fiction. This prophetic canon delivers the technical being as possibility--a potential future to which we must both address ourselves and question radically. Heidegger's non-

dualist approach offers a clear path to understanding this progression, one that escapes antagonistic and dialectical readings, and one that potentially offers a means of apprehending the technical in progressively productive terms. It offers the hope that we may acquire not only self-knowledge but also come to know and understand that which we create^to be like ourselves--that which is deserving of the same protean care and respect that sterns so fleetingly hard to attain in the illusory finitude that is human life.

104

I The mathematician Godel is famous for his incompleteness theorem that demonstrates that no system of
mathematics completelyfdescribes any given phenomenon. Conjunctively, thinkers like Slavoj Zizek have noted that philosophical systems are similarly "incomplete". Thus, it is not simply the finitude of the human subject that precludes objectivity but also rather the very nature of the universe itself.

II Techne is translated variously as craft, technology, or art. What is germane to this study is the notion that
techne refers to the man-made, and specifically in this context, to machines and mechanical history, although it
does cover a larger range than what we consider today to be "technological". It is for this reason that Bernard Stiegler uses (in English) the neologism "technics". "There is first of all the problem intrinsic to the object "technics" {la technique), of nc^t falling into a specialized parceled history of techniques; technics is the object

of a history of techniques, beyond technology" (Stiegler,p. 30).

III In his analysis of Aristotle, Heidegger determines that techne is indeed a mode of aletheia. However, it is
secondary because it pertains not to that which is immutable, but that which can be otherwise. "In techne the

know-how is directed to the ppeiton, toward what is first produced and hence is not yet. This implies that the
object can also be otherwise..." (Heidegger 2003, p. 28).

lv "We can come to understand it only on the basis of the meaning of the Greek concept of Being. Because
precisely that to which sophia, is related is everlasting, and because sophia is the purest way of comportment to,
and of tarrying with, the everlasting, therefore sophia as a genuine positionality toward this highest mode of

Being, is the highest possibility" (Heidegger 2003, p. 117).

v "Nature and history become the objects of a representing that explains. Such representing counts on nature and
takes account of history. Only that which becomes object in this way is--is considered to be in being. We first
arrive at science as research when the Being of whatever is, is sought in such an objectiveness" (Heidegger, p. 127).

"This is why the instrumental conception of technology conditions every attempt to bring man into the right relation to technology. Everything depends on our manipulating technology in the proper manner as a means"

(Heidegger, p. 289). L V1 This does not discount that there are not more destructive and less destructive ways of living in nature, nor

that the modern expression of objectification is totalizing, rather it is to suggest that one should not confuse a historically prior and less destructive period of civilization with a mythical Mud tempus in which human beings lived in harmony with nature. Human beings, as Homo sapiens are already mediated and technical beings by

virtue of our ubiquitous use of tools, a practise that transcends our genus, and traces itself into antiquity through
Homo habilis to Australopithecus, a phylogeny that is ancient by more than a million years.

v" Linear time is in the simplest sense, measured time. Although agriculture is based on seasonal cycles, even
this temporal progression acquires a linear trajectory not evident in hunter-gatherer conceptions.

vl" Mircea Eliade develops this thesis (with respect to sacrifice) in The Myth ofEternal Return: "A sacrifice, for
example not only exactly reproduces the initial sacrifice revealed by a god ab origine, at the beginning of time,

it also takes place at the same primordial mythical moment; in other words, every sacrifice repeats the intial sacrifice and coincides with it" (Eliade, 1971, p. 35).

lx Oral/aural cultures rely on the regeneration of myth and of culture through story telling. Origin is therefore
always imbued in cultural practice and experience. Written/ocular cultures maintain the origin as a fixed point in a distant past precisely because writing ensures its own antiquity. The medium becomes a temporal mode through which a culturally linear trajectory becomes possible.

x Heidegger's magnum opus Being and Time deals with the relationship explicitly, as does Stiegler's Technics
and Time. Henri Bergson's Time and Free Will also deals with temporality, memory and perception.

X1 Briefly, Einstein's general relativity states that the passage of time is not universally uniform, but rather relative to the proximity of the subject to a center of mass. In the milky way, for example the perception of the
passage of time on earth is not the same as at the galactic hub, because the gravitational pull of the massive black holes that are situated there cause time to slow to an almost stand-still (at the event horizon of the
singularity).

105

xn "Every explication and every transition.. .is nothing other than historical disclosure.. .this is to say that the
whole of the cultural present, understood as a totality 'implies' the whole of a cultural past in an undetermined
but structurally determined generality. To put it more precisely, it implies continuity of pasts which imply one another...and this whole continuity is a unity of traditionalization up to the present...we can also say now that history is from the start nothing other than the vital movement of the coexistence and the interweaving of
original formations and sedimentations of meaning" (Husserl, p. 173).

xm Differance is notoriously difficult to relate and explain. Jacques Derrida explicitly states that it isn't even a
concept. He wants us to think of it in terms of a conditional or as a potential: "It is rather because there is no
name for it at all, not even in the name of essence or of Being, not even that of "differance" which is not a

name, which is not a pure nominal unity, and unceasingly dislocates itself in a chain of differing and deferring substitutions" (Derrida, 1982 p. 26).

xlv Philosophy and religious thought in antiquity "permit" the transcendental god. The movement of the divine
from a purely immanent to a purely transcendental position is paradoxically that which allows Nietzsche to announce the death of god. It is only possible to kill the divine once it no longer inhabits the natural and human worlds, as the chthonic gods perpetually cycle through life and death.

xv "This mythical time is "sacred" because it was sanctified by the real presence and the activity of Supernatural
Beings. But like all other species "of sacred time", although infinitely remote, it is not inaccessible. It can be
reactualized through ritual. Moreover, it constitutes a kind of charter of things that still happen, and a kind of logos, or order transcending everything significant for aboriginal man" (Eliade, 1973, p. 43). ^

XV1 Human being is constructed out of both memory and experience. Temporality and mortality arise as
conditions of both. Time only has a vector if the subject can remember a time before now. Thus, a purely
immanent temporality in which the subject experiences only the moment lived cannot produce either knowledge

or a fear of death. The subject will respond not reflexively, but instinctually. It is this emergence out of
instinctual existence that marks the "birth" of the human--a birth that is simultaneously a death of innocence (albeit one that is necessarily fantastical because it necessarily predates memory, and therefore origin). Origin
implies some sense of linear temporality.

xv" Species are, in a very fundamental manner, epiphenomenal expressions of genes, which are themselves
nothing more than assemblies of atoms that in turn are representations of theoretical sub-atomic manifestations of space-time itself. Individual consciousness is the phenomenon that produces the discrete nature of the lifeworld, but even that is constituted in an inter-subjective manner. Thinkers from Aristotle to Merleau-Ponty have

remarked upon this, and it is not so strange as it might first appear to think, quite contrarily that cogito ergo sum non, is rather also the case, given that the "I" referred to here is the singular and rational subject as res cogitans.

That thinking does not define the self, but rather something more expansive, the realm of though or the noosphere (after Teilhard, Bergson, and Verdansky) is an idea that opposes itself to Cartesian dualism and that
opens up the possibility of a way forward out of the crisis of Rationality. xvm "Already we have j^ t0 delineate that differance is not, does not exist, is not a present-being (on) in any

form; and we will be lead to delineate also everything that it is not, that is, everything; and consequently, that it
has neither existence nor essence" (Derrida, 1982, p. 6). "\

xlx The separation of the word "archaeology" by the hyphen is meant to draw attention to the relationship
between telos and arche (end and beginning) and the scientific study of antiquity, which is quite literally a speaking about origins. It also highlights the significance of the study of the material remains of culture, and of techne in general to the overall discussion.

xx Aristotle's Categories divides primary substance into form (hyle) and matter (morphos). Hylomorphism is a
significant dualism in the history of philosophy, and may be seen as an important theoretical foundation of
Cartesian mind/body dualism (which is itself a reworking and expansion of an Augustinian aphorism).

XX1 It is arguable that language or speech carries writing within it already as a precondition. Sign language and
body language, gesture (to borrow from Andre Leroi-Gourhan) makes up part of the integral dynamics of speaking from the very start. If the sounds themselves can be thought of as a kind of negative space within the

106

mouth, then it is the positive physicality of the tongue, jaw and palate that make up the techne of speech. We are

not accustomed to thinking of the body as a tool, but it is always already the first tool that any animal possesses.
The differentiation between the body and the external artifact is not necessary for the determination of the tool
itself--speaking and making are already bound to each other in the horizon of embodied experience.

xxu Nous generally refers to 'mind', mdpoiein to 'making'. What is proposed here is a reading of the
relationship between the world of thought and the world of the made object in which the 'thinking' does not
reside solely in the human being. Rather, the system of objects, or artifacts that make up the external world participate in a real and concrete fashibn in the shaping of the mental landscape, which is not subjectively bound, but inter-subjectively constituted. Moreover, the technological object, and in particular, 'hot' (McLuhan)

communications media play a significant and important role in that inter-subjective constitution of the self.
Thus, poiesis is the expressive and generative aspect of noesis, and the two should not be considered
independently of one another, but rather always in tandem.

xxm Aleitheia literally means 'truth', but it is rooted in an archaic term for 'covered'. The Greek understanding of
truth is as a negative concept, because to speak the truth is to engage in 'uncovering' or a-leuthein. "This privative expression indicates that the Greeks had some understanding of the fact that the uncoveredness of the world must be wrested, that it is initially and for the most part, not available" (Heidegger, 1997, p. 11).

XX1V Techne may be translated in a variety of ways. I borrow the rather general translation 'craft', because in its
most general sense, the word simply refers to any man-made object. Bernard Stiegler advances this view in Technics and Time: The Fault ofEpimetheus. In particular, he refers to the myth of Prometheus that is outlined
in Plato's Protagoras, in which Prometheus must steal from Hephaestus and Athena the 'arts' and fire in order to correct the oversight of Epimetheus. The arts that are here being referred to are the technical arts, as it is Zeus that eventually confers wisdom (sophid) and political skill (sophisthes) on humanity. In this manner, Stiegler sees techne as the foundation for all other human skills. Logos is generally translated as speech. "Thus, aletheuthein (uncovering, revealing) shows itself most
immediately in legein ("to speak") is what most basically constitutes human Dasein. In speaking, Dasein

expresses itself~by speaking about something, about the world. This legein was for the Greeks so preponderant

and such an everyday affair that they acquired their definition of man in relation to and on the basis of, this
phenomenon and thereby determined man as zoon logon echon" (Heidgger, 1997, p. 19). This formulation and exposition also exposes the logocentric bias that exists in the Western metaphysical tradition.

xxv The relationship of logos and techne to nous is complex. They are here used to refer primarily to the
expressive, and concrete presence of both language and craft in the world, and not as much to their mental, or

ideal existence. However, both logos and techne may be reconciled through poiesis, which functions here as the outer expression of nous.

xxvl Wittgenstein's articulation of his concept of a language game in the Philosophical Investigations is
developed maieutically over a relatively large body of axiomatic and inter-connected statements. With respect to the problem of definition, Wittgenstein asserts that language expresses meaning effectively because the participants in a given 'language,game' understand each other clearly. Thus, when someone is told to put an object roughly there, that person understands, based upon the given rules which govern that particular game, where to put the object. The number of rules pertinent to any given game may be more or less, and it isn't necessary, according to Wittgenstein, to understand them all. Rather, what is necessary is that the participants understand enough rules to be competent players. PI § 71. xxvii «jjow t0 conceive wnat is outside a text? That which is more or less than a text's own, proper margin? For example, what is other than the text of Western metaphysics? It is certain that the trace which "quickly vanishes

in the destiny of Being (and) which unfolds ... as Western metaphysics" escapes every determination, every name it might receive in the metaphysical text. It is sheltered, and therefore dissimulated, in these names. It does not appear in them as the trace "itself." (Derrida, 1982, p. 22).

xxvm "Thereby the text of metaphysics is comprehended, still legible; and to be read. It is not surrounded but
rather traversed by its limit, marked in its interior by the multiple furrow of its margin. Proposing all at once the

107

monument and the mirage of the trace, the trace simultaneously traced and erased, simultaneously living and dead, and, as always, living in its simulation of life's preserved inscription. A pyramid. Not % stone fence to be jumped over but itself stonelike, on a wall, to be deciphered otherwise, a text without voice" (Derrida, 1982, p.

24). xxlx Non-dualism demands inclusion. Although this is a totalizing grand narrative, it is also simultaneously a
narrative made of many disparate threads. An appropriate metaphor would be of a weaving. Many different threads of varying shapes, textures, fibers and sizes can nonetheless be woven into a coherent and functional piece of fabric, because this is the qualitative nature of both the process of weaving and of thread. Philosophical threads can be woven in the same fashion as long as one accepts that they need not agree in order to be combined in this fashion. What must be kept in mind is that ways of seeing contribute to the overall understanding of the picture. None can describe its totality, either in isolation or in combination, but nonetheless a complete picture emerges. Just as a weaving is composed of negative space, so are there points of non-contact between philosophical perspectives. Non-dualism potentially allows the combination of threads otherwise seen
as fatally paradoxical.

xxx Zizek uses the term parallax to describe aporetic phenomena, and requires both an ontological shift in the
object in question and an epistemological shift in the observer, or subject. Heidegger is (in part) concerned with the ontological difference between Being and beings. The essential problem that presents itself relates to the question of the transcendental nature of Being and the relation of finite being to it. Again, it is the opposition of the terms that creates, in a very real sense, the tension of Western thought, and the problems of determination, and definition. It is precisely this tension that opens up and inaugurates the temporal acceleration of the process
of differance itself.

xxxl "For Heidegger what self-shows, and the self showing as such (the emergent emerging), includes what
humans bring to and what they 'receive' in, the phenomenon. Thus, in Heidegger's phenomenology from Sein undSeit on the subject-object distinction collapses (Maly, pp. 3-4). xxxn uWe cannot just Abandon' the ontological difference, because it is a part and parcel of the historical unfolding of be-ing in its shape as metaphysics. But to be let into the dynamic of be-ing as en-owning, we must ieap over' the distinction. But this paradox also belongs to the necessity of thinking, which Heidegger's sayingthinking wants to open up" (Maly, p. 29).

xxxm £)f^rance according to Derrida is a way of thinking about human existence that shows how any

determination is both a differentiation and deferral. To think the human is always to differentiate, to exclude. This exclusion is never final, but always a process whereby an ultimate differentiation or definition is put off infinitely. The horizon to which this process directs itself, its end or telos is necessarily quasi-transcendental (Derrida's notion), because we move towards it, but never achieve it. This is the nature of finite existence, and in this sense, differance becomes a way of non/thinking about Being itself. Derrida is careful, however to try to demonstrate how differance is as much or more about a non-speaking or a non-thing, xxxiv ujn omer words? could we not say that we find ourselves in Heidegger the monient we fully assume and think to the end that there is no transhistorical absolute knowledge, that every morality that we adopt is provisory! Is not Heidegger's hermeneutics of historical being a kind ofontology ofprovisory existence? This is why the topic of finitude is inextricably linked to that of failure" (Zizek, p. 274).

xxxv "Perhaps this is why the Heraclitean play of the hen diapheron heautoi, of thfe one differing from itself, the
one in difference with itself, already is lost like a trace in the determination of the diapherein as ontological
difference"(Derrida, p. 22).

Another of Heraclitus' fragment in its entirety points us in a slightly different direction. "They do not understand that what differs agrees with itself; it is a back-stretched connection such as the bow or the lyre" (Hippolytus, Refutations). Kittler speaks of Odysseus' bow as a kind of lyre, and Stiegler draws connections between speech and music. The intellectual bond between music, math, gesture and speech is borne out in scientific studies that demonstrate the association of fine motor skills, musical ability and mathematics in the human brain. "Our study has shown reciprocal effects of musical and linguistic tasks on the excitability of the

xhu Harold Innis speaks of a 'bias of communication' that shapes the course of a civilization. Manfred Schneider
takes this up with respect to both the medium and the message, building on the work of Innis and McLuhan,
showing (among other things), how the advent of printing combined with Luther's Protestantism set in motion the democratization of Western Europe. "This is a decisive economic aspect: ritual, liturgy, and the participation

of human beings in these differentiated ceremonies secured the stability and the equality of sacramental

1x111 Shelley's narrative construction leaves a little to be desired, as she doesn't fully grasp the operations of
language and the development of memory in the individual. She also significantly reduces the time it would
take to acquire all of the perceptive and linguistic skills of an adult, but this is necessarily required for the

narrative to move forward. Thus, the monster says "It is with great difficulty that I remember the original era of my being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct. A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt at the same time; and it was indeed, a long time before I
distinguished between the operations of my various senses".

lxiv This reflects Oshii's strong sense that there is another, deeper reality, a sort of Platonic numinal realm,
underlying the surface world of objects. This sensibility is represented visually through Oshii's frequent use of
shadows, of oscillating bursts of light emerging from behind objects, and of images of the world reflected in mirrors, windows, and, especially, bodies of water. The protagonist of Oshii's most famous film, Ghost in the
Shell, quotes 1 Corinthians 13:11, "For now we see as through a glass darkly, but then we shall see face to

face", and this passage could be taken as an epigram for Oshii's overall aesthetic project. Indeed, one of the
main functions of Oshii's work is to draw attention to the limitations of human vision and bring the viewer to a point where he/she can recognise the abstract, possibly transcendental, world underlying the seemingly solid

object-oriented one we inhabit. The deeply introspective protagonists of his films can only partially intuit this
"deeper" world, but they do experience moments of private revelation in which they see themselves reflected on another surface and seem shocked by their own image.

lxv" There is a series of scenes in the last season in which the problematic antagonist Gaius Baltar (the betrayer

embrace those cast out by society (Mary Magdalene the prostitute).

lxvm j^q Cyions possess what they call resurrection ships. This technology allows them to download the
consciousness of any of the separate models at death and put them into new bodies or the collective

consciousness. Civil war among the cyions and military action by the colonial fleet eventually destroys these ships, essentially making the cyions mortal again. They do not possess the technology (which was developed by
the five unique models), and the five are not willing to give it to them (an element of the civil discord).

lxix Peter Sloterdijk has articulated hybridity as the condition of the collapse of metaphysics. "The fundamental
differentiation (in the metaphysical period) of soul and thing, spirit ^nd matter, subject and object, freedom and

technique cannot cope with entities that are by their very constitution hybrids with a spiritual and material "component". Cybernetics, as the theory and practice of intelligent machines, and modern biology, as the study

of system-environment-units, have forced the questions of the old metaphysical divisions to be posed anew"

lxxiv Pythagoras and his followers were dismayed to discover that in the universe of order there was an entire
edifice of disorder. While some right angle triangles produce rational measures of the hypotenuse, others give

physical universe.

divulged that the syllable GRA stands at the beginning of the word GRAMMA--in plain English, the letter.

Starting with the literal element (stocheion), but scrupulously avoiding the older word in order to arrive at a
meaning or logos, the definition has come full circle. Hence media studies is free to forget the whole 'hylomorphism' that from Aristotle to McLuhan suppressed letters, syllables and words (Kittler, p. 55).

power and a renunciation of knowledge. It is in the inheritance of the conflict--in whicli the philosophical episteme is pitched against the sophistic tekhne whereby all technical knowledge is devalued--that the essence of technical entities in general is concealed" (Stiegler, p. 1).

The connection between the stars (energeia) in ge-Stell and the organic is made in the apparatus, the mechanical.

It is rather because there is no name for it at all, not even the name of essence or of Being, not even that of "differance", which is not a name, which is not a pure nominal unity, and unceasingly dislocates itself in a chain of differing and

experiments by Lavoisier were certainly widespread by Shelley's time. In this sense, Victor is "stealing fire" in order to re-create the human order; Like Prometheus, he will be punished for his folly. The hideousness of his creation in many ways mirrors the decrepitude in his own soul, and this is Shelley's overall point---the monster

"shows" Victor to be himself monstrous, because he reaches for what he does not have the right to attain. "I
collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at

nearly burnt out" (Shelley, p. 55).

kxxvm r^ en(j of the tale is primarily devoted to the monster's speech, in which he articulates his own horror at

the errors of his ways, and most tellingly, takes responsibility for them, even though he was given no direction,
guidance or care from his creator, Victor. "Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings, who pardoning my

outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was nourished by high thoughts of honour and devotion. No guilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery can be found comparable
to mine. When I run over the frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendental visions of the beauty and majesty of goodness" (Shelley, p.213).

kxxix gjjj £;onc[on's semi-fictional screen adaptation of Christopher Bram's Gods and Monsters explores the
intertextual subtleties between the original novel and the life of the filmmaker Whale, who as an openly gay man in Hollywood during the 1930's embodied some of the major Promethean tragedies that are woven into the
story.

xc This is the point that is made by Fritz Lang and Thea Von Harbou in Metropolis the foundational film of the
science fiction genre. Maria strives to inculcate in the workers and in the city dwellers the idea that love's

knowledge (the knowledge of the heart) is necessary for a truly balanced humanity. Implicit in the critique is
that pure rationality produces, (after Goya's El Sueno de la Razon Produce Monstruos) monsters.

XC1 "If we follow the path taken by labour in its development from the handicraft via the cooperation and
manufacture to machine industry we can see a continuous trend towards greater rationalization, the progressive
elimination of the qualitative, human and individual attributes of the worker" (Lukacs, p.88).

xcu Steigler articulates the epiphylogenesis of technology both within and against the notion of the trace of Being. While Derrida speaks of the trace in doubly negative terms (as a non-concept itself negated) in order to "push" the concept outside of the boundaries of traditional philosophy, Steigler takes up this "thread" and
demonstrates the fashion in which this general movement is echoed in technological development. xcni "What has been said here of mixed modes is with very little difference applicable also to relations; which,
since every man himself may observe... I allow, it might be brought into a narrower compass: but I was willing to stay my reader on an argument that appears to me new, and a little out of the way.. .that by searching it to the bottom, and turning it on every side, some part or other might meet with every one's thoughts, and give occasion to the most averse or negligent to reflect on a general miscarriage; which, though of great consequence, is little taken notice of... because the faults men are usually guilty of in this kind are not only the greatest hinderances

of true knowledge, but are so well thought of as to pass for it... if, by any enlargement on this subject, I can make men reflect on their own use of language; and give them reason to suspect... it may also be possible for them to have sometimes very good and approved words in their mouths and writings, with very uncertain, little,
or no signification"(Locke, p. 41).

XC1V This paragraph is a kind of lexical fugue in which the opening shots of Difference are placed in
counterpoint with Kittler's observations in Colors and/or Thinking Machines. Although the content originates in

their work, the expansion of these themes draws them together and explicates what has been left unsaid in the
source material.

xcv "Metaphor is one of our most important tools for trying to comprehend partially what cannot be
comprehended totally: our feelings, aesthetic experiences, moral practices, and spiritual awareness. These

endeavors of the imagination are not devoid of rationality; since they use metaphor, they employ an imaginative
rationality"(Lakoff, Johnson, p. 114).

xcvi "rpj^s SUggests that the right hemispheric system for music processing has homolog functional connections

js a gyjjj^j of infinity, in which a simple twist produces an infinite two-dimensional plane. It is

thus possible to draw one set of figures that seem to be on one side of the loop and another that seem to be on the other, demonstrating in this metaphorical case that human and machine are of one and the same arc in spacetime.

xcvm While such things are common today, the heritage of these devices is ancient. Heron of Alexandria most
notably invented a system of steam ducts that would open and close temple doors when a fire was lit on an altar. Although there is lively debate about whether Heron's designs were eyer built, his mechanical genius demonstrates the antiquity of proto-cybernetic mechanics.

XC1X The carbon cycle is a prime example of this. The biosphere regulates the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere
through a variety of biological mechanisms that are still poorly understood. The same is true of the oxygen cycle, which is more clearly understood due to the nature of the gas. It is extremely reactive and volatile, which is what makes it an excellent combustible, and extremely useful to high-energy organisms (aerobic) such as ourselves. However, because it is so highly reactive, atmospheric oxygen should have been depleted eons ago. Plant life maintains global 02 levels by constantly cycling in C02 during the day and expulsing G2 at night. If the O2 levels drop too low (below about 13%), all aerobic life would die. If they were to rise much above 17%, the result would be that fires would start by themselves, and would not go out under any circumstance. Life, in this sense is engaged in planetary self-regulation and is a homeostatic, cybernetic system.

XC1X Writing, cell phones, digital assistants, video, and film--all these contribute to the movement of the human
being into the technical world. In a sense, they strip the user of her authority, because we come to rely on them to interpret and understand each other, frequently remotely. Paradoxically, they also bring us closer together over great spatio-temporal distances, even as the system of communications technology, media assumes its own
ontology.
