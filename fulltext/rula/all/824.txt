Abstract
This thesis presents a fuzzy control method for a vibratory grain dryer. The proposed control method maintains the resonant condition for a dynamical system having constant linear stiffness, variable mass and variable damping coefficient. The MATLAB simulation results have confirmed that the fuzzy control method based on amplitude measurement is reliable and efficient. An experimental setup has also been developed to implement the proposed control method. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the fuzzy control method.

1.1 Introduction

INTRODUCTION

The purpose of introducing vibration to a drying bed and maintaining it at a significant level is to fluidize the grains in the drying chamber, and to promote the heat transfer between the grains and the hot air blown into the drying chamber. Vibration-induced fluidization may improve the drying efficiency of a manually controlled resonant vibration drier two fold [1]. To fluidize the grains and enhance drying efficiency, the peak vertical acceleration of the vibrating bed should be significantly larger than the gravitational acceleration while the displacement amplitude is maximized. To achieve the required level of acceleration and displacement amplitUde for fluidization, the concept of resonance is utilized. At resonance, the vibration amplitude peaks. This, coupled with the excitation frequency (or motor speed), produces a desired value of acceleration.

1.1.1 Plant and Modeling
The plant under control is a vibratory grain dryer, shown in Fig. 1.1. The plant consists of a container with Lucite walls and perforated pegboard base, attached to the base plate. The motor is coupled to the Lucite container through angles. The vibration is produced by the two eccentric weights, mounted on two gears rotating at the same speed but in opposite directions. The eccentricity of the two counter rotating weights is equal. This causes only a vertical force to be transmitted to the pegboard. Furthermore, the bed is constrained to move in the vertical direction by guide rails.

1.1.2 Problem Statement

The resonance amplitude is a function of stiffness, damping coefficient, drying system mass, excitation frequency and excitation aml?litude. The natural frequency depends on the system mass and stiffness. The system mass depends on the initial state of syste.m and time (due to drying). For a given initial amount of wet grains, the equivalent mass added to the system from the grains is different for different types and moisture content of the grains. The

2

equivalent mass is a function of the grain size, geometry and moisture. Damping in the system is a combination of damping from the springs, and losses due to friction. The damping

coefficient is also different at different times for a given grain type. The drying system is complex for an exact analysis. Thus, it is beneficial to develop an intelligent control to run the system at the optimized motor speed. In this work, a fuzzy control method is developed to automatically run the drying system at resonance. Computer simulations and experiments are conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

1.2 Motivation for Intelligent Fuzzy Control
\ Conventional control techniques such as Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) control have many advantages. When values of controller parameters are known, control signals are generated exactly. If a process can be modeled mathematically, many of these techniques may provide good stability, robustness and speed of response. However, there are several disadvantages associated with the conventional control methods. The control algorithms are "hard" or "inflexible", and cannot generally handle "soft" or "flexible" intelligent control. The ever-increasing technological demands call for complex systems to achieve high perfonnance. Some complex systems cannot be controlled in a conventional manner because of vague knowledge of a process. Acquisition of adequate system knowledge is often

problematic due to system complexity, variable parameters, load uncertainty, etc. To control complex systems, intelligent control techniques are often used. The area of intelligent control is a fusion of many research areas. Generally, intelligent control involves learning, reasoning and inference, making use of incomplete, vague, non-crisp and qualitative information, past experience and knowledge. Intelligent control systems are

able to perfonn one or more of the following functions: planning actions at different levels; learning from past experience, identifying failures that threaten system behaviors and reacting appropriately, etc. These functions define the areas of planning and expert systems, fuzzy systems, neural networks, machine learning, and failure diagnosis [2]. Fuzzy logic control is a subset of intelligent control. The main feature of fuzzy control is that a control knowledge base is available within the controller; the control actions are generated by applying existing conditions or data to the knowledge base, making use of an inference mechanism. The knowledge base and the inference mechanism can process non-crisp and incomplete infonnation. The main idea behind fuzzy control is to model an expert operator, who is able to control the process, instead of using a mathematical fonnalization of the process. Fuzzy control has been successfully used in areas where workable mathematical models for plants are very difficult or impossible to derive. There is a simpie language difference between fuzzy and conventional control. Ordinary differential equations are the language of conventional control while rules are the language of fuzzy control.

1.3 Literature Review
A few successful applications of fuzzy control are reviewed. Due to long time delay and other nonlinear factors associated with the plant and drying process, use of classical feedback controllers will encounter difficulties in controlling the grain dryers [3]. It is difficult to model the interactions between the grains and the bed. Fuzzy control has been successfully used for implementing human reasoning and does not rely on a precise system dynamic model. Experienced operator knowledge can be represented in terms of fuzzy qualitative variables. In fact, it gives the most efficient knowledge representation method for rule-based systems dealing with continuous variables [4]. A fuzzy controller is able to deal with significant 4

variations in the input fields [5]. A hybrid fuzzy PIO controller is used to maintain the output product moisture at a required level for a nonlinear, time variant and significant time lag industrial steam heated dryer [6]. A fuzzy logic controller provides a highly efficient solution for a multi-variable control problem. Fuzzy logic can be used to design supervisory controllers from operator experience and experimental results [7]. In crane control, the sway must be reduced to almost zero for load release. Fuzzy control was successfully designed, based on operator experience, and tested for the anti-sway control of cranes [8]. Fuzzy control, in

comparison with a conventional controller, has faster response time and significantly smaller overshoot [9]. A fuzzy-PIO controller, for a nonlinear and time variant naphtha hydrodesulfurizing petrochemical plant, was able to control top temperature, for both steady and transient system states [10]. A fuzzy controller and a proportional-plus-derivative controller are used for controlling a servo motor, flexible arm and a system with three vibration modes. The system response shows that the fuzzy controller not only has all the functions of a proportional-plus-derivative controller but also performed better than the proportional-plusderivative controller when nonlinearities and uncertainties are introduced [11]. Fuzzy control of a waste incineration plant is investigated in [12, 13], and digging track of an experimental excavator is investigated in [14]. There are other applications where fuzzy control has been effectively used. Even if a controller can be designed using the conventional analytical theory, a designer may still prefer to use the non-analytical approach because (i) a fuzzy controller is easy to design; (ii) it may be easy to implement in hardware; and (iii) it may result in a more robust controller (A robust controller is less susceptible to system parameter changes or to noise.) [15]. Knowledge about a dynamic system that definitely cannot be expressed in any mathematical way may be

expressed in rule bases. Fuzzy logic provides the best technique for knowledge representation that could be devised for encoding knowledge about continuous variables [16]. The ease with which a priori linguistically expressed information may be incorporated into a fuzzy system, gives the approach a potential advantage concerning the use of additional cost functions in the adaptive process [17]. Because of the lack of mathematical models, the stability of a fuzzy system can only be described qualitatively without quantitative indices [18, 19]. Comparisons among different control methods are given in Table 1.1, the principal contributions of fuzzy systems, neural networks, and genetic algorithms are complementary rather than competitive [20].

The formulation of fuzzy models consists of three basic sub-problems: structure identification (input variables, membership functions and fuzzy rules), parameter estimation (determination of unknown parameters), and model validation (testing) [21]. From its conception to present state, fuzzy research has advanced towards more intelJigent systems. Development of fuzzy systems started with manual tuning of system parameters based on observing the system performance. In the 1980's, Takagi and Sugeno developed an algorithm

for constructing fuzzy rules using training data [22]. Development of both neural networks and fuzzy logic in the 1980's gave impetus to the use of neural network learning techniques for identifying parameters in a fuzzy system [23]. In the 1990's, optimization of fuzzy system parameters was done using genetic algorithms [24]. Currently, researchers are working on a new generation of intelligent systems or hybrid systems, using genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic and other artificial intelligence techniques [25, 26]. NEFGEN (Neuro Fuzzy Generator), ANFIS (Adaptive-Network-based Fuzzy Inference Systems), NEFCON (Neuro-Fuzzy Control), NEFCLASS (Neuro-Fuzzy Classification) and NEFPROX (Neuro-Fuzzy Function Approximation) and other hybrid NF (Neuro-Fuzzy) adaptive network models are successfully tested [27]. These models differ in the way that learning is carried out, the kind of knowledge to be extracted and the nature of parameters of the derived fuzzy systems.

1.4 Contributions
There are three major contributions of this thesis work: . 1. A fuzzy controller is developed; . 2. The proposed fuzzy controller is successfully simulated using Matlab; and 3. Hardware instrumentation was implemented and tested successfully.

1.5 Organization of Thesis
In Chapter 2, redesigning of the drying system is discussed and then analysis is performed to measure mechanical properties and to -formulate vibration equations. The system was redesigned for proper operations of a vibratory grain dryer. Details are given in Appendix A. Experiments were performed to determine the center of gravity and moment of inertia. Details

are given in Appendix B. The Lagrange method was used for establishing vibration equations for the empty system with three degrees of freedom (details are given in Appendix C). The steps for the fuzzy controller design are discussed in Chapter 3. Initial steps of a fuzzy logic controller involved choosing inputs and outputs, assigning membership function for the inputs and outputs, and forming fuzzy rules. Fuzzy rules represent partially the operating knowledge and system behavior. Simulations of the proposed fuzzy controller are done using Matlab. Chapter 4 is divided into two parts. The first part discusses hardware instrumentation and programming details. The second part discusses the result of experiments conducted for the empty and loaded system under various conditions of grains and their types. Chapter 5 concludes the thesis and discusses future work.

MECHANICAL MODIFICATION AND VIBRATION ANALYSIS

2.1

Introduction
To fluidize grains and enhance drying efficiency of a vibration dryer, the effective bed

acceleration in the vertical direction should be significantly (actual value depends on the amount and state of grains) larger than the gravitational acceleration (g). At resonance, for a . single degree of freedom system with damping, local maximum acceleration and global maximum displacement amplitude take place simultaneously.

2.2 Mechanical Modification
The system response is dependent on the motor speed, which in tum depends on the control voltage (0-8.25 volts) being supplied to the motor drive. It was visually confirmed that the original system amplitude does not increase with the increasing control voltage beyond the maximum value. Theoretically, at lower or higher frequencies, displacement amplitude is lower than the resonant displacement amplitude. A Visual Designer program was written to study the system response over the complete frequency range; details of the program are given in Appendix A. The motor frequency could not increased beyond 22 Hz (1320 r.p.m), as the motor drive goes into a saturation state. At 22 Hz, the motor withdraws 90 volts and 0.5 Ampere from the motor drive before machine modification. The machine was modified as shown in Fig. 2.1 with a detailed description given in Appendix A. The motor can reach 1800 r.p.m rotational speed after the modification of the machine.

calculating moment of inertia and to measure distances between C.O. and line of force. Experiments were performed to determine the e.O. and moment of inertia. Details are given in Appendix B. The moment of inertia and the distances are used to formulate Lagrange equations. Initially, vibration analysis was done for a three degree-of-freedom analysis as given in Appendix C.

In general, the effective interactive force between the bed and grains is dependent on a number of factors such as the motion of the bed, the average grain size, the moisture, the degree of fluidization, etc. It is extremely difficult to develop a reliable mathematical model for the interactive force. Even if empirical model may be devised,.it is deemed to be a complex one for which an analytical solution cannot be easily obtained. It is difficult to apply

conventional control methods. This is why fuzzy control is highly desirable and used in this thesis. A steady state solution to Eqn. (2.2) may be easily obtained for the no-load situation. It is written as

3.1 Introduction

FUZZY CONTROL DESIGN

For efficient heat transfer, the grain surface area in contact with the hot air should be maximized at all times. Thus, the instantaneous bed acceleration should be greater than the gravitational acceleration for a significant portion of time during one cycle to achieve the fluidization effect. Since the peak acceleration of the system is designed to be well above the gravitational acceleration for the plant, the objective of the controller is to achieve and maintain the resonant condition in order to optimize the energy use and drying time. A loaded system natural frequency tends to be lower than the empty bed natural frequency. The loaded system natural frequency increases as grains are being dried with time. At startup, the operating frequency is set to be slightly greater than the natural frequency of the empty system. Subsequently, the fuzzy logic determines the first voltage change according to the set initial values of voltage change and normalized amplitude change, i.e., amplitude change normalized with respect to the current maximum amplitude. After the startup, the fuzzy logic determines the required voltage change according to the real measurements of voltage change and the corresponding normalized amplitude change. The Visual Designer program is written and used for data acquisition, processing and control. The fuzzy logic toolbox of the Matlab is used for fuzzy logic implementation.

controller involve asslgnmg membership functions to the crisp inputs and outputs, and generating knowledge or rule base according to the human operator's experience. Real-time operations of fuzzy control start with the fuzzification of crisp input measurements. Then the inference engine determines which output rules are on at an instant. In the last operation, the output rules are defuzzified to a crisp value as illustrated in Fig. 3.1.

The fuzzy contro]]er shown in Fig. 3.1 has four main components as fo]]ows: 1. The "rule base" holds the knowledge in the form of a set of linguistic control rules that may contain fuzzy variables as conditions and actions. In general, the representation of fuzzy variables depends on the nature of a universe of discourse. A universe of discourse contains aJ] elements of a variable space for a given problem. The membership functions for input (conditions) and output (action)

· variables have to be chosen for effective control. The rule base array is formed from the linguistic control rules and membership functions. 2. The fuzzification interface simply modifies the inputs (crisp to fuzzy sets) so that they can be interpreted and compared to the rules in the rule-base. 3. The inference mechanism evaluates which linguistic output rules are relevant at the current time, using the compositional rule of inference. 4. The defuzzification interface converts the linguistic output rules as determined by inference mechanism to a crisp output value.

3.3 Amplitude Control Method
In this section, an amplitude-based fuzzy controller is developed to achieve and maintain resonance conditions for a dynamic system having linear stiffness, varying mass and damping. Fuzzy model identification consists of three basic sub-problems [21]: 1. Structure identification involves finding the input and output variables; assigning membership functions to these variables; and determining the number of fuzzy rules comprising the underlying model. 2. Parameter estimation involves the determination of unknown parameters in the model using some optimization method based on both linguistic information obtained from operating experience and the general response of the actual physical system. Structure identification and parameter estimation are interwoven, and either of them cannot be independently identified without resort to another.

3. Model validation involves testing the model based on some perfonnance criteria, e.g. accuracy. If the model does not pass the test, then the structure has to be redefined and parameters have to be estimated again. This methodology is used for estimation of parameters and designing of the fuzzy control. The operators used are listed in Table 3.1 .

3.4 Controller Input and Output
The controller input and output are chosen to mimic the operator behavior. The motor frequency can be varied by varying the control voltage being supplied to its motor drive. In manual operations, the operator changes the motor frequency through the control voltage and then observes the system amplitude. This procedure is repeated until the maximum amplitude is achieved. The chosen inputs to represent the system behavior are:
1. L1Vj is the voltage change (indirectly controls the motor frequency).

2.

Mn is the corresponding nonnalized amplitude change (section 3.4.1).

The system response depends on the motor frequency. The motor frequency is a linear function of the control voltage (0 - 8.25V) being supplied to the motor drive. Thus, an output chosen to control the system is the required control voltage change, L1Vo , to be sent to motor drive.

3.4.1 Normalization
Nermalizatien maps the physical values ef the current precess state variables into' a nermalized universe ef disceurse (nermalized demain). Crisp amplitude input change divided by current maximum amplitude, i.e., M / Amax ' is the nermalized input to' the centreller.

3.5 Fuzzification
Fuzzificatien is related to' the vagueness and imprecisien in a natural language. It is a subjective valuatien, which transferms a measurement into' a valuatien ef a subjective value. Hence, it ceuld be defined as a mapping from an ebserved crisp input space to' fuzzy sets in 'certain input universes ef disceurse. Fuzzificatien plays an impertant functien in dealing with uncertain infermatien which might be ebjective er subjective in nature. In this applicatien, the ebserved data are crisp. Since data manipulatiens in a fuzzy logic centreller are based en fuzzy set theery, fuzzificatien is necessary during an earlier stage. The cheice ef membership functiens fer each linguistic variable must be perfermed. This can be dene by classificatien ef the centrel input and eutput into' Classed fuzzy sets as shewn in Figs. 3.2-3.4. Parameters are adjusted until satisfactery perferma.nce is achieved. The membership functiens are divided between negative and pesitive universe ef disceurse, fer efficient decisien making. Triangular membership functiens are used fer fuzzificatien ef crisp measurements. Triangular membership functiens were tested during simulations using the Matlab fuzzy

Knowledge Base

The knowledge base of a fuzzy logic controller is comprised of a database and fuzzy control base. Database concepts are used to characterize linguistic control rules and a fuzzy data manipulation. The fuzzy control base characterizes the control goals by means of a set of linguistic control rules. It should be noted that the correct choice of the membership function plays an essential function in a successful application. The representation of uncertain information with fuzzy sets brings up the problem of quantifying such information. Fuzzy sets represent the meaning of the linguistic variables of the input and output variables. Six fuzzy sets are used for both inputs; and eight fuzzy sets are used fOf the output. A fuzzy system is characterized by a set of linguistic control statements. It is in the form of "IF-THEN" rules. These rules are easily implemented by fuzzy conditional statements. In fuzzy logic, the collection of fuzzy control rules that are expressed as fuzzy conditional statements forms the rule set. The proper choice of input and output variables is essential to characterize the operation of fuzzy system. At resonance, the vibrations amplitude is significantly higher than non-resonant conditions.

I

This fundamental characteristic is used for designing the rule base. Consider any general vibration response, Fig. 3.5. At any instant t, assume that the operating frequency corresponds to state 1, Fig. 3.5; and the state 1 amplitude and control voltage values are stored in the maximum amplitude and the maximum control voltage variables, respectively. Next possible operating frequencies are states 2, 3, 4 and 5. The controller program changes the operating frequency from state 1 such that the system state becomes either 2 or 3; the amplitude change and the voltage change are positive for these states with respect to state 1. The state 2 or 3 amplitude is greater than the state 1 amplitude, therefore the maximum amplitude and the

·

maximum voltage variables are set to state 2 or 3 amplitude and voltage values, respectively. Thus the rule is "If the voltage change and the amplitude change are positive, then the required voltage change is positive". Similarly consider that the controller program changes the operating frequency from state 1 such that the system state becomes either 4 or 5; the amplitude change is negative for these states; and the voltage change for state 4 is positive and state 5 is negative with respect to the state 1. The maximum amplitude and the maximum voltage variables initial status remains (state 1) because the state 4 or 5 amplitude is lower than the state 1 amplitude. The rules are "If the amplitude change is negative and the voltage change is negative (state 5), then the required voltage change is positive" and "If the amplitude change is negative and the voltage change is positive (state 4), then the required voltage change is negative". Similarly consider that the controller program change~ the operating frequency from state 4 such that the system state becomes 2; the amplitude change is positive and the voltage change is negative for this transition. The maximum amplitude and the maximum voltage change are set to the state 2 from state 4 because the state 2 amplitude is greater than state 4. The rule is "If the amplitude change is positive and the voltage change is negative, then the required voltage change is negative".

Vmax depending upon whether the amplitude change is positive or negative, respectively; ~ew is

the new operating frequency corresponding to Vnew ; Ctku is the operating frequency at which maximum amplitude occurs and D.OJo is the equivalent defuzzified frequency change from fuzzy controller.

3.8 Heuristic Stability and Rules
Heuristic rules establish an outer boundary for the fuzzy output and enforces the controller stability. Thus, heuristic rules check that operating space converges i.e., the current output of fuzzy logic is not greater than previous output of the controller. If the current output is greater than the previous output, the current output is neglected and the previous output is increased or decreased, according to the amplitude change and voltage change, by 0.01 V. The heuristic rules acts as a supervisor for the fuzzy controller output. In addition, if the normalized amplitude difference is greater than 0.8, then the search space is reduced by half. This is so because there is a large variation in amplitude at resonance. Finally, if output from controller : is within the range of (-0.006, 0.006) then the output is reduced to zero.

3.9 Simulation Results
The main objective of simulations is to determine whether amplitude based control can keep the operating frequency in the vicinity of varying natural frequencies for a dynamical system. Eqn. (3.3) simulates the loss of moisture with time. Table 3.3 presents the loss of system mass through evaporation taken at four different times [1]. Based on the measurements, a cubic polynomial, which gives mass reduction as a function of time t, is written as

EXPERIMENTS

4.1 Preparation for Experiments

4.1.1 Hardware Instrumentation
The vibration drier was previously interfaced with a computer only for data acquisition and analysis. To complete the control loop, the computer output was interfaced with the motor drive. Since the Visual Designer high speed analog output block can output non-isolated 0-1 OV or

± 10V analog voltage, a simple visual diagram program was written and the non-isolated

voltage (0-10V) was measured at a terminal board. The next step was to make the'motor dri ve controller (KBMW120) compatible with the computer output voltage. Because the motor control drive. requires isolated 0- lOV DC analog voltage, a module is required to convert a non-isolated voltage to an isolated voltage. After system analysis and market search were done, a 5B-SCM5B49-05 voltage output module, a connector and a coaxial wire were procured for achieving signal isolation. Terminal board jumpers J 1, H 17 are connected; jumpers 12, H 18 are disconnected. The 5B isolation module is connected to channel 7 of the terminal board, which is equivalent to channel 1 of the high speed analog output module block in the Visual Designer program. The coaxial wire is connected to terminals "+". and "-" of the terminal board. The potentiometer is disconnected from the motor drive control. The motor drive control terminals "P2" and "F-" are connected to terminals "+" and "-", respectively, through the coaxial wires. This completes the hardware requirements and interfacing. The completed experimental setup is shown in Fig. 4.1.

The sensitivity for the experimental setup is O.lOg/m V, i.e., if an Fast Fourier transform (FFf) analysis gives a peak value of 1 millivolt, then the system peak acceleration is 0.1 g, where g is the gravitational constant (9.S1 m1s 2 ).

4.1.5 Peak Acceleration.
Time domain signals contain external, analog to digital conversion, and other noises. These signals are analyzed to the frequency domain using the FFT. In the frequency domain, acceleration at the motor frequency is significantly higher as compared to the acceleration due to the noise. This characteristic is used for getting the peak acceleration value from the frequency domain signal.

4.2 Programming
At startup, a pulse of 5 volts is sent to the motor drive. The eccentric weights produce a sinusoidal excitation. The vibration signal is acquired and analyzed. The Visual Designer program, Fig. 4.3, calculates the amplitude and voltage change, and then sends these values to an Excel worksheet. Matlab program, Fig. 4.4, reads the amplitude and voltage changes from the Excel worksheet and fuzzifies the crisp inputs. Then, the fuzzy inference engine determines which output rules are on, and defuzzifies the output rules to a crisp output. The heuristic rules check the stability of the fuzzy output. The Visual Designer program reads the crisp output and updates the motor drive control voltage, accordingly. In Fig. 4.3 arid 4.4, abs(x), is absolute

4.2.1 Visual Designer program
The Visual Designer program (Fig. 4.5) was designed for data acquisition, processing and control. Constant block 5 (Fig. 4.5) will be referred as 5 block or 5; other blocks will be similarly referred throughout program discussion. For better understanding, the blocks are referenced with the relevant figures numbers inside the parenthesis. It is recommended for better understanding of the Visual Diagram programs to study the function of each block as outlined in Appendix D. Control voltage (0-8.25 volts) and motor frequency (corresponding) terms are used as synonyms in the program discussion. The logical blocks represented with signs in the program are double quoted e.g. "- -" to avoid confusion in the program discussion. The constant block 5 provides an initial control voltage of 5 volts through FBI and Ramp Output blocks (Fig. 4.5) to the motor drive. SB block (Fig. 4.6) of the Ramp Output block contains encoding for smooth acceleration/deacceleration of motor speed. Details of the SB block are shown in Fig. 4.7. If Reqd Speed (required speed) is greater than Prev Speed (previous speed), then ">" block (Fig. 4.6) sends a high (True) signal else the ">" block sends a low (False) signal to the SB block. The SB block has identical logic and blocks for the high and the low signal from the ">" block, expect until the execution of Do.. While 1 block (Figs. 4.8 and 4.9).

extreme frequencies associated with an empty bed and a fully loaded bed. For a fully loaded bed, there exists no room for fluidization. The grains behave like a constant mass. The fuzzy control was able to keep the variation of operating frequency within a range of ± 4%. System mass was increased from 0 to 1 kg with a step size of 0.5 kg. System mass was decreased from 1 to 0 kg with a step size of 0.5 kg. The results for these experiments are shown in Figs. 4.18 to 4.21. Due to fluidization, the operating frequency of a loaded system is almost the same as for an empty bed. This phenomenon is more dominant for black eye grains than for chick pea grains. Fluidization was visually confirmed.

Blackeye grains were fluidized at lower acceleration as compared to chickpeas grains. The minimum frequency required for fluidization of black eye grains is 100\ler than that for chick pea grains. The study of mass increment for black eye grains was conducted for establishing the robustness of the controller. Initially, the system was empty; and then two increments, each of 0.5 kg, were used to load the system. The system response is given in Figs. 4.26 to 4.31. 46

The third setup contained dry grains and damped grains. Equal masses of dry and damped grains were used. The objective was to study the effect of damping on fluidization and amplitude response. The fluidization was visually confinned. The fluidization occurred at a peak acceleration of 4 g's for the wet grains and 2 g's for the dry grains. The response curves are shown in Figs. 4.32 to 4.35.

Table 4.6 shows that the system loaded with the same mass (1.12 kg) of dry or wet grains has almost identical resonant frequency. This was expected because, for a low damping coefficient, there is very little change in resonant frequency. The system vibration amplitude is lower for wet grains (4.29 mm) compared to dry grains (4.72 mm). The controller was tested for various conditions. It can be concluded that the controller has preformed its functions effectively.

CHAPTERS

CONfLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

5.1 Conclusions
A fuzzy logic controller is developed and implemented for a resonant vibration dryer. With

r

the controller, the grain drier may operate automatically at the resonant condition to achieve the best possible drying efficiency. Various experiments were performed for the drying system loaded with different amounts of grains and different types of grains including the empty-load situation. The system response curves showed that the controller is effective for all situations. During the experiments, grain fluidization was achieved and verified visually under the designed resonant condition. The Lagrange equations were used to establish equations of motion of an empty system having three degrees of freedom. The results from the three degrees-of-freedom analysis were used for the placement of an accelerometer.

5.2 Future work
A mathematical model may be developed for the effective force transferred to grains and the minimum amplitude requirement for fluidization. A moisture sensor may be brought into the control system for the purpose of monitoring and terminating the drying processes. The digital signal acquired may be filtered before transforming to the frequency domain. To achieve pure translational motion, guide rails may be replaced with vertical slides and other mechanisms. The controller can be developed further for multiple degrees of freedom.

Max_volts input (Fig. A.3) of Checkfor voltage block (Fig A3). The Checkfor voltage block

is designed for providing initial voltage of 3.8 Volt and then, update and send new voltages, in incremental steps of 0.1 Volts (parameter set in Chang_volt block) until 8.25 Volts, to motor drive. For every updated voltage (new motor speed), Data_Acq block (Fig. AI) starts acquiring data, details are given earlier in section 4.2.1; and the system states are written in ASCII format to a file through Filew block (Fig A.l). The ASCII file can be read through tab limited· Excel fonnat. The ASCII file was then opened through an Excel worksheet. All response curves were plotted using the Excel worksheet. Other blocks are used for proper functioning of the program.

A.2 Machine modification

The original system response is shown in Figs. A.4 to A.6. The acceleration becomes stagnant beyond 22 Hz, Fig. A.4. The motor did not accelerate, even as a higher control voltage (0-8.25 volts) is being sent to the motor drive, beyond 22 Hz. The motor was calibrated without vibration, Fig. A.6 and was able to achieve 1800 rpm or 30 Hz. The system was designed so that the motor vibrates with the vibratory dryer. The motor withdraws 90 Volts and 0.5 Amperes from the motor drive when vibrating at 22 Hz. This drives the motor drive into the saturation state. The motor is rated for 90 Volts and 0.5 Ampere. The control drive parameters were set so that it goes into saturation at 90 Volts and 0.7 Amperes. The motor and its drive were disassembled from the system. The motor was stalled in a vice. An ammeter was connected in series with the motor drive, and the 0.5 Ampere rating fuse was replaced with a 3/4 Ampere rating fuse. After switching the motor drive on, the current regulation trim pot was adjusted

so that the ammeter reads 0.7 Ampere (the motor stalled) when the motor drive just goes into saturation (Red bulb light up on circuit board of the control drive).The motor was reassembled and tested but still the motor drive goes into the saturation state. There was not much load on the motor, i.e., two phenolic gears and two eccentric masses of 160 grams/each. Friction between guide rails and sliders is small. After reviewing several designs, it was decided to alter the mechanical behavior of the system. For fluidization, effective acceleration greater than 1 g is required. As system acceleration is greater than 10 g's, mass can be added to reduce the natural frequency so that the motor drive does not into saturation and the acceleration is still greater than 1 g. Equation A.I is used for calculating the required additional mass. An additional mass of 8.625 kg is needed to reduce the system natural frequency to 17 Hz. There were several options available to place this weight e.g., replacing pegboard with mild steel (M.S.) sheet, assembling M.S. flats on an outer boundary of Lucite container etc. After reviewing several designs, two .M.S. flats (75 mm wide, 25 rnm thick and 275 mm long) were drilled and assembled to the side of the Lucite wall container.

PHYSICAL PROPERTIES B.1 Center of Gravity B.1.1 Practical Method
If an object is attached to a flexible string whose other end is pivoted to a frame, and

allowed to move in a gravitational field, equilibrium will occur in such a way that the center of gravity becomes collinear with the string direction. This fundamental characteristic is used to detennine the center of gravity. The drying machine was dissembled from the base plate and attached to one end of a thin flexible steel wire. The other end of steel wire was pivoted to a steel frame. At equilibrium, the steel wire was projected on the surface of machine such that it gives two points. Ideally, if these two points are connected an.d extended, it should be collinear with the steel wire. Only one more set of points were sufficient to establish the C.G. Similarly machine was attached at two different points and projected points on the machine were marked. Short aluminum channels of the machine were attached to the steel wire. The next step was to establish frame of reference to locate dimensions of the points. Lower right front comer (looking at front of motor) of short aluminum channel was used as the origin and distances of all points from the origin were measured. The directions of axes considered are X - Axis is
formed by the right hand coordinate system; Y-Axis is parallel to the motor axis and positive

A 3D CAD model of the aluminum channel was· created. The corresponding points (3 pairs) were located and joined by the three dimensio!lal lines. The mean of the measured distances between different points were taken and averaged. As the experimental result was not accurate an analytical method was used to verify the results, details are given in section B.l.2. The results were within a range of 5 % error compared to the

method.

B.2.1 Experimental setup
Two mild steel flat (30 mm x 6 mm, 710 mm Ig.) were used for experimental setup. After drilling 7mm holes, flat were screwed together at the drilled holes. After securing the holes, the other end was bent at 90°. The plates were clamped to a member of the frame as shown in Figs. B.5 and B.6. The original bolts (located at the same height and at opposite end to each other) of the machine were replaced with long bolts. These long bolts were assembled to the corresponding holes in the flat. Final adjustments were made, so that machine sits properly. The free undamped vibration theory and parallel axis of theorem were used to calculate the moment of inertia about the CO. of the system.

This block is used to generate timing information for low-speed data acquisition and control application. This block is used to combine two or more data buffers into a single multi-channel buffer. This block obtains a subset of a data buffer by copying N data points from its input to its output starting at the specified OFFSET. Formats output string with input buffer values according to template. Displays the first point of a numeric input buffer. Accepts two inputs, an initial value input and a feedback input. The first time the block executes, the output is equal to the initial value input. Thereafter, the output is equal to the feed back input.
