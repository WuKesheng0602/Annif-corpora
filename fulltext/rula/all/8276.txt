AXIAL STRENGTH OF LIGHTWEIGHT SELF-CONSOLIDATING CONCRETE COLUMNS WITH ENGINEERED CEMENTITIOUS COMPOSITE CONFINEMENT

Sandeep Parajuli Master of Applied Science, 2018 Department of Civil Engineering Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada

ABSTRACT Axial load behavior of confined columns with engineered cementitious composite (ECC) wrapping was investigated through experimental, analytical and finite element (FE) investigations. The variables in the study were: geometry (cylindrical and rectangular), presence or absence of longitudinal and tie reinforcement, ECC wrap thickness, types of concrete core (lightweight and normal weight self-consolidating concrete) and type of loading (applied through both core and wrap or core only). The effect of these variables on axial load-deformation response, strain characteristics, failure modes, ductility, energy absorption capacity and axial strength were evaluated. The confined concrete strengths predicted from existing analytical and developed FE models were found to be in good agreement with those of experiments. The axial load capacity and ductility were increased for columns with highest ECC wrap thickness (50 mm) while thinner wrap increased stiffness instead of ductility. Canadian code conservatively predicted axial strength of columns having increased thickness of ECC wrap.

CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION 1.1 General

Conventional concrete is a brittle cementitious material with low tensile strength and crack resistance, limited deformability and weak impact resistance properties. Such properties limit the applications of concrete in construction applications. The compressive strength of concrete is the main parameter for the design of concrete structures. However, as the strength increases, the brittleness of concrete increases, leading to less ductile concrete. The need of strengthening old, damaged and deteriorated concrete in North America led the researcher to look for a new technology that could give a concrete relatively high ductility and strength. One of the way to enhance the strength and ductility is by providing confinement to the concrete. The confinement can be achieved by either wrapping, jacketing or filament winding. Various theories have been developed to predict the behavior of confined concrete columns using different confining material like steel, high strength concrete and composite materials. The use of steel tubes and fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) sheet as a thin confining material for columns has been studied extensively. Using Engineered Cementitious Composite (ECC) as a confining material can add to the strength and ductility of columns but a very little work has been done on ECC as confining material. ECC features high ductility and damage tolerance with fine multiple cracking under mechanical loading, including tensile and shear loadings. With material optimization, it is reported that tensile strain capacity in excess of 3% under uniaxial tensile loading has been obtained even with low fiber content. Compressive strength of ECC varies from 30MPa to 90MPa, elastic modulus 20 GPA to 25 GPa and compressive strain capacity around 0.45-0.65% (Li, 2007). Jacketing by ECC is gaining attention due to its highly ductile nature. Confining columns made of comparatively weak lightweight concrete (LWC) with ECC wrapping can enhance strength and ductility. This warrants research to understand the structural behavior of columns especially made of lightweight concrete confined by ECC wrapping under axial compression.

Research significance

Most of the existing researches have been focused on columns confined with FRP and steel tubes on circular column sections and analytical models for confined concrete strength and axial strength are derived for circular sections. The thickness of confining material is considered small compared to the section of confined columns, so the confining material is treated as a thin section, that is, a lamina or a sheet, for analysis. Again, very limited research studies have been conducted on rectangular and square columns using confining ECC of variable thickness. Lightweight selfconsolidating concrete (LWSCC) is comparatively new technology combining the beneficial properties of lightweight weight concrete (LWC) and self-consolidating concrete (SCC). Until to date no research has been conducted on reinforced LWSCC columns confined with ECC wrapping. Therefore, the structural behavior of confined reinforced/unreinforced tied/untied columns made LWSCC with ECC wrapping needs to be studied compared with their conventional SCC counterparts to assess the strength, ductility and confined concrete strength characteristics. The applicability of existing analytical and code-based models for strength and confined concrete strength should also need to be verified for columns made of new ECC wrapping material. 1.3 Research objective and scopes

This research consists of experimental, analytical and finite element (FE) investigations on concrete columns with ECC wrapping subjected to axial compression loading to failure. The variables in this study are: shape (circular and rectangular), core concrete types (SCC and LWSCC), presence or absence of longitudinal and tie reinforcement, thickness of ECC wrapping and types of loading. The main objectives of this research are to:  Conduct the experimental and FE investigations on the axial load behavior of reinforced/unreinforced tied/untied cylindrical/square SCC/LWSCC columns with or without ECC wrapping of variable thickness subjected to Type A and Type B loadings (load applied through both core and ECC warp only or through SCC/LWSCC concrete core).  Analyze and compare the axial load behavior of columns based on load carrying capacity, load-deflection response, stress-strain development in core and wrap, load sharing among core/wrap/reinforcement, ductility, energy absorbing capacity and failure modes by 2

providing emphasis on the effect of ECC wrap thickness, tie reinforcement, longitudinal reinforcement and type of concrete core (LWSCC/SCC).   Carry out experimental tests on individual concrete types to determine mechanical and fracture properties. Compare the experimental results such as axial load capacity, confined concrete strength, stress-strain developments with those predicted by analytical/code-based equations and FE models to validate and evaluate their performance.  1.4 Derive conclusion and make recommendations for future research studies. Thesis Outline

This thesis consists of six chapters which are outlined as follows: Chapter 1 discusses the need for confining columns and different types of confining materials. It introduces ECC as a possible confining concrete chosen due to its ductile characteristics. Chapter 2 details literature review on materials used for composite columns and their various usages. Literature on confinement effect on concrete is also included. Chapter 3 details geometric dimensions of column specimens. Column casting process are described along with instrumentation and testing of columns. Chapter 4 reports experimental axial load-displacement, failure modes, axial capacities and stressstrain characteristics for tested columns. Experimental results from each type of columns are compared. Strength enhancement and confinement of different specimens are compared. Chapter 5 compares the experimental results of the tested columns with those obtained from finite element models, existing theoretical and Canadian code-based equations. Chapter 6 summarizes the findings of the research and provides recommendations for future research study.

CHAPTER TWO LITERATURE REVIEW 2.1 Introduction

Numerous research studies have been conducted in the past on concrete confinement and various models to define the behavior of confined concrete have been established. This chapter presents a literature review on various types of concretes, their applications and performance related to confinement in different structural elements such as confined composite columns, existing concrete confinement models, finite element modeling of confined concrete columns and other topics related to this research including tests and testing methods. Existing equations and codebased procedures for the determination of confined concrete strength and axial strength of confined columns are also discussed. 2.2 Self-consolidating concrete (SCC)

2.2.1 Introduction SCC is a highly flowable and stable concrete that spreads and fills in the forms without consolidation as shown in Fig 2.1 (Khayat et al., 2000). Due to its flowing nature, SCC was used in structures with highly congested reinforcement bar in Japan for the areas with high seismic activity during late 1980's (Ozawa et al., 1989; Hossain and Lachemi, 2010). SCC is finding increased use in recent years and providing excellent alternative to conventional concrete (JSCE 1998).

As the water content is low due to use of superplasticizer, it provides fluidity and segregation resistance to give homogeneous concrete with ease of placement, less honey combs, high durability and superior finish. This can reduce the overall construction and maintenance cost. Thus, using SCC in construction projects can reduce the cost and time of concrete construction (Okamura 1996; EFNARC 2005; Yahia et al., 1999; Lachemi et al., 2003; Hossain and Lachemi, 2010; Hossain et al., 2010; Hassan et al., 2010). 2.2.2 SCC applications One of the comparative investigation using normal concrete, shotcrete and SCC was done by Lacombe et al. (1999) as an overhead repair material. These concretes were used to repair three concrete blocks at a depth of approximately 40 mm on one surface of each block. SCC mixture used viscosity modifying agent (VMA) to reduce bleeding and segregation. After seven days, results showed that the normal concrete did not fill all the section and developed considerable segregation and large air pockets. SCC and shotcrete had a good bonding and performed well but the use of admixture for SCC made it expensive while skilled labor requirement for shotcrete made the cost to increase significantly. Thus, the study suggested more research to develop cost-effective SCC. Other applications for SCC as a repair material includes repair of chloride-induced deteriorated cast-in-place bridge built in the 1960's in the Swiss Alps, rehabilitation of the Webster parking garage in Sherbrooke and the rehabilitation of the Beauhamois Dam near Montreal (Campion and Jost 2000). Thus, SCC is finding increased use now a day, for example, in the construction of bridge bearing pads as shown in Fig.2.2.

Light weight self-consolidating concrete (LWSCC)

2.3.1 Introduction One of the latest innovations in concrete technology is the development of LWSCC combining the benefits of traditional SCC and lightweight concrete (LWC). LWSCC contributes less dead load to the structure and has better insulation and thermal characteristics with compressive strength up to 60MPa. As per ASTM C 330 (2017), structural LWSCC has minimum 28 days compressive strength of 17 MPa and density in between 1120 kg/m 3 and 1920 kg/m3. Generally, LWSCCs are designed based on experiments and empirical relationships. As lightweight aggregates (LWAs) are used, there is always a chance of segregation. Silica fume has been used for preventing segregation by making the mixture cohesive in recent studies (Lotfy, Hossain and Lachemi, 2016). ASTM classifies LWAs into three groups, structural, structural-insulating and insulating - ranges of strength, density and thermal properties vary in each of these groups. The failure of LWSCC occurs from interface between aggregates and cement paste matrix, aggregate itself or from the cement paste matrix. The tendency to form microcracks is reduced as the property of aggregates and cement matrix are similar. 2.3.2 LWSCC applications Initial application of LWSCC was reported in Japan in 1922 for the construction of a cable-stayed bridge's main girder. LWSCC has found its place in precast stadium benches (Hubertova and Hela, 2007) and pre-stressed beams with spans reaching up to 20 m (Dymond, 2007). Various types of LWSCCs like foamed concrete and volcanic pumice aggregate concrete (VPC) were used as infill material in concrete filled steel tube (CFST) columns (Hunaiti, 1996; Hossain, 2003). Foamed concrete LWSCC had higher axial capacity contribution and more confinement compared with lightweight aggregate concrete, potentially due to better homogeneity of foamed concrete. 2.4 Engineered cementitious composite (ECC)

2.4.1 Introduction ECC was developed to account for brittle behavior of normal concrete and to exhibit tensile ductility (Li, 2008). High-Performance Fiber-Reinforced Composites (HPFRCC) were developed using continuous and discontinuous fibers which showed high degree of ductility and strain hardening behavior. ECC was developed as a branch of HPFRCC with moderate tensile strength 6

from 2 MPa to 6 MPa (Fischer et al., 2003; Li, 1993). ECC features high ductility and damage tolerance with fine multiple cracking under mechanical loading, including tensile and shear loadings. With material optimization, it is reported that tensile strain capacity in excess of 3% under uniaxial tensile loading has been obtained even with low fiber content . Typical ECC mix design of ECC using cement, silica sand, fly ash, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fiber and high range water reducing admixtures (HRWRAs) is presented in Table 2.1 (Li. 2003). Table 2.1: Typical mix design of ECC* material (Li, 2003) Cement 1 Water 0.58 Silica Sand 0.8 Fly Ash 1.2 High Water Reducing Admixture (HRWRA) 0.013

*2% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fiber - ratios are by mass Generally, fiber reinforced composites use high volume of fiber so special processing is required for the placement of the concrete. High volume of fiber is more costlier and weigh more. The composite properties depend on the fiber, matrix and interface properties, which can be engineered to obtain strain hardening and durable concrete such as Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECCs). Strain hardening material continues to carry load after crack initiates with large deformation. This can be seen from the typical uniaxial tensile stress-strain curves of an ECC reinforced with 2% PVA fibers showing high tensile ductility of about 5% as shown in Fig.2.3 (Li, 2003).

Fig. 2.3: Uniaxial tensile stress-strain curves of an ECC with 2% PVA fibers (Li, 2003) 7

The condition for strain hardening for concrete is possible when a steady state crack extension occur and the initial crack strength must not exceed the fiber bridging strength. Li (1998) has expressed the critical volume for fiber fraction as:  = 
 (
 )  

(2.1)

where  : fiber volume fraction;  : crack tip toughness;  : snubbing factor;  : fiber/matrix  frictional bond strength;  : length of fiber;  : diameter of the fiber;  : crack opening corresponding to the maximum bridging stress. Fig. 2.4 represents interrelationship among fiber volume fraction, matrix toughness and interfacial fiber-matrix bond strength as per Eq. 2.1 for design purposes.

Fig. 2.4: Matrix toughness and interfacial property effect on critical Vf (Li, 1998) Several research studies have been done on Ryerson University on ECC materials to make it cost effective and technically efficient. Investigations done on ECC mixtures by replacing crushed sand with silica sand showed higher ductility for static loading and less damage under fatigue (Sherir, Hossain and Lechami, 2015). A study on composite slab with profiled steel deck comparing ECC and SCC showed ECC composite slab superior performance in terms of strength, ductility, energy 8

absorption and shear bond resistance (Hossain et al. 2016). Inclusion of magnesium oxide in ECC showed self-healing capacity with higher flexure strength recovery (Sherir, Hossain and Lechami, 2017). 2.4.2 ECC applications ECC is being used in number of projects recently. A 60 years old Mitaka Dam near Hiroshima had a severely damaged surface and had to be repaired against cracks, spalling and water leakage. ECC with thickness of 20 mm was sprayed on the surface over the 600 m 2 (Fig. 2.5)

Fig. 2.5: Spray repair of the Mitaka dam with ECC for water-proofing (Sakata et al., 2004) ECC was also used for coupling beams (Fig. 2.6) for high rise building in Japan at seismic zone due to its high energy absorbing capacity (Maruta et al., 2005). In 2002, Michigan department of transportation (MDOT) used ECC and patching concrete they have been using, in two sections of a deteriorated bridge deck (Fig.2.7). With live load and passing of more than six complete winter, the ECC patch showed minor microcracking less than 50 m, whereas the repair concrete showed localized cracks of 3.5 mm thus repatch was done. ECC link slabs were also used to construct joint free bridges (Qian et al. 2009, Hossain et al. 2016), for example in Grove Street Bridge in Michigan (Fig. 2.8).

Column, concrete confinement and confinement models

CSA A23.3 (2014) defines columns as a member with a ratio of height to least lateral dimension of three or greater, used primarily to support axial compressive loads. Slenderness ratio is an important factor in deciding stability of column which is given by Eq. 2.2: Slenderness ratio = klu/r where lu = unsupported length, r= radius of gyration and k = effective length factor Based on this ratio, a column can be categorized as: (a) Short Columns - strength of such column is derived from equilibrium of forces developed in column cross section, (b) Slender Columns such type of column is susceptible to buckling and second order (P-) effect. CSA A23.3 (2014) recommends that slenderness effect in non-sway frames can be ignored if following condition Eq. 2.3 holds good: klu/r

where M1/M2  -0.5; M1 is the smaller factored end moment and M2 is the larger factored end moment. Pf is the factored axial force, f'c is the specified compressive strength of concrete, Ag is the gross sectional area of column. 2.5.1 Research on confined concrete columns There are many literatures available on modeling of confined concrete column, mostly done on circular and rectangular columns with axial load. Square columns are suggested to be converted to an equivalent circular section for analysis. More studies have been carried out to find out the effect of confinement and Jacketing using different materials like fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) wraps, E-glass fibers and carbon, steel tube and aramid fiber. ECC is finding its way for confinement due to its strain hardening property. Stress strain confinement model developed by Richart et al. (1929), Newman and Newman (1972), and Mander et al. (1988) were extended for FRP and CFST columns to predict the strength enhancement as a function of confining pressure by Fardis and Khalili (1982). These equations overestimate the strength of confined concrete. Experiments conducted by Nanni and Bradford (1995) for 150 x 300 mm cylinders confined by FRP showed increased strength and were comparable to models given by Mander et al. (1988) and 11

Fardis and Khalili (1982). These models proved to be sufficiently accurate for prediction of the strength but noted that passive confinement was not effective for the loading below unconfined concrete strength. Mirmiran et al. (1998) investigated 30 cylindrical specimens and found strengths were less than that were given by existing confinement models. They concluded that the confinement was effective for length to diameter ratio from 2:1 to 5:1. Experiments done by Saafi et al. (1999) on short columns encased by FRP tubes indicated that the strength increase depends on strength of unconfined concrete, tube thickness and mechanical properties of the composite tube. Lam and Teng (2003) proposed two portions of stress-strain curve, first parabolic and second linear, to model the confinement. Rochette and Labossiere (2000) concluded that confined strength increases with specimen with rounded corners and thickness of fabric. Test conducted on carbon wrapped concrete columns by Shahawy et al. (2000) showed that the confinement model agrees with both carbon and glass fiber fabric when dilation of concrete is incorporated as a function of the stiffness of the jacket. Hossain (2003) found that the axial capacity of thin walled composite (TWC) column was about 30% higher than the sum of the individual capacities of concrete core and steel skin confinement. Some of the analytical models are given below: 2.5.2 Models of confined concrete Some of the existing models for confined concrete are presented in the following sections. 2.5.2.1 Karbhari and Gao (1997) Karbhari and Gao (1997) have given the following model for compressive strength of confined concrete: = 1 +  (2.4)

As per Richart et al. (1929) experiments, the average value of the k1 = 4.1, whereas Balmer (1949) reported the value between 4.5 and 7.0 with an average value of 5.6.

2.5.2.2 Mander, Priestley and Park (1988) Mander et al. (1988) developed a model from multi-axial failure surface for confined concrete by both circular and rectangular ties. They suggested that the entire stress strain range was dependent on the peak stress and strain regardless of the arrangements of the reinforcement. They used equation given by Popovics (1973) to describe entire stress strain curve. Stress- strain relations of confined and unconfined concrete for monotonic loading according to Mander et al. (1988) are presented in Fig.2.8.

ACI 440 (2008) has proposed the equivalent circular column diameter as:  =  +  Lam and Teng (2003) defined equivalent diameter (D) as:  = where b and h are sectional dimension of rectangular columns. 2.6 The finite element method (FEM) and modelling (2.19) (2.18)

One of the most popular methods in the numerical analysis applied in engineering is the Finite Element Method. The late development of fast electronic computers has provided the designerengineer with robust, quick and powerful tools especially in the challenging area of geomechanics. The finite element approach was first investigated by Turner et al. (1956) for use in structural analysis. The principal idea behind the method is the subdivision of a continuous material into smaller elementary units the behavior of which can be easily described and expressed by known mathematical relations. Thus, the behavior of the whole can be simulated by a series of elements interacting with each other following some principles. Today's numerical codes offer a variety of elements for discretizing continuous systems and each element offers certain advantages and disadvantages. The most usual are the constant strain triangular element (CST) and the isoparametric quadrilateral element (Q4). The greatest advantage in the use of finite element modeling is the ability to closely represent the true conditions of the problem including gradual alterations in the model. The general steps in the formulation of a finite element model for a stressstrain problem are:   Division of model into discrete elements connected at nodal points. Recognition and expression of the physical quantities (i.e., displacements) using known functions and by applying appropriate inter-elementary nodal conditions, by

Assembly of all elementary stiffness matrices using appropriate stress-strain model and representation of a continuous system by assembly of a global stiffness matrix. Assembly of elemental equations and insertion of appropriate boundary conditions to obtain overall equilibrium equations. Numerical solution of the system of equations. Back calculation of strains. Final computation of stresses.

2.6.1 Concrete damaged plasticity model (CDP) in Abaqus FEM software The commercial finite element software Abaqus 6.14 (Abaqus Analysis User's Guide, 2014) used continuum model defining tensile cracking and compressive crushing as the failure mechanisms in concrete. Total strain is additive of elastic strain and inelastic strain. CDP model assumes the degradation of elastic modulus (E) by introducing a scalar degradation variable (d) which is shown by Eq. 2.20.  = (1 - ) maximum value of one for total loss of strength.

Fig. 2.11: Damage parameters (ABAQUS Documentation, Abaqus 6.14) Tension stiffening defines strain softening behavior of concrete after failure. Defining tension stiffening also helps to transfer load between cracked concrete and reinforcement bars. One of the way to implement this behavior is to invoke fracture energy criteria in Abaqus model (ABAQUS Documentation, Abaqus 6.14). 2.6.2 Previous research studies conducted on finite element modeling of confined column Most of the research studies done by using finite element modeling involves FRP as a confining material for columns. Yu et al. (2010) modelled a rectangular column in two different ways, one model used equivalent circular section with same area for the confined section of concrete and FRP tube as that of rectangular section with and another model used effective confining pressure and average lateral strain. The test results were in close agreement with FE models ( Fig.2.12).

Mazzucco et al. (2016) developed a damage model for carbon FRP confined column with modified Mazar's damage law (1986) to study the role of cross-section shape. The comparison between FE and experimental results for circular and rectangular confined columns showed that FE result was able to predict axial and transverse response accurately under monotonic compressive loading (Fig.2.13).

Some authors like Kriegh (1976) states that this is a reliable method because it closely resembles the state of stress in a concrete.

22

Fig. 2.14: Slant shear test The test specimen is a composite concrete cylinder or a prism with an interface of 30 0 with the longitudinal axis of the specimen (Fig.2.14). Standard compression test is performed on this cylinder until the failure occurs. The bond strength is obtained by dividing the load carried by the specimen at failure by the area of the bonded surface. 2.7.3 Fracture energy of concrete and testing The fracture energy of a concrete can be determined by three-point bending test using notched beam. This test is similar to the standard modulus of rupture test and the first linear elastic fracture mechanics test standard for metals given by ASTM, 1983 (Bazant, 1992). The testing procedures are simpler with minimal alignment errors. The beam geometry for the test is shown Fig.2.15. The span to depth (S/d) ratio is 4:1 because formulas for opening mode stress-intensity factors for beams are given for S/d = 4 or 8. The test usually consists of the following steps:   The beam is notched to depth ao at mid span by using diamond saw-cut. The load- deflection (LPD) or load-crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) response is recorded continuously by applying constant displacement rate, such that the failure is around in five minutes.  The peak load "P" or the load PQ at the intersection with a secant of slope 95% of initial slope (Fig.2.15), is used to calculate the stress intensity from the following relationship. The stress intensity factor for the beam with notch at the center is given by Shah, Swartz and Ouyang (1995). 23

Several studies have been carried out on axially loaded confined columns using normal concrete and SCC for circular sections. Different models are available to predict the strength of these 24

confined concrete. Most of these research have been focused on using FRP and steel tubes as confinement providing material. Limited number of literatures are available on ECC being used as confining material. Again, the behavior of square confined columns under type A and type B loading also needs to be studied due to lack of literature. So, the need of research using ECC as confining material is necessary for these types of loading. The proposed research will lead to new insight on the mechanical behavior of confined concrete using ECC as a confining material.

CHAPTER THREE EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM 3.1 Introduction An experimental program has been done to study the behavior of short square self-consolidating (SCC) and self-consolidating lightweight concrete (LWSCC) columns under axial compressive loading confined by strain hardening engineered cementitious composite (ECC) in the concrete and structure laboratories of Ryerson University. The first set of tests consisted of casting three LWSCC and three SCC square columns with ECC wrap without using steel ties for longitudinal reinforcing bars. The thickness of ECC warp varied for each column. In the second set, three square LWSCC columns and one square SCC column having longitudinal steel reinforcement and lateral ties were casted with confined ECC wrapping. Third set consisted of three LWSCC and three SCC cylindrical specimens wrapped by ECC layer having varying thickness. The variables for the study consisted of thickness of ECC wrap, type of concrete material used for core of column (SCC and LWSCC), presence or absence of tie reinforcements and type of axial loading on the column, that is, loading applied through the whole cross section (Type A loading) and loading through the core only (Type B loading). Load deformation response, stress-strain curves, ductility index and energy absorption of the columns under Type A and Type B concentric axial loading were then obtained. Fourth set of test consisted of casting standard cylindrical concrete samples to determine compressive strength as per ASTM C469/C469M (2014) and modulus of elasticity and Poisson's ratio for different types of concrete used as per ASTM C39/C39M (2016). 3.2 Description of column and cylinder specimens

All square columns with core cross-section of 150 mm x 150 mm and 900 mm in length were symbolized as `S' (Table 3.1). All cylindrical specimens with core diameter of 150 mm and length of 300 mm were denoted by `C' (Table 3.1). Two different types of concrete were used for casting core specimens - Light Weight Self-Consolidating Concrete (LWSCC) designated as `LW' and Self-Consolidating Concrete (SCC) designated as `SC'. These specimens were wrapped around the perimeter by ECC layer of varying thickness (10 to 50 mm). The thickness of ECC wrap was expressed by the numerical attachment on sample description/designation of specimens ( Table 3.1a-c). Specimens having no ECC wrapping around the core had no numerical attachment. Four 26

longitudinal reinforcing bars of 10 mm diameter were used for square columns (Table 3.1b-c). Ties were used at spacing of 150 mm c/c for six columns and all other columns were casted without ties. Tied columns are symbolized as `T' in the designation of specimens. Table 3.1a-c and Fig. 3.1a-c present the description and dimensions of the square and cylindrical specimens. For example, S-LW-20T represents a longitudinally reinforced square column with 20 mm ECC wrapping around LWSCC core with tie reinforcement. Table 3.1a: Designation for cylindrical column specimens

Two different concrete mixes were used in casting concrete columns. A commercially available SCC was used along with LWSCC and ECC mixes developed at Ryerson University. After casting of core columns with LWSCC or SCC, they were wrapped with ECC jackets. SCC was a pre-blended and pre-packaged high performance flowable concrete containing Portland cement, silica fume, 10 mm aggregate and other carefully selected admixtures. To impart ductility and toughness, only fine aggregates were used for ECC. Silica sand was used as a fine aggregate with the gradations shown in Table 3.2. General use hydraulic cement which meets or exceeds all applicable chemical and physical requirements of ASTM C150/C150M (2018) was used for all purpose. Table 3.2: Gradation for silica sand Sieve number Sieve opening (mm) Passing (%) #40 0.42 100.0 #50 0.30 97.8 #70 0.21 83.1 30 #100 0.15 35.6 #140 0.105 6.3 #200 0.074 0.9 #270 0.053 0.4

Class F fly ash (SiO2: 59.5%, CaO: 5.57%, specific gravity: 2.18) was used as a partial replacement of cement in concrete which increased workability and imparted higher strength and durability. Silica fume (used in LWCC) filled the space between cement particle and formed a binder material called calcium silicate hydrate which gave improved hardened properties. It also helped the LWSCC by preventing segregation by making the mix more cohesive. The physical and chemical properties of silica fume used for LWSCC are SiO2: 52%, CaO: 5% and specific gravity of 2.38. A high range water reducing admixture (HRWRA) helps in making concrete workable with low w/c ratio. For ECC, HRWRA containing polycarboxylate chemical composition is most suitable (Li, 2007). ADVA 757, a commercially available admixture was used in the production of ECC. PVA (Polyvinyl Alcohol) fiber which helps in bridging the crack formations and imparting strain hardening behavior to ECC was used. PVA fiber with a length of 8 mm and a diameter of 39 microns was used for ECC. Coarse and fine furnace slag lightweight aggregate complied with ASTM C 330/330M (2017) was used for making LWSCC. These aggregates were porous in nature and imparted reduced weight of the concrete.10 mm and 6 mm dia. reinforcing bars having stressstrain characteristics shown in Fig. 3.2 and properties (Table 3.3) derived from coupon tests as per Sathiyamoorthy (2016) were used.

Casting of columns with LWSCC core

Formworks were made from plywood to cast columns (Fig. 3.3a). Readymade tubes were used to cast cylindrical specimens. As the light weight aggregates (fine and coarse) had high water absorbing capacity, they were soaked at least for three days before making the concrete mix. The water content of surface dry aggregates was determined to account for the total quantity of water required for the mixture. Mix proportion used of preparing LWSCC is given in Table 3.4.

Fixed horizontal mixture of 250 Liter capacity was used to mix the LWSCC ( Fig. 3.3b). Saturated surface dry (SSD) slag aggregates were fed into the mixer, 75% of the total quantity of water was added and mixed for five minutes. Fly ash, cement and silica fume were added and mixed for one minute. Admixture (HRWRA) and remaining water were added and mixed for 15 minutes to complete the mixing operation. Columns were then casted with this concrete ( Fig. 3.3c-d).

Casting core columns with SCC

Commercial premix blend was used for making SCC. As per manufacturer's recommendation, 2.6 liters of water per 30kg bag was used for mixing. 75% of water required was placed into the fixed horizontal mixture of 250 L capacity and the premix blend was added (Fig. 3.3b). Once the mixer had started, remaining water was added slowly. Mixing was continued till three minutes. After the mix was consistent, the mixer was stopped. Columns were then casted from this concrete. Columns were wrapped with plastic sheets to prevent from moisture lost after casting ( Fig. 3.3e). Columns were demolded after 48 hours of casting and placed in a curing room. 3.6 Casting of ECC wraps around LWSCC and SCC core columns

After 7 days of casting and curing in curing room (maintained at 20 0C and 95±5% RH), square and cylindrical columns were placed in the formworks to cast ECC wrapping of desired thickness. After casting, specimens were wrapped in plastic sheets for 24 hours, cured them for 7 days in the curing room and then air cured in the lab until tested. The mix proportion of ECC is shown in Table 3.5.

Hobart type mixture with a capacity of 20 liters was used for mixing ECC materials. All the materials except PVA fiber was placed in the mixture and mixed for one minute. Water and HRWRA were then added and mixed for two minutes to get homogenous mix. PVA fibers were then added slowly during mixing so that they were distributed uniformly and mixing operation was continued for minimum additional three minutes until uniform mixture was seen. Cylindrical columns were cast from ECC. Square and cylindrical LWSCC and SCC core columns were then wrapped with ECC layers of required thickness ( Fig. 3.4).

34

Control specimens in the form of cylinders and beams were also cast with LWSCC, SCC and ECC to determine their mechanical properties. They were cured under the same conditions as column specimens and tested at the same age.

Fig. 3.4: Casting of ECC wrapping around core columns 3.7 Instrumentation and testing of concrete properties

Experiments for obtaining mechanical properties of concretes were conducted in the laboratory using control specimens made from ECC, LWSCC and SCC by installing strain gauges. These specimens were subjected to loading to failure and continuous data on load and deformation were obtained through computer aided data acquisition systems. 3.7.1 Compressive strength test of concrete cylinders as per ASTM C39/C39M (2014) Standard cylinders of 100 mm x 200 mm were tested as per ASTM C39/C39M (2014) for the compressive strength of LWSCC, SCC and ECC cylinders at the age of testing. The cylinders were loaded in compression to get the failure load (Fig. 3.5). The compressive strength of cylinders was then obtained from the recorded failure load.

One vertical and one horizontal strain gauges were installed at the mid height of 150 mm x 300 mm concrete cylinders (Fig. 3.6) made of LWSCC, SCC and ECC. MTS machine was used to load the specimens under compression. Load verses axial and tangential strain were recorded throughout the loading history until failure through a computer aided data acquisition system. Then the modulus of elasticity and Poisson's ratio were obtained using the gathered data.

3.7.3 Splitting tensile strength test as per ASTM C496/C496M (2011) Standard test cylinders of 100 mm x 200 mm were tested for the splitting tensile strength of LWSCC, SCC and ECC as per ASTM C496/C496M (2011). Test set-up and failed specimens are shown in Fig. 3.7.

Fig. 3.7: Splitting test setup and testing as per ASTM C496/C496M (2011) 3.7.4 Slant shear and bond tests Slant shear test (as shown in Fig. 3.8) was done using two companion cylindrical specimens made of LWSCC-ECC and SCC-ECC (100 mm x 200 mm) which were cast in two halves with an interface angle of 30o with the longitudinal axis of the specimen. They were loaded to failure under compression and the shear strength was obtained by dividing the failure load by the elliptical interface area shown in Fig. 3.8. Bond between ECC wrapping and LWSCC/SCC core was also tested using cylindrical column specimens with ECC wrapping. The test set-up is shown in Fig. 3.9 where compression load was applied through the LWSCC/SCC core allowing core to slide against ECC wrap through a prefabricated hole (equal to the diameter of core concrete) in the steel load bearing plate. The failure load was recorded and the shear bond strength was obtained by dividing the failure load with the contact core-wrap surface area. Two companion specimens were tested.

Fig. 3.10: Notched beam testing The dimensions were designed to meet S/d = 4. The beam was placed on MTS testing machine with the notch facing down. Load was applied continuously with a displacement rate of 0.0008 mm/s till 25% of the failure load. 3.8 Testing and instrumentation of cylindrical columns with ECC confinement

Two horizontal strain gauges, one at the ECC-core interface and other at outer surface of the concrete at mid height (as shown in Fig. 3.11), were installed to monitor tangential/hoop strain development during loading history until failure of the columns. Axial load was applied through the core with a rate of 1mm/minute. Axial load-displacement/strain responses were recorded and failure modes were observed.

Vertical and horizontal stain gauges were installed on the outer surface at the mid-height of S-SC10, S-SC-15, S-SC-20, S-LW-20, S-LW-25 and S-LW-30 columns ( Fig. 3.12). Load was applied through entire area (both core and ECC wrap) using MTS machine with a rate of 1mm/minute. Axial load-displacement (through linear voltage displacement transducers `LVDT')/ strain responses were recorded and the failure modes were observed.

Fig. 3.12: Experimental set-up, instrumentation and testing of square columns For columns S-LW-20T, S-LW-30T, S-LW-50T, and S-SC-50T, a horizontal strain gauge was installed in the tie bar of the core concrete and on the surface of the ECC wrap at the the same level (Fig. 3.13). The load was applied through the core of the column from MTS machine with a rate of 1mm/minute (Fig. 3.13). The axial load-displacement (through linear voltage displacement transducers `LVDT')/ strain responses were recorded, and the failure modes were observed.

CHAPTER FOUR EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 4.1 Introduction

The scope of the experimentation was to study the performance of columns due to confinement provided by ECC wrap. Tests results are analyzed and discussed with special reference to quantification of ECC confinement effect. These analyses are based on load-deflection responses, crack formation and propagation, ductility, energy absorption capacity, ultimate load, failure modes, ECC developments. 4.1.1 Fresh state and mechanical properties of concrete and re-bars Experimental tests were conducted to determine modulus of elasticity, compressive strength, tensile splitting strength, shear bond strength and fracture properties of ECC, LWSCC and SCC used for columns (as described in Chapter 3). Due to it's strain hardening nature, ECC has higher yielding load than LWSCC and SCC. ECC has lower modulus of elasticity than SCC and comparable to LWSCC. Mechanical properties of concretes (modulus of elasticity, Poisson's ratio, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength and fracture characteristics in terms of stress intensity factor and fracture energy) at the age of testing are listed in Table 4.1a. It was observed that all mechanical properties of SCC were higher than those of LWSCC because of the larger aggregate size in its matrix, besides LWSCC had also porous and weak aggregates. On the other hand, ECC had higher mechanical properties of than SCC except lower modulus of elasticity and Poisson's ratio. Fresh state properties in terms of slump flow were determined for each concrete. The values of slump flow are provided in Table 4.1a. 4.1.2 Load vs. strain and deformation behavior during modulus of elasticity test LWSCC cylinder showed linear load-strain curve to 325kN approximately ( Fig. 4.1a). The axial deformation increased non-linearly to 300kN and increased linearly to cracking load of 563 kN. After the cracking load, the slope of the curve started to decrease reaching the peak load of 584.85 kN. wrapping characterstics, material/geometric properties and stress-strain

SCC cylinder showed linear load-strain curve to 235kN approximately ( Fig. 4.1b). The axial deformation increased non-linearly to 300kN and increased linearly to cracking load of 683 kN. After the cracking load, the slope of the curve started to decrease reaching the peak load of 743.73 kN. ECC cylinder showed linear load-strain curve to 300kN approximately ( Fig. 4.1c). The axial deformation increased non-linearly to 250 kN and increased linearly to cracking load of 775 kN. After the cracking load, the slope of the curve started to decrease reaching the peak load of 878.61 kN. 4.1.3 Load vs. displacement behavior during notched beam test Load deflection curve for notched LWSCC beam (Fig. 4.2a) shows that the curve is non-linear upto 0.3 kN and then the load-deflection curve is linear up to the point of first crack, which is approximately 1.0 kN, that is when the propagation of crack starts from pre-cracked section. The slope of the curve starts to decrease to reach the peak load of 1.45 kN and the beam fails showing brittle behavior. SCC notched beam load displacement curve (Fig. 4.2b) did not show change in slope before the failure load of 1.69 kN which indicted sudden failure of the beam. ECC notched beam curve (Fig. 4.2c) showed multiple occurrence of cracks for increasing load indicated by abrupt change in slopes until it reached peak load of 2.15 kN. 4.1.4 Bond strength between two concretes The results obtained from slant shear test and bond test are given in Table 4.1b. It was observed that the slant shear test and interfacial bond test results depended on the compressive strength of the specimen. The compressive strength of SCC was 42 MPa whereas the compressive strength of LWSCC was 33 MPa, so SCC/ECC shear stress was observed higher than LWSCC/ECC. The slant shear test produced higher bond stress than interfacial bond test as compared to bond test.

SCC and LWSCC cylindrical columns

Non-reinforced SCC and LWSCC cylindrical columns confined with ECC wrapping of thickness of 20 mm, 30 mm and 50 mm, respectively were tested by applying compression loading through the 150 mm core only (Type B loading).

46

4.2.1 General behavior of cylindrical columns In general, a small compressive load applied to a confined concrete puts all the cross section of the specimen under compression and due to lower its small Poisson's ratio, it behaves similar to unconfined normal concrete if the load is equal to its compressive strength. Cracks begin to develop when the load is increased more than yield stress of confined concrete, thus increasing Poisson's ratio. This causes failure by radial expansion of the wraping/jacket leading to crack formation. Load-deformation responses obtained from compression test on LWSCC and SCC cylindrical specimens show that the curves start to decrease its slope indicating the reduction of stiffness of the cylinder. The stiffness (ratio of load and deformation) remains constant for initial straight-line segment of the curve. Once micro crack starts developing, the slope of the curve starts decreasing. Crack development is indicated by formation of kinks, that is, abrupt change in slope of load deformation curve during loading stage. Decrease in stiffness was observed in all the confined cylinders. With increasing thickness of ECC, there were more numbers of kink which can be attributed to the bridging effect by ECC fiber. Sharp brittle failure at ultimate load of core cylinder is shifted to higher load and higher deformation due to the presence of ECC Jacket. Two different types of failure mode were identified under axial compression loading. One of the failure was indicated by vertical cracks on the surface of wrap and another type of failure was indicated by inclined cracks due to shear resulting bond stress between ECC wrap and confined concrete and radial expansion of the confined specimen. 4.2.2 Load vs. deformation behavior Load-deformation responses of non-reinforced LWSCC and SCC cylindrical specimens are shown in Fig. 4.1 and Fig. 4.2, respectively with results summarized in Table 4.2. Initial stiffness for all the columns increased gradually with increase in load approximately between 150 kN to 300 kN due to machine stiffness, which depends on various nonlinearity induced due to seating load and non-elastic elements (Hockett and Gillis, 1971). The LWSCC control cylindrical column (C-LW) without any ECC wrap had a peak load of approximately 584 kN with axial displacement of 2.93 mm. The peak stiffness (peak load/peak deformation) of the control cylinder C-LW was 200 kN/mm. C-LW-20 column (with 20 mm ECC wrap) sustained a peak load of 759 kN load with axial deformation of 4.26 mm. The peak load in 47

C-LW-20 column increased 30% and there was 45% increase in deformation at peak load. The peak stiffness (peak load/peak deformation) of the cylindrical column C-LW-20 was 178 kN/mm which is 11% less than the stiffness of control column. C-LW-30 column (with 30 mm ECC wrap) had increased load (peak) carrying capacity of 37% with 43% increase in peak deformation with respect to control column and showing an increase of 8% stiffness than C-LW-20. C-LW-50 column (with 50 mm ECC wrap) showed a 13% decrease in peak stiffness than the column with 30 mm thick ECC wrap. The load (peak) carrying capacity increased by 29% with 53% of increased deformation than the control column. The SCC control cylindrical column (C-SC) without any ECC wrap had a peak load of approximately 743 kN with axial displacement of 3.61 mm. Cylindrical column C-SC-20 (with 20 mm ECC wrap) did not attain the peak load of the control column which can be due to the problem associated with segregation, improper casting or handling during construction. Cylindrical C-SC30 (with 30 mm ECC wrap) showed increased peak stiffness of 23% than the control column with increased load capacity of 23% and same peak deformation as the control column. Cylindrical CSC-50 (with 50 mm ECC wrap) had decreased stiffness of 30% than the column C-SC-30 and showed similar stiffness as the control column. The load carrying capacity increased by 12% with considerable increased deformation of 31% compared to control column. Table 4.2: Summary of test results of cylindrical column specimens

4.2.3 Failure mode and cracking behavior Control SCC and LWSCC core cylindrical column specimens split at peak load showing brittle behavior (Fig. 4.5). The ultimate load for control LWSCC column was 585 kN compared to 743 kN of its SCC counterpart (Table 4.2). Generally, for ECC wrapped LWSCC and SCC cylindrical columns, the crack initiated with a pop sound starting from the top of the cylinder and mostly travelled vertically (Fig. 4.3). All the cylinders showed vertical (tensile) crack, however SCC SSC-20 column showed inclined cracking with low load carrying capacity. For confined LWSCC cylindrical columns, the initial cracking load was higher than the ultimate load of core-control cylindrical column. Initial cracking load of confined SCC cylindrical columns were lower than the ultimate load of the core. The results and observations are tabulated in Table 4.2.

Fig. 4.4: Testing of cylindrical columns showing crack patterns and failure modes 4.2.4 Load-strain behavior Load vs hoop strain response of ECC cylindrical column C-EC is shown in Fig. 4.5a. The development of hoop strain is initially slow to 200 kN load and increased to the failure load of 878 kN with hoop strain of 0.0016. After failure load, the hoop strain increased for almost same load level indicating the ductile behavior of ECC.

Hoop strain

Fig. 4.5a: Hoop strain development in cylindrical ECC column C-EC Fig. 4.5b shows hoop strain development in LWSCC cylinders at the interface of core cylinder and outer surface of the ECC wrap. The hoop strain of LWSCC control cylindrical column C-LW at failure load of 584 kN reached 0.000348. Cylindrical column C-LW-20 at failure load of 759 kN reached interfacial hoop strain of 0.000389 which is 1.1 times higher than the hoop strain of control cylinder. The hoop strain in 20 mm thick ECC wrap was 0.001237 which is 1.3 times lower than hoop strain of ECC control cylinder at failure. Cylindrical column C-LW-30 at failure load of 801 kN reached interfacial hoop strain of 0.00060 showing 1.7 times more strain capacity than column C-LW and 1.5 times higher than column C-LW-20. The hoop strain on 30mm ECC wrap was 0.000156 which is 10.3 times lower than ECC control cylinder. Cylindrical column C-LW-50 at failure load of 754 kN reached interfacial hoop strain of 0.0033 which is 9.5 times increase in hoop strain capacity due to confinement effect and the hoop strain on the surface of 50mm thick ECC wrap was 0.000092 which is 17 times lesser that failure hoop strain of ECC control specimen. It can be inferred from these results that the confinement of core LWSCC cylindrical column increased the hoop strain capacity of the confined concrete.

Fig. 4.5b: Hoop strain development in cylindrical column between the interface (LWSCC/ECC) and outer wrap (ECC) surface Fig. 4.5c shows hoop strain development in SCC cylinders at the interface of core cylinder and outer surface of the ECC wrap. The hoop strain of SCC control cylindrical column C-SC at failure load of 744 kN reached 0.000492. Cylindrical column C-SC-20 at failure load of 629 kN reached interfacial hoop strain of 0.000553, 1.12 times higher than the control cylinder and the hoop strain on ECC wrap was 0.007712 which is 5 times higher than hoop strain on ECC wrap. Both the values of hoop strains, at interface and wrap surface, are higher than failure hoop strain of SCC and ECC control cylinders. It is also observed that the cracking pattern of C-SC-20 column ( Fig. 4.4) is different from other cylindrical specimens. Cylindrical column C-SC-30 at failure load of 911 kN reached interfacial hoop strain of 0.002434 showing 5 times increased strain capacity and with 52

Cylindrical column C-SC-50 at failure load of 834 kN reached interfacial hoop strain of 0.002939, 6 times higher than control cylinder, suggesting increased hoop strain capacity due to confinement effect. Strain gauges on ECC wrap of both C-SC-30 and C-SC-50 cylindrical columns were dislocated before the failure load due to crack propagation.

Fig. 4.5c: Hoop strain development in cylindrical column between the interface (SCC/ECC) and outer wrap (ECC) surface 4.2.5 Ductility Index Cylindrical columns with ECC wrapping showed significant increase in strain-based ductility and deformation capacity which is expressed by Ductility Index (DI). DI shows the extent of deformation of column before failure. Strain based DI(Strain) is expressed as axial strain at 85% (85) 53

of peak load on descending branch of stress-strain curve to strain at peak load ( p) as per Eq. 4.1. Deformation based DI(Deformation) is expressed as deformation at 85% (85) of peak load on ascending or descending branch of load-deformation curve to deformation at peak load ( p) as per Eq. 4.2. DI(Strain) = 85 (post-peak)/ p DI(Deformation) = p/85 (pre-peak) (4.1) (4.2)

Strain based ductility index (DI(Strain)) was calculated based on (4.1) from load-strain curves shown in Fig. 4.6a. Ductility index of LWSCC and SCC cylinders increased with the increase of ECC wrap thickness. For wrap thickness of 20 mm to 50 mm, ductility index increased from 3 to 15 which is shown in Table 4.3. Fig. 4.6b shows the parameters for ductility index for specimens CLW-50 and C-SC-50. In general, DI(Strain) increased with the increase of ECC wrap thickness. Deformation base ductility was calculated based on Eq. 4.2 from load-deformation curves shown in Fig. 4.3. DI(Deformation) did not show significant increase in ductility for cylindrical columns (Table 4.3).

Fig. 4.6b: Ductility Index (strain based) for cylindrical columns 4.2.6 Energy absorption capacity Energy absorbed by cylindrical columns are given in Table 4.3. The area covered by loaddeformation curve up to the ultimate/peak load of each specimen was defined as the amount of energy absorbed. Fig. 4.7 shows the area under the peak load for C-LW-50 specimen for typical energy calculation. The Energy Ratio was defined as increase in energy absorption capacity with respect to control cylindrical column. The energy ratio for LWSCC cylindrical column 20 mm thick ECC wrap was 1.52, 30 mm thick ECC wrap was 1.85 and 50 mm thick ECC wrap was 1.92, showing increase in energy absorption capacity when thickness of wrap was increased. SCC cylindrical column absorbed more energy with increasing thickness of ECC wrap. The energy 55

ratio for SCC cylindrical column with 20 mm thick ECC wrap was 1.08, 30 mm thick ECC wrap was 1.22 and 50 mm thick ECC wrap was 1.25. SCC cylindrical columns showed higher energy absorbing capacity than LWSCC counter part due to higher load resisting capacity.

ECC under Type A loading SCC and LWSCC columns were confined with ECC wrap thickness of 10 mm, 15 mm and 20 mm and subjected to Type-A loading through whole cross-sectional area (both core and wrap). Results are explained in terms of load-deformation responses, load-strain developments, failure modes, ductility and energy absorbing capacity.

4.3.1 Load vs. deformation behavior Load-deformation responses of square LWSCC columns are shown in Fig. 4.8a and the results are summarized in Table 4.4. The core LWSCC column (S-LW) without any ECC wrap (control column) had a peak load of approximately 383 kN with axial displacement of 4.3 mm showing peak stiffness of 89 kN/mm. Column S-LW-20 (with 20 mm ECC wrap) sustained a peak load of 1020 kN load with axial deformation of 4.6 mm. It showed 166% increase in load carrying capacity and 7% increase in deformation at peak load compared to control column with increase of peak stiffness of 149% . Column S-LW-25 (with 25 mm ECC wrap) exhibited increased load carrying capacity of approximately 152% with 1% decrease in peak deformation than control column with increase of stiffness of 156%. The column S-LW-30 (with 30 mm ECC wrap) showed increased load carrying capacity of 218% with decreased deformation of 3% than control column showing increased stiffness of 203%. In general, increased ECC wrap thickness increased load carrying capacity and decreased deformation capability (increased stiffness) of columns. Load-deformation curves for reinforced untied SCC columns without (control column) and with ECC wrap are compared in Fig. 4.8b and results are summarized in Table 4.4. The SCC control column (S-SC) without any wrap had a peak load of about 870 kN with axial displacement of 3.84 mm with resulting peak stiffness of 227 kN/mm. Column S-SC-10 (with 10 mm ECC wrap) exhibited a peak load of 1398 kN showing 61% increase in load carrying capacity and 45% increase in peak deformation than control column with increased stiffness of 11% with respect to control column. S-SC-15 (with 15 mm ECC wrap) achieved a peak load of 1317 kN showing 51% and 32% higher peak load and deformation than the control column. The increase in stiffness of column S-SC-15 was 15%. Column S-SC-20 (with 20 mm ECC wrap) attained the highest peak load of 1424 kN with peak deformation of 5.08 mm showing 64% and 32% higher peak load and peak deformation compared to control column with increased stiffness of 23%.

As the compression load increased, crushing of concrete at the loading zone was observed. The crack generally propagated vertically downward from loading zone (Fig. 4.9). The crack initiated at lower load level in LWSCC columns compared to SCC columns as shown in Table 4.4. Two different types of failure mode were identified under axial compression loading. One of the failure was indicated by vertical cracks on the surface of wrap and another type of failure was indicated by combination of vertical and inclined cracks due to shear resulting from bond stress between ECC wrap and confined concrete (Fig. 4.9).

For columns S-LW, S-SC, S-SC-10 and S-SC-15, strain-based ductility could not be computed due to strain gauge failure (Table 4.5). Ductility based on deformation (DI(Deformation)) calculated with load-deformation curve showed little improvement in ductility.

Energy absorbing capacity increased with the increase of ECC wrap thickness for both reinforced untied square columns. The energy absorbed by LWSCC columns S-LW-20 was 2.32, S-LW-25 was 1.86 and S-LW-30 was 2.53 times more than that of LWSCC control column. The energy absorbed by SCC columns S-SC-10 was 2.64, S-SC-15 was 1.72 and S-SC-20 was 1.65 times higher than that of SCC control column.

Reinforced tied square columns with varying thickness of ECC wrap -Type B loading

Square LWSCC columns with varying ECC wrap thickness of 20 mm, 30 mm and 50 mm in addition to tied SCC column with ECC wrap thickness of 50 mm having same longitudinal and tie reinforcement were tested by applying axial load through the LWSCC/SCC core until failure. 4.4.1 Axial Load vs deformation behavior Load-deformation responses for LWSCC/SCC columns are shown in Fig. 4.12 and the results are summarized in Table 4.6. Crack development was indicated by the formation of kinks. The LWSCC control column (S-LW-T) without any wrap had a peak load of approximately 566 kN with axial displacement of 3.92 mm. The peak stiffness of column S-LW-T was 144 kN/mm. Column S-LW-20T (with 20 mm ECC wrap) sustained a peak load of 804 kN with axial deformation of 3.12 mm. It showed 42% increase in peak load carrying capacity with 20% decrease in peak deformation compared to the control column with increased stiffness of 79% than control column. Column S-LW-30T (with 30 mm ECC wrap) sustained a peak load of 881 kN and 1.53 mm peak deformation with 56% higher load and 61% decrease in deformation compared to control column with increased stiffness of 300%. Column S-LW-50T (with 50 mm ECC wrap) had peak load carrying capacity of 986 kN with 74% increase and 2.89 mm peak deformation with 26% decrease compared to control columns. The increase in peak stiffness for the column S-LW-50T was 137%. Overall, peak load/strength of the columns increased with the increase of ECC wrap thickness while causing increase in stiffness. The SCC core column (S-SC-T) without any ECC wrap (control) had a peak load of about 709 kN with axial displacement of 3.88 mm (Fig. 4.12 and Table 4.6) resulting peak stiffness of 183 kN/mm. Column S-SC-50T (with 50 mm ECC wrap) with peak load capacity of 1293 kN with 2.56 mm deformation showing about 82% increase in load carrying capacity and 34% lower deformation than control column (Table 4.6) and the stiffness increased by 176%. Overall, use of tie reinforcement increased the load carrying capacity of columns with or without ECC wrap with decrease in deformation. SCC tied column with ECC warp showed higher strength and lower deformation compared to its LWSCC counterpart.

Fig. 4.12: Load-deformation responses of reinforced tied columns under Type B loading 4.4.2 Failure mode and cracking behavior The first cracking loads for the tied columns are shown in Table 4.6. Tied square LWSCC columns showed that the crack initiated relatively at lower load with a "pop" sound before reaching the peak load. For tied SCC column the cracking load approached near to the peak load. Generally, most of the cracks started at the corners of the column (with narrower crack in the mid crosssection) travelling vertically up to middle third height of the column ( Fig. 4.10).

The curve reversed after failure load which can be attributed to gauge failure. Column S-LW-50T at failure load of 986.9 kN had hoop strain capacity of 0.000440, 2.7 times higher than control column and the hoop strain was 0.002449 on the ECC wrap surface.

Discussion of results

4.5.1 Influence of ECC wrap thickness on peak load and stiffness LWSCC and SCC cylindrical/square columns showed increased load capacity with increasing thickness of ECC wrap (Fig. 4.17). Peak stiffness decreased for unreinforced cylindrical columns while it increased for reinforced square columns. LWSCC and SCC unreinforced cylindrical columns (C-LW-50 and C-SC-50) with 50 mm wrap under Type B loading showed 29% and 12% increase in load carrying capacity with 16% and 14% decrease in peak stiffness, respectively compared to control columns. Untied reinforced LWSCC and SCC square columns (S-LW-20 and S-SC-20) with 20 mm wrap under Type A loading showed 166% and 64% increase in load carrying capacity with peak increase of peak stiffness of 148% and 24%, respectively. Tied reinforced LWSCC and SCC columns (S-LW-50T and S-SC-50T) with 50 mm wrap under Type B loading showed 74% and 82% increase in peak load with increase of peak stiffness of 137% and 177%, respectively (Tables 4.2, 4.4 and 4.7) with respect to their unwrapped control columns.

Load carrying capacity increased with increasing t/D and t/b ratios for cylindrical and square columns. Cylindrical SCC column (S-SC-20) showed decreased strength which might be due to deficiency in casting and curing process. SCC columns showed higher peak load capacity than LWSCC columns due to the higher compressive strength of 42 MPa compared to LWSCC compressive strength of 33 MPa.

Untied reinforced SCC column (S-SC-20) with 20 mm thick ECC wrap sustained 131 kN more load than tied reinforced SCC square column (S-SC-50T) with 50 mm thick ECC wrap.

Fig. 4.21: Influence of Type A and Type B loading on peak load Fig. 4.21 shows the influence of wrap on energy absorption in terms of energy ratio defined as the ratio of energy absorbed by wrapped column to the energy absorbed by unwrapped control column. Tables 4.3, 4.5 and 4.7 show energy ratio for cylindrical and square columns. There was an increase of 53% energy ratio in LWSCC non-reinforced cylindrical column compared to its SCC counterpart with 50 mm thick ECC wrap. Untied reinforced LWSCC square column showed 41% increase in energy ratio than its SCC counterpart with 20mm thick ECC wrap. However, for tied reinforced square columns, the energy ratio for SCC column was 13% more than that of its LWSCC counterpart with 50 mm thick ECC wrap. Based on these observation, untied LWSCC column benefitted more from ECC wrap than tied columns. 72

Tables 4.3, 4.5 and 4.7 shows ductility index (DI) for cylindrical and square columns. There is no significant ductility enhancement based on ascending branch of load-deformation curve. However, for most of the cases, pre-peak ductility seemed to be increased with the increase of t/D or t/b ratio.

In this chapter, load-deflection responses of columns, crack formation and propagation, ductility, energy absorption capacity, ultimate load, failure modes, ECC wrapping characterstics, material/geometric properties and stress-strain developments of LWSCC/SCC columns were described based on the experimental results. LWSCC/SCC columns showed increased load carrying capacity with increasing ECC thickness and increased energy absorption capacity. Almost all the cracks developed spread vertically generating from loading zone. The ductility did not increase significantly for all wrapping thickness expect 50mm thick ECC wrap. Columns under Type A loading showed more load carrying capacity than columns under Type B loading. Wrapping of columns increased the stiffness of columns instead of ductility for thinner section of the wrap, however for thick ECC wrap, the ductility increased.

CHAPTER FIVE ANALYTICAL AND NUMERICAL ANALYSES OF COLUMNS WITH ECC CONFINEMENT 5.1 Introduction This Chapter describes analytical and numerical analyses in conjunction with experimental results of lightweight self-consolidating concrete (LWSCC) and self-consolidating concrete (SCC) unreinforced cylindrical and longitudinally reinforced (with and without ties) square columns with engineered cementitious composite (ECC) wrapping or confinement. 5.2 Quantification for effective confinement and compressive strength models for

confined concrete The model developed by Mander et al. (1988) can be used to calculate the confined compressive strength of concrete (f'cc):
 

= -1.254 + 2.254 1 +

.

(5.1)

The Richart et al. (1929) model can also be used to calculate the confined compressive strength of concrete (f'cc):
 

= 1 + 4.1



(5.2)

where f'l is the effective passive confining stress and f'c is the unconfined compressive strength of concrete. Once f'l is calculated, the confined compressive strength of concrete can be calculated. f'l can be due to: (a) tie reinforcements in reinforced concrete column, (b) wrapping in column and (c) combined tie reinforcement and wrapping in column. As per Mander et al. (1988), the effective confinement stress, ( fl') for square column (in x and y directions) with wrapping of thickness (t) as shown in Fig. 5.1 and circular column with ties (Fig. 5.2), is dependent on the geometry which is defined as: For square column: (f''l) =  =

(5.3) ) is the reinforcement ratio for ties,  (= 2 )

where ke is the shape factor for the column,  (=

and for ties:  = 1 -

(5.4.2)

where b and h are sectional dimensions of column and sc is the cross-sectional area ratio of the longitudinal steel reinforcement. bt and dt are side lengths of a tie (Fig. 5.1).

Fig. 5.1: Dimensions of square reinforced tied column with wraping For circular column, confinement due to ties is (Fig. 5.2):  = The shape factor for circular ties with clear spacing "s" and diameter "d" is given by:  = where  (= ) is the reinforcement ratio for ties (5.6) (5.5)

76

For circular column with full concrete ECC wrap of "t" thickness and tensile strength fy, the shape factor equals 1, ( = 1) , so the confinement is the same as given by Richart et al. (1929) shown in Eq. 5.10. Richart et al. (1929) derived lateral stress (f'l) in the confined concrete of axially loaded reinforced circular columns with evenly spaced lateral ties (tie spacing of s) shown in Fig. 5.2. Let Ac be the sectional area of the concrete between the ties, d is the diameter of the concrete, fy is the yield strength of the tie and As is the sectional area of the tie.

Ratio of volume of ties to the volume of confined section ( h.) can be defined as:

(5.8)

Substituting h from Eq. 5.7 in Eq. 5.8:
  = 2 ;  =  .  /2

(5.9)

Similarly, for axially loaded circular columns ( Fig. 5.2) with ECC wrap (of thickness `t') confinement, lateral stress (f'l) in the confined concrete can be derived as:  = 2 /d (5.10)

77

where b is the outer radius, a is the inner radius (a = d/2) as per Fig. 5.2. Total confinement effect on concrete is the summation of confinements provided by the ties and the concrete wrap. Richart et al. (1929) model can be used to derive lateral stress (f'l) for quantification of confinement by transforming square column into equivalent circular column of diameter  +  . The confinement in terms of lateral stress (f'l) produced by different thickness of ECC wrap in tested non-reinforced cylindrical and reinforced (tied or non-tied) square columns using Mander (1988) and Richart (1929) models are given in Table 5.1. Detailed calculations are provided in the Appendix A. Eqs. 5.3 and 5.10 show that the confining stress (f'l) is proportional to t/D ratio for cylindrical column and t/b ratio for square column. Higher confining stress imparts more confined strength to the core concrete which is also observed from experimental results shown in chapter four ( Fig. 4.18) Table 5.1: Confinement quantification in terms of lateral stress ( f'l) for tested columns

Overall, an increase in ECC wrap thickness increased confinement stress in both cylindrical and 80 (5.10)

square columns. Addition of tie bars also significantly increased the confinement stress. Confining effect is also higher in circular columns compared to their square counterparts. Since the analytical expression for confinement is only related to yield strength of wrap and its geometry, this expression does not deal with the interaction between core concrete and the wrap. 5.3 Strength increase due to confinement

5.3.1 Analytical Method The confined compressive strength of core concrete based on Eq. 5.1 by Mander et al. (1988) and Eq. 5.2 by Richart et al. (1929) are summarized in Table 5.2. Sample calculations are provided. The strength prediction by Mander's model is higher than predicted by Richart's model as shown in Table 5.2. Strength increase in cylindrical columns were less than that of reinforced tied square column counterparts as predicted by the models.

Compressive loads carried by each component are: Pw = w*Aw =   Pc = c*Ac =   Ps = s*As =   (5.17) Table 5.3 summarizes load shared by each of the column components of reinforced untied square columns subjected to Type A loading (sample calculations are provided). It can be noted that the load contributions of 20 mm thick ECC wrap were 20.64% and 16.57% for LWSCC and SCC column, respectively. For every 5 mm thickness increase of ECC wrap, the load contribution of the wrap was increased by 3% to 4%. It was also observed that strength increased with increase of ECC wrap thickness up to 30mm but beyond 30 mm, strength started to decrease. The higher load capacity for Type A loading can be attributed to the composite action of column rather than confining action because passive confinement is provided by tensile strength of the wrap whereas composite action is due to the compressive strength. The results are presented in Table 5.3. It is interesting to note that the LWSCC columns were more benefitted by the ECC wrapping than their SCC counterparts in Type A loading as evident from the maximum 27.75% load contribution of ECC wrap in LWSCC columns compared to maximum 16.57% in their SCC counterparts.

ECC wrap failed in tension due to radial expansion of core concrete. 5.3.2.3 Non-reinforced cylindrical columns with wrap The strength gain in these columns was due to confinement provided by ECC wrap. ECC wrap failed in tension due to radial expansion of core concrete as confirmed from the experiment. Table 5.4 shows the strength gain in such cylindrical columns due to varying thickness of ECC wrap. The strength increase in SCC cylindrical columns was found to be lower than LWSCC cylindrical columns. The strength gain of 29.78% ,37.05% and 28.99% were observed in LWSCC columns with 20 mm (C-LW-20), 30 mm (C-LW-30) and 50 mm (C-LW-50) thick ECC wrap, respectively compared to their control counterpart without ECC wrap. Strength increase in cylindrical SCC column C-SC-30 was 22.59% and C-SC-50 was 12.22%. Table 5.4: Type B loading - Load increment due to ECC wrap in non-reinforced cylindrical columns

Longitudinally reinforced tied square columns with wrap Reinforced tied square column showed good strength enhancement under Type B loading ( Table 5.5). LWSCC column (S-LW-50T) strength gain was higher than its SCC counterpart (S-SC-50T). LWSCC column showed increased strength enhancement with increased thickness of ECC wrap. Column S-LW-20T showed 42.26% increase, column S-LW-30T strength increased by 55.78% and the column S-LW-50T experienced increased strength of 74.48%.

The higher load capacity for Type A loading can be attributed to composite action of column rather than confining action because passive confinement is provided by tensile strength of the wrap whereas composite action is due to compressive strength of column components as shown in Tables 5.3 to 5.5. 5.3.3 Axial capacity of column based on CSA (2012) CSA - S806 (2012), section 11.4.2.5 gives confined compressive strength of concrete ( f'cc) to determine the axial capacity of a confined column jacketed with fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) sheet.

Table 5.6c shows that the confined strength and the axial capacity of columns increased with increasing thickness of ECC wrap. 5.3.4 Finite element modelling of columns Commercially available software "Abaqus" was used to calculate the peak axial stress of columns from finite element models. Concrete Damage Plasticity (CDP) Model was used for the modelling. Material parameters were obtained from the experiments done in the laboratory. Bond (shear) stress between the interface of two concretes (core and wrap) was obtained from experiment. Coefficient of friction was assigned as suggested by PCI Handbook (2004).

5.3.4.1 Details of FE modelling The parts of FE model consisted of 3D deformable concrete wrap and core concrete whereas rebars and ties were modeled as a wire. Cylindrical concrete columns were modeled using half symmetry. Linear hexahedron type C3D8R for concrete and linear line type B31 for steel were used as elements for meshing. Concrete mechanical properties were derived from experimental tests done in the laboratory (Fig. 4.1). Concrete damage plasticity parameters were assigned as default values with eccentricity of 0.1, initial equibiaxial compressive yield stress to initial uniaxial compressive yield stress (fb0/fc0) as 1.16, ratio of second stress invariant (K) as 1.16 and viscosity parameter as 0. Dilation angle for SCC was taken as 35 o and ECC/LWSCC as 30o as SCC has higher stiffness 90

than ECC/LWSCC - the model was not found sensitive to dilation angle. Yield strength of concrete was taken as the value when the stress strain curve started to deviate from straight line before reaching peak stress. Tensile behavior was derived from fracture and splitting tests. The sections were assembled according to their geometric configuration to represent the actual specimen. Fig. 5.4 shows the assembly for tied reinforced column.

Fig. 5.3: Creating Assembly from Parts Two steps using Abaqus Implicit were created for analysis by default. According to PCI Handbook (2004), coefficient of friction between concrete and concrete is 0.6. The value of  is suggested as 0.75 for LWSCC and 1.0 for normal concrete. The tangential behavior between concrete wrap and core was defined by Penalty using coefficient of friction for LWSCC as 0.45 and SCC as 0.6. Normal contact was defined as hard contact. Shear/bond stress between two concretes were obtained from laboratory test as shown in Table 5.7. The shear stress obtained from slant shear test is very high, so shear values were taken from bond test ( Table 5.7). Reinforcement bars were embedded in core concrete. Symmetry was used to facilitate the computation for column model. Loads were applied as a displacement (Fig. 5.4) in displacement control analysis.

Fig. 5.4: Load and half-symmetry of column for analysis 5.3.4.2 Analysis of FE results The contour maps showing distribution of axial stress (s33) for non-reinforced cylindrical columns (C-LW-50 and C-SC-50), reinforced untied column (S-LW-20) and reinforced tied columns (SLW-50T and S-SC-50T) at different load levels of 50%, 75% and 95% of peak load are presented in Figs. 5.5 to 5.9. The axial stress development at different load levels in a chosen element (as indicated in Figures) is also shown in Figs. 5.5 to 5.9. When Type B load is applied in terms of 50%, 75% and 95% of experimental peak load, the maximum axial stress in cylindrical column CLW-50 core were 23 MPa, 34 MPa and 43 MPa (compression), respectively compared to 0.156 MPa, 0.210 MPa and 0.198 MPa (tension) in ECC wrap. Similarly, for C-SC-50 cylindrical column the maximum axial stress in the core were 26 MPa, 39 MPa and 50 MPa (compression), respectively compared to 0.208 MPa, 0.273 MPa and 0.289 MPa (tension) in ECC wrap.

Elemental stress in top surface of LWSCC core increases from 50% to 75% of peak load and there is reduction in stress from 75% to 95% of peak load in the element due to transfer of stress to the longitudinal reinforcement bar from highly stressed concrete. As the column is loaded from the core only, ECC wrap experiences hoop (tensile) stress only. The maximum axial (compressive) stress for S-LW50T square column in the core were 39 MPa, 57 MPa and 40 MPa (compression) compared to 0.111 MPa, 0.295 MPa and 2.233 MPa (tension) in ECC wrap subjected to tensile stress. Similarly for S-SC-50T cylindrical column, the maximum axial (compressive) stress in the core were 46 MPa, 72 MPa and 54 MPa compared to 0.129 MPa, 0.316 MPa and 1.125 MPa (tensile stress) in ECC wrap.

Elemental axial stress at top surface of LWSCC core increased up to 75% of peak load and decreased from 75% to 95% of peak load due to transfer of stress to longitudinal reinforcement bar from highly stressed concrete. The maximum axial (compressive) stress in the core were 41.7 MPa, 51.1 MPa and 47.5 MPa (compression) at 50%, 75% and 95% of peak load, respectively. The difference in behavior between Type A and Type B loading is evident from. Type A loading caused ECC wrap to share axial compressive load and hence caused separation of ECC wrap from core with buckling of warp as can be seen in Fig. 5.9 (which were not observed in Type B loading). The quantification of strength increase due to confinement was done based on peak axial stress developed in an element at the top surface of the concrete core from FE analysis. Fig. 5.10 shows axial stress-strain responses given by cylindrical and square SCC/LWSCC core column due to 50 mm ECC wrap. Table 5.8 summarizes the peak axial stress of cylindrical and square columns. FEM analysis showed that cylindrical columns had developed higher peak axial stress than square columns signifying more confining effect. The peak axial stress/strength in the concrete core increased with the increase of the thickness of the ECC wrap for both cylindrical and square columns as observed in experiments. 97

Table 5.12 presents the experimental and code-based axial load capacities of cylindrical and square columns. For non-reinforced cylindrical columns under Type B loading (as shown in Table 5.12 code is conservative (Pexp/Pcode ranges between 1.04 and 1.49 with a mean value 1.28) and more conservative for columns with less thick ECC wrap. Code is also found generally conservative for tied or untied reinforced square columns as the ratio ranges between 0.87 and 1.38 with a mean value of 1.12 for untied and between 1.02 and 1.31 with a mean value of 1.14 for tied columns).

Summary

The confining effect of LWSCC and SCC columns with ECC wrapping was studied based on Codes, experiments, existing equations (by Mander and Richart) and finite element models. Code based analysis (CSA-S806 -2012) which was developed for FRP showed conservative predictions of axial load capacity and conservativeness increase with increasing thickness of ECC wrap.

CHAPTER SIX CONCLUSIONS 6.1 General

This research studied the axial load behavior of confined lightweight self-consolidating concrete (LWSCC) and self-consolidating concrete (SCC) columns with engineered cementitious composite (ECC) wrap. The variables used were concrete types for core columns (LWSCC and SCC), geometry of columns (cylindrical and square), non-reinforced and reinforced columns, reinforced tied and untied columns, types of loading (Type A: load applied through both core and wrap and Type B: load applied through core only) and thickness of ECC wrap. The following conclusions are drawn from experimental, analytical and finite element (FE) investigations:   LWSCC/SCC columns showed increased axial load carrying and energy absorption capacities with the increase of ECC warp thickness. The ductility of columns did not generally increase significantly with the increase of ECC wrap, however, the highest ECC wrap thickness of 50 mm showed increase in ductility. ECC wrapping of columns increased the stiffness instead of ductility for thinner the wrap, however for thick ECC wrap, the ductility increased. There was an indication that confinement effect increased only up to some extent of thickness of the wrap. More experimental verification is needed.  Type A loaded columns showed more load axial carrying capacity than columns under Type B loading. Type A loading caused the column to carry load by composite action whereas Type B loading showed the increased capacity of column due to confinement.  Confinement of non-reinforced LWSCC/SCC core in cylindrical columns increased the hoop strain capacity of the confined concrete. LWSCC columns were more benefitted in terms of confinement (based on confined concrete strength and load carrying capacity enhancement) than their SCC counterparts.  LWSCC columns under Type B loading were more benefitted by the ECC wrapping than their SCC counterparts in Type A loading as evident from the maximum 27.75% load contribution of ECC wrap in LWSCC columns compared to maximum 16.57% in their SCC counterparts.

102



Existing theoretical equations and FE models were good in predicting the confined concrete strength and axial strength of both LWSCC/SCC columns with ECC wrapping. However, code based equations were conservative in predicting axial strength of columns with increasing thickness of ECC wrap.

6.2    

Recommendations for future research More experiment is required on each variable to generalize the effect of confinement on core column. Behavior of ECC confinement under elevated temperature needs to be studied. The effect of bonding between core and wrap on confinement needs to be evaluated for deriving proper model for confinement. The performance of models for confinement and strength calculations using existing equations needs to be further investigated based on more experimental results and FE modelling.  Economy of ECC wrap to produce effective confinement needs to be studied.
