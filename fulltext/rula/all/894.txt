ABSTRACT

This thesis project focuses on reviewing the state-of-the-arts work in chatter research, identifying a reliable mechanistic dynamic cutting force model for orthogonal cutting operations when machining slender shafts, carrying out a series of experiments on uniform and stepped workpiece, and validating the theoretical predictions of chatter onset conditions against experimental results.
In this thesis, the theoretical results were

obtained from a computer code, CHATTER, in which the flexible workpiece is considered as a spinning Timoshenko beam and modeled using the finite element method. The chatter onset conditions are obtained for a uniform specimen and a stepped specimen by running the CHATTER code under various operating conditions

An experimental setup was established in the Machine Shop, Department of Mechanical, Aerospace and Industrial Engineering, to investigate chatter in turning. Chatter frequencies and locations of occurrence of chatter were obtained using a B&K frequency analyzer for a total of nine specimens under different cutting operations. Results are in good agreement with the theoretical results.

Chapter 1 OVERVIEW OF CHATTER RESEARCH

1.1

Introduction

A metal cutting process involves the continuous removal of material from the workpiece in the form of chips by feeding the cutting tool. During a single point cutting process on a lathe, the heterogeneity of workpiece material, the run-out or misalignment of the workpiece may cause occasional disturbances to the cutting process and may result in vibration of the workpiece with respect to the cutting tool. If the cutting process is stable, the resulting vibration dies out quickly because of damping. However, under certain conditions, the magnitude of the ensuing vibration becomes ever increasing. phenomenon is termed as chatter. This

One important aspect of chatter is that it occurs suddenly. After the onset, it is almost immediately developed into full scale and disastrous vibration as shown in Figure 1.1As a result, significant damage may occur before any action is taken. Figure 1.2 and figure 1.3 illustrate the effect of chatter on w.orkpiece surface finish. Chatter can have an adverse effect on part dimensional accuracy and the cutting tool life.

Figure 1.2 Chatter in turning (Tulsty and Koenigsberger, machine tool structure)

Figure 1.3 A hollow cylinder after chatter (Stephen, 1999) Various types of vibrations may be encountered during turning. Machining vibrations are usually classified into the following four main categories:
i.

Free vibration Free vibration is initiated by some impact or shock. This vibration usually decays because of the presence of damping in the system.

3

ii.

Non-cutting induced forced vibration
This type of forced vibration is caused by a source other than cutting, such as unbalance in the machine tool drive.

iii.

Cutting-induced forced vibration
This type of forced vibration is initiated by the inherent periodicity in the cutting process, such as the material build-up near the tool edge and discontinuity of chips.

iv.

Self exited vibration
The self-excited vibration, or chatter, is further classified into regenerative chatter (one in which there is overlap between successive cut) and non-regenerative chatter. Regenerative effect is caused by the superposition of successive cuts, where tool removes a wavy surface generated in the previous pass. Nonregenerative vibration is maintained by cutting force fluctuations that are induced by cutting tool- workpiece relative displacement of periodic nature.

The main objective of chatter analysis and experiment is to predict its onset conditions. The onset of chatter is the movement at which amplitude of vibration of workpiece with respect to the tool starts to rise rapidly during cutting. The increase in amplitude occurs because machine tool structure cannot dissipate the supply energy. If the machine tool structure dissipates the energy the system is stable otherwise system is unstable. From the point of view of energy transfer in the cutting system, the onset of chatter can be regarded as the stability threshold of the system in which the machine tool structure dissipates the energy. In this thesis, only the stability threshold in the turning process is of interest.

Turning is a single point machining process which is used to machine casting, forging, and other workpiece into cylindrical components, which require precision dimensional tolerance and good surface finish. In turning process, a workpiece rotates about its longitudinal axis on a machine tool called a lathe, as shown in Figure 1.4. A workpiece is usually clamp-supported at one end by a chuck and simply supported by a tailstock at the other end. During cutting, the chuck along with the workpiece spins at a controllable A cutting tool is mounted on a tool post, which drives

the cutting tool along the workpiece, and/or across the workpiece. A cutting tool is fed along the workpiece axis to remove material and produce the required shape. The machined surface is concentric to the axis of the workpiece. A schematic diagram of a turning process is shown in the Figure 1.5.

There are several parameters affecting the chatter onset condition in turning.

For given

workpiece (material, geometry, damping, boundary conditions), given lathe (tool structure, support, geometry, and insert), these parameters are cutting speed (or spindle spin rate), feed rate and depth of cut. Cutting speed is the rate at which cutting tool removes the material from the workpiece. Feed rate is the advancement rate of cutting tool along the workpiece per revolution. Depth of cut is the thickness of the metal removed in the radial direction.

Figure 1.5 Orthogonal cutting (Boothroyd and Knight. 1989)

To understand the mechanisms leading to chatter, it is essential to know how the dynamic cutting force components vary with the relative moment between the tool and the workpiece. The magnitudes of the cutting force components are dependent on cutting parameters, cutting tool material, tool geometry, and workpiece material. A reliable mathematical model of cutting force is needed for chatter analysis.

6

Most cutting force models assume that the cutting tool edge is sharp. In reality, tool edge cannot be sharp due to stress concentration factor. Figure 1.6 shows a cutting tool edge with small radius. Removal of the chip takes place when the cutting tool plugs into the workpiece material, and then shears off the material in the form of chips. These forces referred, as a ploughing force /p incorporating the ploughing force in the cutting force model will improve the accuracy of stability analysis.

In addition to a cutting force model, the mathematical model of the machine tool system

is needed. Depending on the stiffness of the workpiece and tool post for cutting tool, there are three types of dynamic model. If the stiffness of the workpiece is greater than the tool post, the deformation of the workpiece may be neglected, and vibration of the tool structure may be considered. If the stiffness of the tool post is greatly large than that of the workpiece, only vibration of the workpiece is considered. The third type is a coupled system consisting of both tool structure and workpiece. In last case, stiffness value of both the workpiece and tool post are comparable.

In this thesis, the tool post is considered rigid while the workpiece is flexible. Because of
the workpiece flexibility, chatter onset conditions are also influenced by the tool position along the workpiece. positions. Chatter occurs when the cutting tool lies between two critical

Most of the researcher conducted chatter analysis for uniform shaft but in reality workpiece are often non-uniform (e.g. stepped shaft). In an attempt to achieve high material removal rates, aggressive cutting conditions are often employed. Therefore, stability analysis for non-uniform workpiece becomes important.

1.2

Theory of chatter

In turning operations, chatter is a dynamic instability of the cutting process, which results

from the interaction of the dynamics of the metal cutting process and the structural dynamics of the machine tool. Under certain cutting conditions, the machine-tool and workpiece dynamical system becomes unstable, which leads to chatter. There are three mechanism associated with machining chatter namely: velocity dependent effect, regenerative effect and mode coupling (Wu and Lin, 1985).

The velocity-dependent effect is due to self-induced mechanism based on the negative slope of the cutting force variation with respect to the cutting speed (Arnold, 1946). The difference in average magnitudes of the cutting forces generated during the upward and downward strokes of tool motion causes net energy to be fed into the system, and result in dynamic instability.

8

The regenerative effect is caused by the overlap of waves in the tool motion and the work surface during successive cuts (Tobias, 1965). The modulation of uncut chip thickness creates a continuous variation in the cutting force and excites the machine structure at one of its natural frequencies. The mode coupling effect occurs when the principal natural modes of the vibratory system are closely matched. The cutting force acting in one directional axis may cause tool motion in other direction, and thus create mechanical resonance.

During a turning process, the hetrogeneity of the work piece material causes variation of cutting forces and hence result in vibration (Lin, 1990). As shown in the well-known work by
Merr~tt

(1965), a metal cutting system in which regenerative chatter is possible

is analogous to feedback control system. In most cases of practical interest, chatter observed in a turning operation is due to the regenerative effect (Rao and Shin, 1998). As the tool cuts a surface, the undulations generated in the previous revolution sustain the tool workpiece vibration, which is coupled with the cutting force. Some external perturbations or a hard spot in the workpiece material causes initial variation in cutting forces and results in vibration of the dynamic system. The vibration leaves a wavy tool path on the workpiece surface as shown in Figure 1.7. This wavy surface will affect subsequent chip thickness as a result variation in cutting force. Because of this uneven chip thickness, the system vibrates. If the magnitude of this vibration does not die out, the system becomes unstable. This phenomenon is known as the regenerative chatter.

9

The overlap between successive cut occurs as shown in Figure 1.8. This overlapping depends on feed rate. This overlap factor is introduced to account for the effect. As shown in Figure 1.9, the overlap factor is zero if previously machined surface does not affect the present cut for very large feed rate. The overlap factor is between zero and unity in turning operation (Kato and Marui, 1974)

Cutting process model

Metal removal process using a lathe is very popular in metal cutting industry. Spinning energy of work piece and feeding energy of cutting tool interact at the cutting region. As a result of this interaction, cutting force is produced. The cutting force is influenced by many parameters such as, feed rate of cutting tool, spin rate of workpiece, depth of cut, geometry of cutting tool (e.g. approach angle, rake angle) and hardness of workpiece material.

Figure 1.10 illustrates common terminology used in describing a turning process. Many researchers have correlated various cutting parameters to formulate a cutting force model. Stephenson and Agapiou (1996) and Devries (1992) used the early work done of Merchant (1944, 1945) to model the cutting force. Merchant's model was based on the concept of a steady process in which a chip of metal is produced by shearing a strip of uncut metal continuously and uniformly, and the deformation of chip takes place along the shear plane. There are two types of cutting based on approach angle, oblique and orthogonal. In oblique cutting, the approach angle is less then 90° while in orthogonal

II

cutting, the approach angle is 900 · In this thesis, only orthogonal cutting process is studied. Figure 1.11 illustrates an orthogonal cutting process in which uncut chip comes up to the tool rake face and leaves tangentially to the rake plane with a new thickness. Width of the chip is assumed to be constant throughout the process, and neither face of the metal being cut is supported.

Figure 1.10 Cutting terminology (Boothroyd, 1975)

At the tool-workpiece zone, the cutting force is divided in three components as shown in the Figure 1.11. These components are termed as the radial force component, tangential force component, and axial force component. The radial force component, acting in radial direction, tends to push the tool away from the workpiece. The tangential force component acting on the rake plane is the main cutting force. This force component tends

12

to push the tool downward. The axial force component, acting in the cutting direction, is also known as the feed force (Trent, 1991; Oxley, 1989)

Many researchers (Trent, 1991; Oxley, 1989) have attempted to improve the earlier model developed by Merchant. They included frictional behavior on tool rake face, work hardening and high strain rate and high temperature.

In the longitudinal turning process, this is perhaps the most common turning in actual practice, the cutting tool moves along the workpiece in longitudinal direction. As tool moves along the workpiece the structural characteristic of the system changes as the cutting progresses (Lu and Kalmecki, 1990). As a result, the system characteristics change, and so does the stability of the cutting process.

The primary reason for studying chatter is to eliminate at the early stage when the amplitude of vibration is very small. It is assumed that the cutting force is proportional to the cross section area of the chip. The simplest expression is that the cutting force is proportional to the instantaneous depth of cutting width.

1.4

Ploughing force

In a dynamic cutting system forces may be conveniently divided into two major components: cutting forces exerting on tool rake face and ploughing forcing applying on

14

tool nose region (Wu and Liu, 1985). Most of the Hi-Tech cutting tools (carbide inserts) have a nose radius. Because of this nose radius, when tool approaches workpiece, it penetrates into it. This penetrating force is known as ploughing force. Further more, build-up edge phenomenon will make large effective cutting edge. Wu (1988, 1989) developed a comprehensive ploughing force model based on the principles of cutting mechanics. It takes into account the fluctuation of the mean frictional coefficient on the tool chip interface, as well as the normal hydrostatic pressure distribution and the shear flow stress along the primary plastic deformation zone. Results predicted using this model show a good agreement with the experimental determined critical width of cut.

Cook (1959) developed a cutting force model in which, if tool motion is restricted to small amplitude of vibration, the ploughing force on the tool nose region is found to be substantially independent of the uncut chip thickness, and the magnitude of the force is proportional to the penetration rate. Shwky and Elbestawi (1997) decomposed the ploughing force into static and dynamic components. In their model, damping is predicted by tracking the dynamic ploughed volume resulting from the interactions with machined surface undulations.

Wu and Liu (1985) have developed dynamic cutting force model considering two degree of freedom spring mass damper system. They have included ploughing force applying on tool nose region, but this model in stability analysis is limited.

15

1.5

Structural dynamic model

In a chatter analysis, either cutting tool structure vibrates with reference to workpiece or workpiece vibrate with reference to the cutting tool. If stiffness of workpiece considered high compared to tool structure, the tool structure may vibrate under certain conditions. On other hand, if the tool structural or support stiffness is high compared to workpiece, then workpiece may vibrate.

Study of tool structure vibration
Referring to Figure 1.4, the lathe has a cast iron bed with guide ways on it. A carriage that has feed box and slide ways for cross slide is mounted on lathe bed. A cross slide is mounted on carriage slide ways, and the tool post is mounted on cross slide. Depending on design, some tool posts have swelling arraignment to set tool at desired angle. The carriage provides the longitudinal motion to the tool while the cross slide provides the cross motion. If the stiffness of workpiece is greater than that of cutting tool, only vibration of the tool structure is considered.

Liang and Chiou (1997) studied chatter phenomenon for slender cutting tool. They considered workpiece as a rigid body. The tool structure was specially designed so that it vibrates in the feed direction. Several important facts regarding the cutting tool vibration have been reported by many researchers (Nathan and Cook, 1959; Merritt, 1965; Mauri, Ema and Kato, 1983). The cutting tools used by above authors are regarded as one or two degrees of freedom systems, which are able to deflect in the main cutting force direction or in both (radial and tangential) directions. Merritt (1965) expressed the chatter model in

16

the form of a feed back loop shown in the Figure 1.13. Analysis of this loop using feed back control theory yields a straightforward method for determining the stability limit qf a machine tool system.

Ideally all above-mentioned models are valid for a cutting tool having a long tool shank. Long tool shank is especially used in the case of boring operation, in which inside diameter of significantly long workpiece being machined, but in reality such operation nowadays carried out on a boring mill. Lathe in reality is used to machine outside diameter of workpiece in which tool shank is very small. Therefore, cutting force models with tool structure chatter are rarely used in industry. Flexible tool structure and rigid workpiece can be modeled by single degree of freedom spring/mass/damper system.

Study of workpiece vibration

As shown in Figure 1.4, one end of a workpiece is clamped by a self-centered chuck, and other end is either free or supported by a tail stock. In the work of Kaneko (1984) and

17

Klamecki (1989) the workpiece was modeled as a lumped mass with springs and dampers attached to it as shown in Figure 1.4.

As the stiffness of the cutting tool is much larger than that of the workpiece, the workpiece is the weakest element in the system. In this analysis of the structure dynamics, only the response of the workpiece is of our concern (Lu W.F., Klamecki B.E., 1990). The cutting tool can be assumed to be mounted rigidly. In their work, they considered two cases. One case deals with a workpiece supported by the chuck at one end and free at the other end. The second case deals with a workpiece supported by the chuck at one end and supported by the tail stock at the other end. The schematic diagrams of the two setups are shown in Figure 1.15. The second case is the most ideal setup in turning operations. A rotational spring is assumed to be attached at the chuck end. Support at the tail stock end is modeled as a translational spring. The dynamic cutting force is considered to be proportional to the instantaneous depth of cut. Jen and Magrab (1996) used the Euler beam theory in their stability analysis of uniform workpiece. Shawky and elbestawi

18

(1998) modeled the uniform workpiece as an Euler beam in their control system for workpiece accuracy in uniform shaft turning.

Many chatter theories have been developed to explain the causes and to predict the occurrence of chatter. Lin (1990) investigated the stability of single point cutting process using the Laplace transform and identifying the characteristic roots. Wang (2001) developed analytical models to study chatter onset of stepped shafts, but validation of theory using experiment was not found in his work.

The first phase of this project

to study and develop dynamic cutting model for

orthogonal cutting operation in global co-ordinate system. This model utilized combination of theory and experimental data. This part of the project involves a search of relevant literature to obtain background knowledge on interactions between cutting tool and workpiece. A model of chatter in orthogonal cutting for spinning Timoshenko beam

19

and dynamic cutting force model using experimental data is then developed. The stability is analyzed using the CHATTER code, written in FORTRAN. Next step is to establish experimental plan and to investigate the occurrence of chatter for different cutting conditions. This part involves selection and study of instruments to measure chatter frequency (B&K frequency analyzer) and the fundamental natural frequency of the workpiece (vibration data acquisition system and the VisualDesigner software for FFT).

Final stage covers comparisons of experimental data with analytical results.

CHATTER MODEL

2.1

Introduction

The purpose of this chapter is to review chatter models available in the literature, and come up with a model that is valid for machining slender type of flexible workpiece. For a single point cutting process, the cutter is in continuous contact with the workpiece. The chatter model describing the fundamental behavior of a cutting process should include three basic components, namely, cutting force, workpiece structural dynamics and feedback mechanism. The workpiece structural dynamics affects the dynamic cutting force through the feedback loop.

Many researchers have developed dynamic cutting process model considering tool as a flexible member (Lin, 1990). Lu and Klamecki (1990) developed a cutting process model considering the workpiece as a uniform Bernoulli-Euler beam with a rotational spring attached to the chuck end.

Yu (2000) developed a finite element model for free vibration of a spinning stepped Timoshenko beams subjected to various boundary conditions. Rao and Shin (1998) derived a mechanistic cutting force model for single-point oblique turning process.

2.2

Cutting process model

In dealing with flexural vibration of workpiece during a cutting process, it is often

necessary to conduct free vibration analysis of spinning structures. Stepped shafts shown in Figure 2.1 are commonly encountered in engineering practice. The natural frequencies

21

and mode shapes of a stepped shaft may be effectively determined using the finite element method.

Figure 2.1 Spinning stepped shaft with rotational springs

One of the main advantages of the finite element method over the analytical method is that use of the finite element method makes it possible to reduce the free vibration problem of the spinning beam to a standard eigenvalue problem for which all eigenvalues and eigenvectors may be found simultaneously. To enhance the accuracy of the computed eigenvalues and mode shapes, a three-node beam element, which allows quintic polynomials as the interpolation function for a field variable, is used (Yu, 2000). As a result, six nodal for each variable are introduced to the element displacement vector. According to the Timoshenko beam theory, a total of four variables, two lateral deflections and two bending angles are involved in free flexural vibration analysis of a spinning beam. Therefore, a total of 24 nodal variables are needed for beam element.

22

The equations of motion of a stepped beam as shown in Figure 2.1 are presented using an inertial coordinate system. The stepped beam of circular cross section is divided into Ns uniform segments. Parameters defining each segment are length, diameter, and axial coordinate of the left-most plane. In modeling the stepped beam, each segment is considered a substructure. Within a substructure, the governing equations of motion may be written as (Yu, 2000)

The mathematical formulation for global static and dynamic cutting forces will contribute to right hand side of Equation (2.1) to form complete mathematical chatter model for a

23

spinning flexible Timoshenko beam and rigid tool. A simple, static cutting force model for general oblique cutting according to Rao and Shin (1998) may be written as (2.2) where Ff and Fn are frictional and normal components of cutting forces acting on the rake face of tool; Kf and Kn are frictional and normal components of the specific cutting pressure; Ac is the cross sectional area of the undeformed chip; Kf and Kn are experimentally determined cutting pressure coefficients, dependent on the cutting tool and workpiece materials, cutting tool geometry and cutting parameters. The nominal chip cross sectional area is given by (2.3) where f is the feed rate in inch/rev in uses unit system and in mJrev in SI; ho is nominal depth of cut in mm.

Figure 2.2 illustrates the geometry of an oblique cutting tool, where i is the inclination angle (also known as the approach angle), Cs is the side cutting edge angle and normal rake angle. Axes shown in the figure represent global coordinate axes.

Figure 2.2 Cutting tool geometry and coordinate system

It has been well addressed by many researchers (e.g., Lu and Klamecki, 1990) that chatter

occurs due to the regenerative effect. Because of the regenerative effect and deflection of workpiece during cutting process, the instant depth of cut varies and causes fluctuations in cutting force components. Figure 2.3 shows a feed back loop of machining system

In the case of rigid tool and rigid tool support, chatter occurs due to variations in the dynamic cutting force and position of tool (Zc), measured from the free end. Variations in the dynamic cutting force are the result of workpiece deflection in the X and Y directions. In this analysis, the deflection in Y-axis is neglected with an estimated error of less than

25

5%. Therefore instantaneous depth of cut due to regenerative effect and deflection of workpiece at any time t at an arbitrary position of tool is

27

Waters 1995) has developed a procedure to estimate cutting force coefficients. Subsequently, Rao and Shin (1999) used same procedure to determine cutting process coefficient for cutting speed of 91m1min-122 m1min. The same workpiece material and insert are used in the thesis work, it is not necessary to duplicate the procedure to evaluate cutting coefficients. With little change in terminology, cutting coefficients curves are reproduced as shown in Figures 2.5 -2.7. Equivalent equation of polynomial is used to feed the curves in computer program along with Equation (2.7) to find out roots of equation, which will define stability boundary.

Damping ratio of 0.0045 was measured and used to determine the critical cutting conditions. Figures (2.8)-(2.11) show analytical stability lobes and chatter frequency for uniform and step shaft. Figures (2.11)-(2.12) show geometry of the uniform and step shaft. Distance Zc is measured from the free end of a workpiece.

EXPERIMENTS

3.1

Introduction

The purpose of this chapter is to explain the necessary steps for experimental verification of theoretical results from the mathematical chatter models in Chapter 2. Parameters for experiments were selected from analytical results for both stable and unstable zones. All experiments were performed using the B&K sound signal and frequency analyzer, which was set up at the Machine Shop, Ryerson University. Experimental data were plotted against analytical stability charts and conclusions were drawn. This chapter focuses on the experimental setup, testing of the setup for desired accuracy using published results, equipment used and validation of mathematical chatter models for uniform and stepped workpiece.

3.2

Experimental Setup

To record chatter frequency during a single point orthogonal cutting operation, an apparatus was prepared and tested at the Machine Shop facility. A schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in Figure 3.1. Tne workpiece is held on the three-jaw self-centered chuck. The tool holder is mounted on tool post of a lathe at pre-described overhand length suggested by manufacturer. A microphone is placed near the toolworkpiece cutting zone to catch sound waves during a cutting process. The microphone outlet was connected to a frequency analyzer, which in tum is connected to a plotter. This plotter plots a graph on the logarithmic scale of frequency vIs sound pressure level in dB. Careful study of this graph gives a chatter frequency of a workpiece being machined.

Experimental setup was tested first for a given specimen and actual onset of chatter was recorded and analyzed. Results were compared with published results (Lu and Klamecki, 1990). A good agreement was observed. The system then was considered to be working for chatter frequency measurements.

3.3

Engine Lathe

All experiments were performed on a 7.5 HP Engine lathe as shown in Figure 3.2. This is a floor mounted lathe operating at 410V and 60Hz. It has a IS-spindle speed in geometric proportion. The maximum speed is 2000 RPM; the minimum speed is 25 RPM. The feed rate varies from 0.001 in/rev to 0.04 in/rev with a total of 15 different feed rates to choose. The orthogonal cutting operation was carried out by engaging the half-nut on

35

the lead screw for a constant feed of tool against the workpiece at a selected feed rate. Depth of cut measured using dial indicator in order to nullify backlash of cross feed lead screw.

Frequency Analysis using microphone and recording

In the majority of sound and vibration investigations, the vibration of sound signals measured in the time domain are complex. More meaningful results can be provided by frequency analysis. This is especially the case when the BK2107 is used for constant

40

percentage bandwidth analysis and the analysis recorded automatically on frequency calibrated paper using the recorder.

The instrument set up for the automatic recording of constant percentage bandwidth analysis using the frequency analyzer and recorder is shown in Figure 3.4.

For the calibration purpose, a dry run without any load was taken and all the frequency was recorded in auto mode. This plot serves as a reference plot to measure chatter

41

frequency at the occurrence of chatter. During the cutting operation new plot was recorded and reference plot was superimposed to determine the actual chatter frequency. This procedure gives better measurement of chatter frequency.

3.6 Workpiece and cutting tool material and parameter calculation

AISI 4140 round steel bar was selected as the workpiece material. This chromium molybdenum alloy steel is oil hardening steel of relative high hardening ability and is among most widely used versatile machinery steels. The chromium content provides good hardness penetration and the molybdenum imparts uniformity of hardness and high strength. This grade is especially suitable for forging as it has self-scaling characteristics. It responds readily to heat treatment and is comparatively easy to machine in the heattreated condition. In the annealed condition AISI 4140 has machineability rating of 66%.

Indexable turning tool holder (CTAPR 12-3) along with uncoated carbide insert (TPG,/ 322) of C-6 grade was used for all experiments. Figure 3.5 illustrates the tool holder and uncoated carbide insert. C-6 grade is recommended for general purpose milling and machining, moderate chip loads on roughing oper.ations of moderate interruptions, also long dry cuts. This grade has good resistance to shock and greater wear resistance. Hard particles in carbide impart hardness and wear resistance properties.

Cutting parameters are function of workpiece material and cutting tool material and geometry. For AISI 4140 workpiece material and uncoated carbide inserts of 1/32" nose radius, cutting speed (V) ranges from 90m/min to 122m/min. Mathematically the cutting speed is determined from

V=llDN 1000
where D is diameter of workpiece in mm; N is spindle speed in RPM (revolution per minute). Feed rate is a function of nose radius in the case of plane turning operation, as a rule of thumb, the maximum feed rate is less than or equal to the nose radius of cutting

43

tool while the minimum depth of cut is equal to the nose radius and maximum depth of cut is equal to 2/3 rd of insert cutting edge length.

3.7

Experimental procedure

In order to verify the mathematical chatter model derived in Chapter 2 for flexible

workpiece and rigid cutting tool. Experiments were performed by cutting AISI 4140 material using uncoated carbide inserts (TPG 322) on 7.5 HP engine lathe. The boundary conditions of the workpiece at chuck end is simply supported plus two rotational springs
K t·x and K t·y while the other end of the workpiece is free. Natural frequency and the

damping ratio of the workpiece were determined experimentally using the accelerometers and the data acquisition system in the Vibrations Research Lab at Ryerson University. Figure 3.6 shows schematic layout for recording free vibration of the workpiece using an impact hammer. Figure 3.7 shows block diagram for FFT in visual designer. Figure 3.8 shows plot of natural frequency in visual designer environment.

Once the natural frequency and the damping ratio were found for the given workpiece, the next step was to run the lathe without load (cutting does not takes place!) to record the machine noise using frequency analyzer. This frequency plot serves as a reference level to measure chatter frequency during actual cutting operation, i.e., by superimposing no load frequency plot with actual cutting frequency plot one can easily detect chatter frequency.

Summary.

A procedure was established for chatter experiments. Natural frequency and damping of the workpiece were measured by mounting accelerometer at the free end of the workpiece and energy supplied to workpiece by knocking hammer on workpiece. Output signal from accelerometer processed using digital data processor. FFf analysis of input data was processed in visual designer. Chatter frequency of actual cutting operation was recorded using frequency analyzer and plotter. Cutting parameters selected from analytical stability chart. In next chapter, the experimental results are compared with theoretical results. .

4.1

Introduction

In this chapter, theoretical results from the chatter model and the CHATTER code are

compared with the experimental results. This comparison validates the theoretical model for orthogonal cutting.

4.2

Determining rotational stiffness

Although workpiece was clamped at the chuck end, it is not a truly clamped condition. This was reported in the literature and also was independently found out in this thesis project when the measured natural frequency of the workpiece was compared with the experimental natural frequency. It was concluded that chuck end is supported by a rotational springs of stiffness kt.x and kt.y as shown in Figure 2.6. Computer simulations were carried out to find the values of stiffness for 1.5" diameter AISI 4140 workpiece. Values are as shown in Table 4.1. The experiment rotational stiffness was found to be 172 KNmlrad at which the theoretical natural frequency matches the experimental natural frequency of 124 Hz.

4.3

Cutting parameters

Cutting parameters are selected from stable and unstable zone of stability charts. Table 4.2 shows various combinations of cutting parameters.

4.4

Determining chatter frequency

As shown in Figure 3.1, chatter frequency during orthogonal cutting operation recorded by frequency analyzer is plotted on a graph. ·This graph is then superimposed on reference graph (Ideal cutting graph which record no load frequency) to calculate actual chatter frequency at the occurrence of chatter. Figures 4.1- 4.6 show reference plot of frequency and cutting plots for selected cutting parameters for uniform bar. Table 4.2 shows combinations of cutting parameter for the uniform shaft.

51

Same procedure was followed to carry out experiments on stepped shaft. Figure 2.6 shows geometry of stepped shaft. Natural frequency recorded for step shaft is 131 Hz. Figures 4.7-4.18 show reference plot of frequency and cutting plot for selected cutting parameters for the stepped bar. Table 4.3 shows combinations of cutting parameter for stepped shaft.

Chapter 5

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

5.1

Conclusions

Theoretical chatter thresholds for orthogonal cutting operations were obtained for AISI 4140 material using a cutting force model and the eRATTER code. Experiments were

conducted to verify the theoretical chatter model presented in this thesis for machining flexible workpiece. The theoretical chatter frequencies and critical cutting parameters

are in agreement with the experimental data.

The chatter model presented in this thesis can be used to establish chatter free cutting conditions for various cutting operations and for different types of workpiece materials. For different materials and inserts, experiments need to be carried out to quantify the normal and tangential cutting pressure, and the chip flow angle.

5.2

Recommendations for future work

A more comprehensive cutting force model may be used in chatter analysis. For example, deflections of the workpiece in the Y direction can be considered in the cutting force model.

Precision instruments can be used to improve the accuracy of the experimental data. For example a non-contact sensor and digital processing system can be considered for use in recording deflections of the workpiece in dynamic cutting system.
