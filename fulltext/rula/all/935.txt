ABSTRACT
Serum is a complex heterogeneous matrix containing endogenous proteins with potential diagnostic value. No previously reported methods have allowed the detection of all its constituent proteins frmn a single sample. In the work described in this thesis, nonnal human serum was separated by reversed-phase or dye affinity chromatography, ultrafiltration and by extraction under various pH and salt concentrations in aqueous and organic solutions. The serum extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, MALDI and LCESI-Qq-TOF MS/MS without prior enzymatic digestion. Peptides observed as n1ultiple isotopic peaks in MS mode were correlated with known serum proteins by ProteinPilot and X!Tandem analysis of their fragn1entation spectra using the no enzyme [XIX] condition. Fragment ion masses within 0.04 Da of those predicted yielded high

confidence identifications fron1 both algorithms. Angiotensin I and [Glul] fibrinopeptide B were clearly detected in setum spiked with as little as 250 and 100 fen1tomoles respectively. Post-translational modifications of serum peptides were identified using ProteinPilot.

INTRODUCTION

Polypeptides can be rapidly analyzed by tandem mass spectrmnetry (MS/MS) following ionization by electrospray (ESI) or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) (Karas and Hillenkan1p, 1988; Fenn et al., 1989). For cmnplex protein

mixtures, electrophoresis, chron1atography, affinity purification or a combination of these separatory techniques are typically en1ployed prior to enzymatic digestion and MS/MS. Peptides are identified frotn their tandem mass spectra using heuristic or probabilistic algoritruns with in silico sequence libraries (Kapp et al., 2005). From

known protein sequences and those derived from genetic data, correlation algorithms generate lists of tnasses corresponding to peptide ions and their cmnplete fragmentation series. The search algorithms then compare predicted masses to experimental MS/MS data, reporting sequence data and the statistical relevance of the identifications. The distinct proteins from which the ions originate are thus determined. Blood serum and plasn1a are challenging matrices for protein analysis by MS/MS. They contain known disease biomarkers and tnany biomarker candidates (Dian1andis, 2007; Hortin, 2006; Letnan et al., 2008; Han et al., 2008; Plum.er et al., 2008) but the number of protein analytes they contain and chemical interference to separation and ionization hinder accurate and sensitive mass spectrometry. In addition to proteins and peptides serum and plasn1a contain lipids, nucleic acids, inorganic and s1nall organic compounds. Extensive biological modification of serum polypeptides increases the

complexity of their tandetn mass spectra, necessitating the incorporation of modificationspecific mass correlation into spectral analysis algorithms. Post-translational

1

n1odifications, tnany of which are dependent on physiological state, can abrogate signal and prevent high confidence peptide identHication.

Tandem J\tlass Spectrometry Structural complexity and diversity mnong biopolytners have spurred the creation of specialized mass spectrometry for their analysis, one of the most prevalent being MS/MS. In the absence of extremely accurate mass measurement, the identity of a

heteropolymer, a peptide for instance, may be ambiguous because many monomeric mass combinations could result in its observed mass. MS/MS begins with the isolation of a precursor fron1 an ion mixture. The

selected ion is then fragmented to produce product ions by one of a number of mechanisms. Collisionally-induced dissociation (CID), in which gas molecules are Following dissociation a mass

collided with the precursor ion is a common approach.

spectrum of the fragn1ents is collected (McLafferty and Bock11off, 1978). With the exception of leucine and isoleucine, the mass of each amino acid is unique, so each fragment ion has a limited nmnber of potential sequences. By reducing the number of amino acid combinations matching the ions of an observed fragn1entation spectlum, MS/MS allows the determination of the entire peptide sequence. Tandem mass spectra of polypeptides can be interrogated for sequence information n1anually or using automated algorithms, typically with volumes of genomic data for reference.

Ionization Technologies for the Mass Spectrometry of Non...Volatile Compounds The low volatility of polypeptides has been a barrier to their analysis by MS, which separates gas phase ions based on their mass-to-charge ratios. Two technologies employed to circumvent this problem are MALDI and ESI. Laser desorption was developed from the concept that a sufficiently rapid transfer of energy to a solid analyte will cause its sublimation before it can decompose (F enn et al., 1989). High energy particles such as atoms and ions can be used for desorption but electromagnetic radiation yields superior efficiency for large analytes (Fenn et al., 1989) . .Photoionization can be achieved on a n1etal surface alone hut MALDI en1ploys an energy-absorbing tuatrix to improve ionization. Though no mechanistic tnodel of

desorption/ionization explains aU MALDI phenomena, it is accepted that ionization results frotn interaction between tnatrix and polypeptide protons (Chang et al., 2007). Matrices such as a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) are commonly used because these tend not to fonn protein-tnatrix adducts which alter analyte mass (Beavis et al.,
1992). The desorbing laser is pulsed creating discrete packets of 1nainly singly charged

ions.
MALDI is not as sensitive to salt or detergents as ESI and can be used for proteins

ranging in mass from the smallest to those n1uch larger than 10 kDa, depending on the matrix used (Karas and Hillenkatnp, 1988; D01non and Acbersold, 2006). The transient nature of the MALDI signal is well suited to TOF instrun1ents which cannot trap and accumulate selected ions. Because laser desorption does not provide temporal resolution of the analytes, sample complexity tnust be low and offline separation is therefore essential for con1plex samples.

3

Electrospray ionization a direct interface between chron1atographic systems and the tnass analyzer and provides a continuous signaL ESI incorporates a tnetal micro or nanobore capillary tip through which the dissolved analyte is passed. The tip is

tnaintained at high electric potential in relation to the inlet of the tnass spectrometer. This potential, which is tnaintained in the kV range, charges liquid droplets emerging from the tip and directs them to the inlet. High temperature and a jacket of inert drying gas reduce droplet dian1eter through evaporation. Decreasing droplet diameter increases charge

density and destabilizes the liquid particles, causing their dissociation through the process of Coulomb fission (Cole, 2000). A succession of these collapses eventually liberates the analyte to the gas phase, with ionization caused by the initial droplet charge (Fenn et al., 1989; Cole, 2000). Electrospray yields multiply charged ions. The charge of each

analyte must therefore be determined by the relative tnasses of its isotopic envelope, requiring n1ass resolution greater than one Thomson. The contrasting properties of ESI and MALDI sources explain why they are often used in concert and tnany instrument configurations have been adapted to both.

Blood Protein Analysis by Mass Spectrometry Early examinations of blood using MALDI- Time-of-flight (TOF) demonstrated the simultaneous detection of multiple known blood polypeptides in a single sample (Oleschuck et al., 2000). Studies of peptide and protein distribution in serum using

MALDI-TOF (Hortin, 2006; Tammen et al., 2005; Marshall et al., 2004; Richter et al., 1999; MeneH et al., 2004; Yi et al., 2007), ESI-quadrupole TOF (Q-TOF) (Yi et al., 2007}, ESI-Ion trap (Zheng et al., 2006; Chan et al., 2004; Tian et al., 2007; Adkins et al.,

4

2002; Thumalai et al., 2003; Shen et al., 2005; Govoukhina et al., 2006) and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) MS (Palmblad et al., 2000) have been reported.

Quadrupole-Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Hybrid instruments incorporating two successive quadrupoles followed by an orthogonally oriented titne-of-flight tnass analyzer were shown to be wen suited for peptide analysis, requiring tninimal sample preparation and yielding high quality spectra (Verhaert et al., 2001). Qq-TOF-MS/M:S operation entails precursor ion isolation in the first quadrupole, fragmentation in the second and n1ass-to-charge measurement in the flight tube (Morris et al., 1996). The TOF tube can include an ion detector at each end and an ion mirror or reflectron, which reflects ions to the detector adjacent to the tube entrance. Both the orthogonal orientation and the reflectron hnprove resolution of the time-of-flight analyzer considerably. Qq-TOF is cmnpatible with both MALDI and ESI sources and provides 1nass resolution around 10000 full width at half maximun1 (FWHM) peak height and low PPM mass accuracy (Shevchenko et al., 1997; Loboda et al., 2000). Qq-TOF can attain subfetntomole and low femton1ole sensitivity in single MS and MS/MS tnodes respectively (Loboda et al., 2000). The high confidence spectral assignment accmnpanying high

quality Qq-TOF data rnake it ideal for the study of non-tryptic serum peptides.

ProteinPUot and X!Tandem A number of M:S/MS peptide correlation programs are available (Kapp et al., 2005). Many such programs are compatible with the FASTA file format developed for nucleic acid and protein sequence alignment (Pearson and Liptnan, 1988). X!Tandem is an open source heuristic algorithn1 for the interrogation of proteomic MS/MS data against FASTA libraries (Craig and Beavis, 2004), available online from the Global Proteome Machine (GPM) Organization at ·www.thegpm.org. Rather than calculating an1ino acid combinations that fit an observed 1n/z, X!Tandem compares observed ions to calculated m/z values for every possible fragment sequence in the library. Thus genomic context is inherent in X!Tandem results. ProteinPilot is a proprietary application fro1n Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex which etnploys the Paragon and Pro Group algorithn1s for spectral peak assigrunent and screening of the top peptide hypotheses respectively (Shilov et al., 2007). The

ProteinPilot search strategy combines de novo sequence determination and FASTA library fragment cmnparison to exclude unlikely candidate peptides frmn scoring. Other novel discrin1inatory routines incorporated into the ProteinPilot software are described in publication (Shilov et al., 2007).

Polypeptide Ion Fragmentation During MS/MS the most common peptide bond fragmentation 1nechanisn1 results in cleavage of the N-terminal carbonyl carbon and the C-terminal nitrogen, producing one of two ions respectively termed the b and y ions in the standard Roepstorff-

6

Fohlmann-Biemann non1enclature. Two 1nore peptide bond fragmentations occur, with accompanying differences in fragment mass (Steen and Mann, 2004). These fragmentations are shown in figure 1. The a/x and c/z series result from cleavage

immediately N-tetminal and C-terminal to the peptide bond carbonyl carbon respectively (Fig 1). Many spectra assigned to peptides contain peaks that cannot be correlated to a, b or y series ion. These peaks can correspond to chetnically modified ions or b and y series ions beyond the mass accuracy tolerance defined in the search parameters. Fragment ions from series not discriminated by the algorithn1 also may be present in the spectra. Search algorithms

often compare spectral data to predicted b andy series without scrutiny of alternate ion series for tryptic peptides ending in charged, basic residues. The contributions of the a/x and c/z series to non-tryptic peptide fragmentation are undetermined. The X!Tandem

7

algorithm can be set to identity all three ion series. ESI and MALDI-Qq-TOF data from serum preparations was searched separately for b/y and for aU ions to evaluate the contribution of a, c, x and z series.

Mass Spectrometry for Polypeptide Quantification Quantitative MS-based approaches for complex protein mixtures include the measurement of peak intensity or peak area, addition of internal standards, multiple reaction monitoring, and isobaric labeling (Andersen etal., 2003; Gygi et al., 1999; Malik et al., 2005; Chelius and Bondarenko, 2002; Cutillas et al., 2005; Domon and Aebersold, 2006; Wu et al., 2006). Peak area can be used to measure peptide abundance with femtomolar sensitivity and accuracy can be in1proved with a correction factor calculated from internal standard measurement (Chelius and Bondarenko, 2002). The dynamic intensity ofMALDI signals and LC ion suppression can introduce error into peak tneasurement, necessitating more complex quantitative methods (Fenyo and Beavis, 2008). The combination of ESI. ion-trap· and MS/MS allows the study of experimentally defined ions by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). In this system precursor ions are isolated and dissociated with a single fragment ion identified (Domon and Aebersold, 2006). Isotope-coded affinity tags (ICAT) allow comparison of analyte concentrations between sample groups (Gygi et al., 1999). The ICAT system involves labeling two or 1nore protein samples at cysteine residues, using chemically identical tags with unique isotope-dependent masses for each sample. The tag incorporates biotin for affinity

8

capture allowing enrichment of the labeled compounds. Following labeling, the samples are combined and analyzed by MS. The analytes are distinguished by their unique Isobaric

isotope-coded masses and quantified by their relative peak characteristics.

labeling systen1s suffer decreased accuracy with samples as cmnplex as serutn (Griffin et al., 2001; Wu et al., 2006). In such matrices, stably expressed proteins can conceal those differing between samples. This is particularly limiting to automated LC-ESI-MS/MS experiments, but can be controlled by manual peak selection with MALDI -Qq-TOF (Griffin et al., 2001). cysteine residues. ICAT is semiquantitative and dependent on the presence of

In contrast, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification

(iTRAQ) label lysine residues and N-tennini, and are therefore con1patible with both non-tryptic and trypsin digested peptides. Despite improved sensitivity and broader peptide cmnpatibility compared to ICAT, iTRAQ has similar limitations to cysteine tagging (DeSousa et al., 2005, Wu et al., 2006). associated with isotope labeling are also problematic. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) is another quantitative method that leverages the difference in isotopic masses for MS analysis (Ong et al., 2002). In SILAC, cells are grown under two conditions in tnedia suppletnented with amino acids containing heavy or light isotopes and MS analysis is perfom1ed as in ICAT and iTRAQ. \Vhile useful for 1nany proteomic applications, this technique is not con1patible with sermn analysis because labeling takes place during translation of RNA into protein. Inten1al standard measurement is a simple, rapid and proven quantitative method shown to be applicable to MS/MS of tissue samples including serum (Cuttilas et al., The cost and lengthy preparation

9

2005, Findeisen et al., 2007, 2008).

Heights and areas of inten1al standard peaks

identified by their known m/z are related to their known concentration over a linear range. The standard signal can be compared to peptide ion signals for quantification. Sensitivity depends on the instrument and must be n1easured for each tnatrix.

Trypsin Digestion and MS/MS Trypsin is a serine protease that cleaves specifically C-terminal to arginine and lysine residues unless these are followed by proline (Olsen et
aL~

2004).

Trypsin

digestion is con1n1only employed prior toMS analysis to fi·agment proteins into smaller, tnore easily ionized peptides. Provided that con1plete digestion is achieved, this

treatment also sin1plifies the searching of MS/MS data against sequence libraries as fully tryptic sequences represent a small nu1nber of all possible fragtnents. While trypsin

cleavage is highly specific, digestion efficiency is dependent on digestion conditions, substrate stability and local tertiary structure even after denaturation (Olsen et al., 2004, Strader et al., 2006, Fenyo and Beavis, 2008). Searching for the spectra of tryptic

peptides alone might cause one to reject valid I\1S/MS data. It is reasonable to assume that searching a tryptic dataset for peptides with any atuino acid at the C-terminus and Ntenuinus will yield the smne tryptic peptide identifications and also any non-tryptic or semi-tryptic peptides but this has not been demonstrated.

10

In and Ex -Vivo Blood Protein Degradation Serum contains the products of complex degradative cascades, some of which result frotn sample handling, which eventually reach a steady state (Marshall et al., 2003, Villanueva et al., 2006, Koomen et al., 2005). This process is mediated by endogenous proteases, a group of enzyn1es involved in biological functions including coagulation cascade in blood, inflammation and the complement system (Reid, 1983, Davie et al.,
1979). Peptides generated during biological responses are compelling diagnostic targets

but their distribution in blood fron1 healthy and diseased populations remain poorly understood. Pronounced increases in specific serum peptides resulting frotn

inflammatory processes can be 1nonitored by MS (Marshall et al., 2003). Coagulation increases peptide concentration in serun1 while plasma, which is not coagulated during production, has relatively lower peptide abundance (Yi et al., 2007). Low abundance serun1 peptide biomarkers may be obscured or destroyed during sample collection and preparation.

Separato:ry Techniques for the Polypeptides of Blood Seruxn polypeptides are comn1only separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), solid phase extraction or chromatography prior to analysis. Two dimensional SDS-PAGE provides relative purity for MS analysis but excision and extraction of the analytes is inefficient and make large scale analysis impractical. One and two dimensional LC-ion trap MS/MS have been applied to sermn

analysis resulting in the identification of over 800 proteins from multiple runs (Shen et al., 2004). Such studies show that powerful separatory techniques capable of resolving

11

thousands of distinct proteins across a wide mass range and pg/ml to tng/ml concentration range cannot produce more than a small fraction of the predicted nun1ber of serun1 proteins.

It is possible that no single satnple preparation technique will enable the

detection of aU serum proteins by tnass spectrometry. Sequential separation cotnbining chromatography and other methods may enhance resolution of low abundance and physiologically significant serum components. Batch chrmuatography with C 18 reversed-phase is exclusively required prior to MALDI or ESI analysis because it ren1oves salt that impedes ionization and instntment performance. When used alone, C 18 tnicrocolumns are non-selective and therefore

provide robust detection of many known serutu analytes, but less abundant species require further separation (Tiss et al., 2007). Solid phase extraction reagents with Serum

selectivity for plastna peptides have been demonstrated (Li et al., 2007).

polypeptides can also be precipitated with salts or organic solvents, with some remaining in solution. Though the supernatant can be rapidly analyzed by MS/MS, it is depleted in protein analytes relative to the pellet (Williams et al.? 2006, Tucholska et al., 2007, Chertov et al., 2004). Organic precipitates of serum protein and peptides can be partially or totally dissolved in aqueous solvent mixtures. Partial extraction tnay differentially dissolve and concentrate specific proteins, enabling their rapid detennination by mass spectrometry.

Serum Preparation and Analysis by Qq-TOF Based on Precipitation and Extraction The objectives of this thesis were to separate serum peptides by precipitation and extraction and identify them with high confidence. A simple preparatory technique for

12

the separation of sermn polypeptides that is compatible with both MALDI and LC-ESIQq-TOF-MS/MS is presented here (fig 2). The Qq-TOF 1nass analyzer detected peptides frmn known serum proteins with high resolution and signal-to-noise ratios. Tandetn

The role of native serum proteases in sermn peptide n1ass distribution was exatnined by MALDI-Qq-TOF using a group of protease inhibitors. The sensitivity of Qq-TOF for sermn analysis was assessed using internal standards in the fmntomole range.

Reagents and Materials
AU solvents used were of HPLC grade.

Acetone, acetonitrile, 50%

glutaraldehyde, tnethanol, water and reagent grade HCl were obtained from Caledon (Georgetown, ON, Canada). NaCl, NaOH and PBS tablets, and all reagents for the preparation of SDS-PAGE gels were from Bioshop (Burlington, ON, Canada). Angiotensin 1, formic acid, [Glu1] fibrinopeptide B, trifluoroethanol (TFE) and protein n1olecular weight standards for SDS-PAGE were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Silver nitrate from BDH was obtained fron1 VWR (West Chester, PA, USA). Normal human sermn was obtained from Gemini Bio-Products (West

Sacramento, CA, USA). Size exclusion filters and Cl8 reversed-phase microcolumns were trom Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA) DEAE-Blue and Cibacron Blue were frorn BioRad (Hercules CA, USA).

Serum Fractionation by Chromatography, Ultrafiltration, Precipitation and Extraction The general smnple preparation strategy for the separation and enrichtnent of serum peptides is illustrated in figure 2. Sermn was precipitated on ice in five volumes of acetonitrile or acetone with or without NaOH or acid and the precipitate was concentrated

by centrifugation at 14000 RPM. The supernatants were dried in a vacuum concentrator
(Labcono, Kansas City, MO, USA) prior to analysis. Acetonitrile pellets were n1ixed

14

with four volumes of solvent and the retnaining solid isolated by centrifugation. The extraction solutions included
water~

acetonitrile and methanol with or without fom1ic

acid, TFE, NaCl, or NaOH. For MS/MS analysis, fonnic acid and TFE concentrations in the extracts were 5% (v/v). Serum precipitated with acetonitrile, n1ethanol, ethanol or isopropanol was extracted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Extract protein

concentration was determined by coloritnetric protein assay (Ghosh et al., 1987). Supetnatants from precipitation and extractions were dried, resuspended in 0.1% fonnic acid and purified over Cl8 reversed-phase prior to MALDI or LC-ESI-Qq-TOF-MS/MS. Dye-affinity partition chrmnatography was performed a preparative batch

(Marshall et al., 2003, Williams et aL, 2006). Serum was diluted in five volumes of loading buffer prior to application. Cibacron Blue and DEAE Blue columns at least 100 microlitres in volume were equilibrated and loaded then washed in five to ten colutnn volun1es of 20mM Tris with 40mM NaGl at pH 8.0 or with PBS pH 7.3. The columns were at least 10 times the volUtne of the serum. Bound protein was eluted in 1 M NaCL For ultrafiltration, serutn was diluted in 20% (v/v) acetonitrile with 100 mM amn1onium bicarbonate at pH 8.3. The protein solutions were applied to wet 50 kDa molecular mass filters and centrifuged at 14000 RPM.

Protease Inhibitor Treatment
Serun1 was divided into 1.5 ml volm.nes and treated with a range of protease inhibitors, then reacted by incubation at romn temperature for 72 hours. Untreated

aliquots were subjected to the same incubation conditions or stored at -20°C for the incubation period. The concentrations of protease inhibitors were 250 microgram/ml 4-

15

(2-Aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), 50 rnicrogram/ml bestatin, 1.0 mg/ml benzamidine, 1.0 mg!tul and saturated phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 2 mg/ml potato tuber carboxypeptidase inhibitor, 100 tnicrogram!Inl soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 3.75 microlitre/ml of a cmnn1ercial protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The protease inhibitor mixture contained AEBSF, aprotinin, bestatin, E-64, leupeptin, pepstatinA. Volutnes of 200 !!L were withdrawn at regular intervals, acidified with fonnic acid and purified by C 18 reversed-phase and spotted onto a MALDI target plate, prior to addition of the matrix n1aterial CHCA.

Dot Blot Protein Assay Total protein concentrations in nonnal human serum and serun1 extracts were measured using a standardized colorimetric assay with densitometry (Ghosh et al., 1987). Samples were dissolved in 0.1% NaOH containing 1% SDS (w/v) or in 1% SDS (w/v) and 1 microlitre volumes were blotted in duplicate or triplicate onto 15.0 cn1 dimneter W11atman # 1 filter papers (Whattnan International, Maidstone, UK). A dilution series of bovine serum albumin in 1% SDS frotn 0.1 to 15 J.tg/J.!L was also spotted in 1 n1icrolitre volumes onto each paper to provide a standard curve. The blots were allowed to dry completely before staining with 0.2% (w/v) Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 (CBBR) in 50% methanoL Assays were dehydxated in 99% methanol and de-stained in a 2:6: 1 solution of methanol, MilHQ water and acetic acid respectively and air dried. Bovine serum albumin (minimum 98%) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Digital hnages of all dot blot assays were acquired with an Epson Expression

1680 flatbed scanner using the

manufacturer~s

software. Images were recorded in RBG

16

colour mode at a resolution of 600 dpi and stored in high resolution format (.tif file extension). To eliminate noise and simplify the extraction of data, the images were processed prior to analysis. Adobe Photoshop 7.0 was used to invert the image colour scale,

making the background appear uniformly black and the Coomassie blue-stained blots to appear varying shades of yellow to white with intensity proportional to their protein concentrations. Following colour inversion, color intensity data was extracted from the images using ImageJ version 1.38x, an open source Java based image processing application publicly available from the National Institute of Health, USA at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/. To minimize bias in the data, segn1ented lines from which

intensity data was collected had no more than one point of inflection. For each separate assay paper, a standard curve was generated from the relative intensities of BSA standards. The R2 values for the standard curves all exceeded 0.97. For each blot, two single points representing Gray Value tnaxima were used to calculate the protein concentration using the equation of the standard curve (Fig 3).

SDS-PAGE Prior to separation by SDS-PAGE, samples were dried in a vacuun1 concentrator and resuspended to equal volumes in buffer containing tricine and DTT, then boiled for 5 minutes. The samples were applied to gels containing 4% actylamide at 30 V then

separated at a constant potential of 90 V on 17% acrylamide gels (Schagger and von Jagow, 1987). Polypeptides were visualized using CBBR in 40% methanol with 10% acetic acid or by diamine silver stain (Dionne et al., 1994).

MALDI-Qq-TOF
Serum extracts were purified using C 18 reversed-phase n1icrocolumns then spotted onto stainless steel target plates (Applied Biosystetns/Sciex) to diatneters not exceeding 3 tnillimeters. The matrix material CHCA (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was manually applied. MALDI MS and MS/MS were manually collected on a QSTAR Elite Qq-TOF in the positive ion tnode, between m/z 0-4400 (AB/Sciex, Concord, ON, Canada ). Three randomly selected points on each dried sample spot were inadiated until ion current declined. MALDI-MS/MS were produced using CID voltages not exceeding 115 eV. Instru1nent calibration was performed using the instructions of the instrument tnanufacturer.

LC~ESI-Qq- TOF

Sermn preparations were purified by C 18 reversed-phase then separated by HPLC. Polypeptides v1ere introduced onto the colunm via a 1 microlitre fixed volume injection loop and separated on a 150 mm 75 micrometer inner diameter capillary colutnn packed with C 18 reversed-phase beads of 3 micrometer diameter and 100 A pore size (LC Pacldngs, A1nsterdan1, The Netherlands). The colunm was operated over a 90

minute gradient frotn 5 to 65% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 200 nanoliters per minute via a Proxion nano-LC capillary pump (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The solutions used for the binary mobile phase system were 94.5% acetonitrile with 5% water and 94.5% water with 5% acetonitrile. Both contained 0.1% acetic acid (v/v). Each A

chromatographic separation was followed by an extensive wash in 65% acetonitrile.

10 micrometer inner diameter PicoTip SilicaTip en1itter was used for electrospray (New

19

Objective, Woburn, MA, USA). The tip was tnounted into a NanoES ion source (Protana Engineering A/S, Odense, Denmark) and an ESI voltage between 1800 and 3000 was applied. The Qq-TOF instrument was operated in the positive ion mode with a curtain gas setting of 20, a declustering potential of 65 V and a 265 V focusing potential. Nitrogen fron1 a Parker Balston LCMS-5000 Tri-Gas Generator (Haverhill, MA, USA) was used as a collision gas with the collision-activated dissociation parameter set to 5. MS scans were acquired for two seconds followed by three product ion scans. Switching criteria used were for ions between 111/z 400 and 1500 Th with charge from 2 to 5 and a tuinimum of 10 counts.

MS/MS Data Analysis Using ProteinPilot, X!Tandent and Relational Databases LC-ESI-Qq-TOF MS/MS data were searched both by X!Tandem and ProteinPilot against a forward human Reference Sequence (RefSeq) FASTA library downloaded from The National Center for Biotechnology Infonnation (NCBI) in 2007 as well as the con1bined forward/reverse library (Pruitt et al., 2007). MALDI Qq-TOF MS/MS results were interrogated using X!Tandem with the same libraries. X!Tandem (Version

2006.06.0 1.2) analyses were conducted with two variables in search conditions. Parent 1nass accuracy tolerance settings of +3-1 Dalton (Da) and ±100 parts per tnillion (PPM) were used. Spectral features were compared to the theoretical b and y fragmentation series and all ion series; a, b, c, x, y, and z. Conserved search conditions included

fragtnent n1ass etTor of 0.4 Da, no enzyme [XIX], no noise suppression, a 1naxhnun1 of 25 missed cleavages, and all possible modifications allowed, excluding mass shifts due to

20

isobaric labeling. The identical data set was searched using ProteinPi1ot Version 2.0.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). All ProteinPilot analyses were performed using the thorough ID search
effort~

phosphorylation emphasis setting and a protein detection threshold of 0.47 (66.0% confidence). The .Mascot algodthtn can be used through ProteinPilot but this feature was not enabled. X!Tandem and ProteinPilot result files were parsed into single Microsoft database (.mdb file extension) format files to facilitate evaluation of the results. The database files retained each
peptide~ s

sequence, precursor protein, tnass, charge, deviation from

predicted tnass (delta), probability scores and corresponding satnple among other characteristics. Access. These were used to filter and rank the MS/MS data with Microsoft

Sequence information provided by ProteinPilot forward and forward/reverse

library searching was used to assess the selectivity of the extraction and analysis protocols for non-tryptic sequences. This was facilitated by Structured Query Language (SQL)~ with the results integrated into Microsoft database repot1s. Peptides with arginine or lysine residues at their C-termini or with these atnino acids immediately N-tenninal to their first residue were designated setui-t:ryptic. Peptides with both of these features were designated fully-tryptic and those with neither were designated non-tryptic.

Internal Standards in Serum for MALDI Analysis
[Glu 1] fibrinopeptide B and Angiotensin 1 were diluted in water and applied to 100 micro litre volumes of normal human serutn to final amounts of 100 femton1oles to 10

21

picomole per tnicrolitre. The spiked sera were prepared by C 18 reversed-phase and spotted onto a 1netal target plate with CHCA for MALDI analysis.

Protein concentrations of replicate extracts using the same solvents were between 0.1 and 8 mg/ml with an average standard deviation around 15% following brief incubation and tninimal disruption of the pellet. Protein concentration was dependent on salt and

acetonitrile concentration. From 20 to 40% acetonitrile, protein content was highest but approached the lower detection limit at concentrations around 65% (Table 1).

Table 1. Protein concentrations among extracts of acetonitrile sermn precipitates measured using a colorimetric assay with Coomassie blue protein stain. Each assay was

23

standardized with bovine serum albumin in 1% SDS (w/v). For each concentration value, four intensity measurements of two replicates were averaged.

Acidic and Basic Extraction There was no clear relationship between protein concentration and HCl content in the aqueous extracts. Total protein was comparable in extracts containing equivalent amounts of formic or acetic acid. Protein concentration increased with NaOH

concentration over a range of 3 orders of magnitude. Base-catalyzed hydrolysis might create soluble peptides from larger less soluble sequences but this effect on protein concentration was 1ninimized by the low extraction temperature. The large range of isoelectric points within the serum proteome is exploited in the isoelectric focusing dimension during two-dimensional electrophoresis. Many different proteins fron1 the acetonitrile pellet likely enter solution over a wide pH range inespective of their isoelectric points.

SDS-PAGE of Protein Extracts Representative extracts were compared by SDS-PAGE and differed in their relative concentrations of high, tn.id and low molecular weight polypeptides (Fig 4). For acetone and acetonitrile pellets, the mass distribution profile from each extraction condition was comparable. Acetonitrile pellet extracts from 60% acetonitrile apparently contained a greater number of low molecular weight bands than equal volumes of the acetone pellet extracts. Extraction in 600n1M NaCl gave n1ore high molecular weight

24

bands using acetonitrile precipitation (Fig 4). Aqueous, 1 mM HCl and 5 mM NaOH extracts had similar profiles by SDS-PAGE with concentrated but poorly resolved low and high molecular mass fractions. The 60% acetonitrile extract was well resolved in the region below 14 kD. In 600 mM NaCl extracts, silver staining of the low molecular mass region was vanishingly faint, though total protein in this sample was decreased by the effect of salt on polypeptide solubility after drying. Considering the decrease in stain intensity with decreasing molecular mass, all extracts from acetonitrile pellets were rich in low molecular mass analytes. Figure 4.

LC-ESI-MS When applied to Cl8 reversed-phase HPLC-ESI, the extracts gave strong ion cuiTents over the entire acetonitrile gradient (Fig 5). Each extraction condition yielded a unique ion current profile, but high quality MS/MS data was obtained over a range of parent ion intensity. Acidified acetonitrile supernatants, aqueous extracts and aqueousorganic extracts had stable and low signals until the acetonitrile concentration of the mobile phase exceeded 45 % (Fig 5). Under basic and neutral conditions, acetonitrile supernatants gave variable ion intensity throughout the separation and the same was true of the acetonitrile/methanol/water mixture. Exceptionally strong signal intensity at high acetonitrile concentrations attest to a large number of hydrophobic polypeptides being retained on column. Ion cuuent from the aqueous extract containing NaOH was high

over the entire course of the acetonitrile gradient. Hundreds to thousands of tandem mass spectra with excellent signal-to-noise were collected
fi~om

each chromatographic run of

the ultrafiltrate, acetonitrile supernatant and extracts. Single runs for separation of the acetonitrile supernatant resulted in 913 MS/MS scans with and 1836 without TFE. The

26

methanoVacetonitrile/water extract had only 562 tandem spectra and 573 when acidified with TFE. The aqueous extract had 203 MS/MS scans by ESI-Qq-TOF.

Figure 5. Total ESI-Qq-TOF ion currents of reversed-phase Cl8 eluates over ninety minute 0-65% acetonitrile gradients. Serum was precipitated with acetonitrile and the samples shown are a) the acetonitrile supernatant; b) acetonitrile supernatant with NaOH; c) acetonitrile supernatant with formic acid and TFE; d) aqueous extract; e) acetonitrile, methanol and water extract; t) acetonitrile, methanol, water and TFE extract; g) serutn extracted with acetonitrile, methanol, water, formic acid and TFE and h) PBS pH 8.8 extract.

Peptides Identified by X!Tandem and ProteinPilot from ESI-Qq-TOF Spectra The high 1nass accuracy spectra obtained by ESI-Qq-TOF allowed high confidence identification of known serum proteins. X! Tandem and ProteinPilot results from the ESI dataset were complementary, with unique spectra assigned to the same sequence by both algorithms. Sequences of known sentm proteins from acetonitrile

supernatants and various extracts obtained probabilities frotn 0 to 99% by ProteinPilot and expectations from E-9 to E-2 by X!Tanden1. Unmodified and tnodified non-tryptic peptides were observed, many common to several different serum preparations. Multiple peptides frmn apolipoprotein AI, Ail AIV, CII, CHI, E and F precursors as well as transthyretin, albumin, fibrinogens, antitrypsin, alpha-2-plasmin inhibitor, complement Cl inhibitor, beta globin, complement C3, cmnpletnent C4, coagulation factor II, coagulation factor XIII Al subunit and inter-alpha (globulin) inhibitor H4 were reported by X!Tandem and ProteinPilot (Fig 6, 7 and 8). The highest scoring peptides for all of these proteins had parent masses between 0.1 and 0.0006 Da of those calculated (Table 2 and 3). Though y ions are typically tnore prevalent than b ions in Quadrupole-

28

TOF instruments, the relative number of these two series was generally comparable in the .MS/MS search results (Fig 7 and 8) (Steen and Mann, 2004). A small nun1ber of fragment ions approached the set X!Tandem mass accuracy limit of 0.4 Da, most varying fron1 the predicted tnass by around 0.1 Da (Fig 7 and 8). Fe"v prominent ions in the high scoring spectra could not be assigned to a fragtnent ion. Neither X!Tandetn or ProteinPilot identified peptides with high confidence frotn ESI-MS/MS data ofCibacron blue and DEAE blue sermn preparation. The ultrafiltration eluate contained albutnin peptides according to both algorithrns (Table 3). MS/MS from acetonitrile pellets extracted in aqueous NaOH had low scoring identifications, albumin and antitrypsin peptides alone receiving expectations below E-2 by X!Tandem. Aqueous and aqueous-organic extracts contained related and identical sequences identified with high confidence. Series of peptides successively cleaved fron1 the same short sequences were observed within and between samples (Table 3). Transthyretin and transferrin were consistently detected following extraction in physiological salt. Coagulation factors and complement C3 and C4 were apparently enriched by ultrafiltration. High scoring

apoHpoprotein peptides were obtained frotn PBS and aqueous-organic extracts as well as ultrafiltration. Figure 6 shows an ESI run of an
acetonitrile~

methanol, water and TFE extract

with a group of apolipoprotein peptides eluting at different points in the acetonitrile gradient. Proteins were identified by multiple spectra frmn the acetonitrile supernatant and different extraction solutions. Many high scoring spectra included parent mass

accuracies below 0.01 Da and multiple intense b and y ions from the predicted series within 0.04 Da of their predicted tnasses (Table 2 and 3, Fig 7). Both algorithtns

29

identified peptides from the smne set of known serun1 proteins. Search results were examined manually and sequences containing strings of alanine, glycine or proline ·were discarded. Assignments incorporating continuous n1ns of a single amino acid typically had X!Tandem expectation values on the order of E-2.

Peptides in the Acetonitrile Supernatant According to the search results for the ESI-Qq-TOF data, peptides from many serum proteins remained in solution following acetonitrile precipitation. Apolipoprotein peptides were identified with high confidence in acidified acetonitrile supernatant but had low scores in the acetonitrile supernatant alone or with NaOH. Acetonitrile precipitation including N·aoH generally yielded poor quality spectra relative to other supernatants, but abundant serum proteins such as albumin and serine (or cysteine) protease inhibitor (antitrypsin) were fotmd in this case (Table 2 and 3). Several peptides from complement C4 were observed with confidence below 90% in this sample pool. Peptides from

albumin and inter-alpha (globulin) inhibitor H4 (ITIH4) were also routinely detected in the acetonitrile supernatants. Focusing the mass range . analyzed between m/z 800 and 2500 may ilnprove resolution, signal and mass accuracy for these analytes.

Reverse Library Identifications

No correlations to reversed serum protein sequences were reported by X!Tandem. Albumin, complement C3 precursor, complement C1 inhibitor and antitrypsin were present in the ProteinPilot reverse library results with probabilities from 0 to 94 %. Reversed peptide hits by X!Tandem were from large proteins such as bassoon protein, keratin as well as smaller proteins such as N-glycanase 1 and calpain small subunit 1 (Table A1). The majority of these reverse hits were from serum extracted under basic

38

aqueous extraction conditions while the supernatant from precipitation with acetonitrile containing NaOH had few reverse hits. ProteinPilot reported a total of 119477 unique peptides fron1 the combined fotward and fo1ward/reverse library searches, with 41573 reversed and 83587 forward sequences. Fmward and reverse libraries shared 5683 identifications by ProteinPilot. The vast majority of these shared sequences were four or five residues in length with the exception of longer repetitive sequences such as QQQQQQLQL and AGGGGGGGG. From 77904 sequences exclusive to the fotward library 3510 proteins were identified with smne redundancy. The number of fmward proteins was dependent on the library used: 3247 were identified frotn forward and 1962 from fmward/reverse searching. The highest scoring reverse library peptides by ProteinPilot were from mucin and titin. Mucin 2, 5B, 16, 17 and 19 were identified from the reverse library \Vith total protein scores between 23 and 165 while mucin 2, 16, 17 and 19 were identified from the fo1ward library \Vith scores of 33, 98, 35 and 208 respectively. Interestingly, X!Tandem did not report n1ucin or titin.

The Effect of X! Tandem Search Parameters on Spectral Assignment Using both the ±100 PPM and +3-1 Da mass tolerance conditions for correlation of MS/MS spectral peaks, the X!Tandern algorithm detected peptides from high abundance blood proteins in serum extracts with parent mass accuracy below 0.05 Da and with expectation down to the order of E-9. Many pep tides with scores approaching E-0 belonged to the same proteins as those identified with high confidence. Identical spectra were con-elated to the san1e peptides using both ±100 PPM and +3-1 Da conditions, with

39

n1inor variations in expectation values and in the number of spectral peaks assigned (Table 4). X!Tandem scored identical spectra differently under different parent mass tolerance settings. Neither the ±100 PPM nor +3-1 Da setting produced consistently lower expectation for the same peptide identifications. A sn1all minority of spectra were assigned identical expectation values when searched under both conditions. Typically, peptides fron1 the same precursor ion yielded expectations ·within one order of magnitude under the two conditions. X!Tandetn matched more peptides to spectra under low parent mass tolerance than high mass tolerance. For instance, searching against the same

fmward/reverse library under the all ion condition yielded 150 redundant sequences by +3-1 Da and 430 by ±100 PPM. Frmn the same results, 26 and 168 reverse library hits were obtained under the Dalton and the PPM conditions respectively. Assuming false positive identification rates are equal to the reverse library identification rate, the lower parent mass tolerance setting yielded a disproportionately large number of false identifications. Though reverse library reporting only approximates an actual error rate, it is clear that the ±100 PPM setting decreases X!Tandem selectivity while increasing sensitivity. The san1e peptide cmTelations and b/y ion assignments were obtained when the data was searched for all ion series and for the bandy series ions alone, but the bandy ion condition consistently reported them with higher confidence. Sorne low scoring

peptides fi·om the b/y series searches were absent from the all-ion searches. Poor scoring peptides frotn sen1m proteins identified with high confidence were rejected by searching for all ion series.

40

Library

size affected scoring and

sensitivity.

Searching against the

forward/reverse library gave identical spectra higher probability compared to searches against the forward library alone. For each sample condition, few or no reverse library identifications were obtained from fotward/reverse X!Tandetn or ProteinPilot searches. Reverse hits were most prevalent in acetonitrile supernatant data. X!Tandem assigned expectation values on the order of E-4 to repetitive glycine or alanine-rich peptides, tnostly pentapeptides with n:Vz around 400. Searching against a combined forward and reverse library yielded fewer forward peptide identifications than searching under the smne parameters against a fo1ward library. Identical spectra were consistently assigned lower expectation values when searched against a fotward library compared to the forward/reverse library. Some entries with expectation values in the order of E-4 or lower were ambiguous short sequences and n1any at E-2 were apparently false positives, containing repeats of the san1e atnino acids or belonging to proteins not known to be in blood. Spectra were manually inspected to ensure that high scoring ions had high signalto-noise ratios. LC-ESI-Qq-TOF-MS/MS spectra with expectation values on the order of E-5 typically contained several ions well within 1 Da of the predicted b and y series, but also n1any assigned ions with intensities approaching baseline. On1itting peaks less than four titnes the baseline would increase expectation values but the n1ajority of ions identified by X!Tande1n were well above this threshold. High scoring peptides fr01n well established blood components illustrate the reliability of peptide identifications from the Qq-TOF data of serum extracts (Table 3).

Modifications of MS/MS Analytes Detected by ProteinPilot and X! Tandem The Paragon algorithm identified cysteinylation, deatnidation, dehydration, fmmylation, methylation, oxidation, and phosphorylation of peptides with confidence exceeding 90% (Table 3). Many peptides were identified with tnultiple modifications. For example the albumin sequence PLVEEPQNLIKQN was identified in nine result files with four deamidations at 99% probability and scores ranging from 16 to 21. ProteinPilot revealed trends in oxidation among peptides. For example, the complement C4 sequence TLEIPGN"SDPNMIPDGDFN was reported to be oxidized specifically at the internal methionine as well as the tenth proline residue but at no other sites including the two retnaining pralines. These two oxidations \Vere observed in acetonitrile-methanol-water ultrafiltrate and PBS extracts and the unmodified peptide was also present. Paragon identified the fibrinogen alpha phosphopeptide DpSGEGDFLAEGGGV in the extract containing acetonitrile, n1ethanol, water and TFE (Table 3, Fig 8).

Detection of Internal Standards
Using MALDI-Qq-TOF-MS, [Glu 1] fibrinopeptide B and Angiotensin 1 were detected in spiked serum at nanmnolar concentration, or in amounts in the femt01nole range (Fig 9). These appeared as ions with well resolved isotopic envelopes an1ong a series of serum analyte peaks. At the lowest concentration tested both standards were above the limit of detection although angiotensin 1 was barely resolved from the baseline. The practical detection limit for angiotensin was somewhere between 100 and 250 fen1to1nole per micro litre. Internal standards did not appear to depress ionization of the

44

endogenous peptides as an untreated control yielded Ions with the same masses at comparable intensities.

Effects of Protease Inhibitors on MALDI-MS There was no clear pattern in the MALDI-MS spectra of serum incubated at ambient temperature with small molecule and protein protease inhibitors over a 72 hour period. From the initial to the final samplings, the mass distribution from 0 to around 2800 Th was comparable among all samples (Fig 10). Variability in signal intensity between the initial sampling of the room temperature control and the thawed frozen control was high (Fig 10 a, Fig A1). Several MALDI peaks, including those at m/z 991, 1325,2011,2116, and 2753 were common to the untreated controls and the experituental treatments over the period examined. With the exception of the first, an of these ions had masses within 1 Da of serun1 peptides identified from the ESI-Qq-TOF data, for instance the albun1in peptide DAHKSEVAHRFKDLGEENFKALVL with a mass of 2753 Da (Table 3). Transient MALDI signal intensity over the entire mass range examined was apparent between sampling times and may have resulted from variation in C18 chromatography, matrix application or inherent variation of matrix-assisted ionization (Fig 10 a, b, d). Treatment with a commercial protease inhibitor n1ixture of broad specificity produced spectra similar to those from single inhibitor treatments as wen as the control (Fig 10 e).

DISCUSSION

Extraction Parameters Influence Polypeptide Composition Organic precipitation followed by liquid extraction allows non-tryptic peptide detection from sermn by Qq-TOF-MS/MS. Precipitation concentrates and purifies the sen1m protein fraction and extraction selectively solubilizes polypeptides for analysis. This technique is simple compared to many serum fractionation schemes previously investigated and demonstrates the presence of readily accessible peptides in sera. Even brief incubation of the setum pellet in water alone dissolved a group of non-tryptic peptides detected by ESI-Qq-TOF (Table 2 and 3). Low ten1perature organic precipitation in acetone or acetonitrile did not restrict the protein from reentering the liquid phase, and is therefore useful for the removal of contaminants from serum protein. Precipitation-liquid extraction-based serum

preparations are rapid and disposable but may be difficult to reproduce. Variable and dynamic composition of sera influence pellet formation and likely protein solubility. The protein concentration and texture of acetonitrile pellets are dependent on mixture speed and centrifugation time (Merrel et al., 2004). An excess of solvent must be applied for etiective precipitation (Chertov et al., 2004). These variables and the temperature of both precipitation and extraction must be controlled for consistent extraction efficiency. Serum protein 1uay decompose during freezing and thawing though apparently accurate quantitative MS/MS data can still be obtained after repeated freeze thaw (Song et al., 2006). MALDI analysis of untreated serum exhibited the same ions as a sample n1aintained at room temperature (Fig 10 and AI).
50

Samples used in this study were

thawed, aliquoted and refrozen once prior to use and disposal. Clinical serum sarnples are not necessarily frozen prior to analysis though variables during sermn production may have much greater effect on proteomic data (Karsan et aL, 2005). Comnassie blue-based protein assays in SDS were not dramatically affected by salt concentration for aqueous extract supernatants with NaCl concentrations fron1 100 mM to 2 M. From 3 to 5 M NaCl, blot diameter tnay have increased due to high ionic strength, decreasing apparent protein concentration, though these satnples fit the predicted trend (Fig 3). Protein concentration in acetonitrile pellet extracts frmn 600 mM to 5 M NaCl decreased to the point of complete precipitation. The n1ixture behaved in agreement with the accepted concentration cwve of a single protein. At 600 mM NaCl, low tnolecular mass analytes could not be detected in SDS-PAGE by silver stain. Serum peptides must therefore be extracted below this concentration.

The Effect of Salt on Polypeptide Solubility
Protein solubility decreases with increasing salt concentration and at high salt concentration is defined by the equation: logS=
-am+~·

Here, Sis the solubility of a
~

specific polypeptide, m is the n1olar concentration of a given salt and a and

are

constants (Cohn, 1925). The slope and x-intercept of a given sequence's concentration curve are represented by a and
~

respectively. The above equation, though a crude

reflection of the relationship between salt and protein concentration, hnplies that specific polypeptides precipitate at specific salt concentrations. The protein solubility model has been expanded considerably to include thennodynamic properties such as osn1otic second virial coefficients (B22) which reflect protein-protein interactions and the preferentiaJ

51

binding parameter (f23 (m)) a limit which describes protein-solvent-cosolvent interactions (Ruckenstein and Shulgin, 2006, Neal et at, 1998). Two notable equations incorporating these parameters separately were derived by Ruckenstein and Shulgin, demonstrating relationships between
B22

and concentration at low solubility and between

r 23 (m)

and

phase change at low cosolvent concentration (Ruckenstein and Shulgin, 2006). Using measured .822 and

r 23 (m)

values for lysozyme, predicted "'salting in" and "salting ouf'

conditions for specific proteins in aqueous NaCl and MgCh solutions were shown to be in agreement "'With experimental results. Furthetmore, at low salt concentration, the curve of the solubility versus tnole fraction function can be predicted (Ruckenstein and Shulgin, 2006). It is feasible that an extraction systen1 designed with the use of such equations would solubilize a set of peptides from organic pellets while confining others to the solid phase. Sentm polypeptides do not differ enough in their solubility curves to exclude the majority of the protein fraction from aqueous NaCl extracts while retaining certain analytes (Table 1, Fig 4lane 6). While peptide or protein enrichtnent based on salt conditions may offer low selectivity, it should help exclude erroneous peptide or protein identifications frotn MS/MS data if a solubility cutoff based on sample extraction condition is applied to the FASTA protein library searched. Experhnental validation of this cutoff and of

concentration dependent solubility for a group of known serun1 proteins may enable the evaluation of MS!MS peptide results with increased scrutiny. It should be noted that the equations mentioned have been applied to the study of pure proteins with molecular masses exceeding 14kD, while the extent to which complex tnixtures such as serum deviate from current models is unknown. Protein solubility solutions containing

52

multiple solvents, such as the aqueous extracts with acetonitrile, methanol and TFE employed in this study, requires further characterization.

The Effect of Solvents on Polypeptide Solubility Organic cosolvents decrease protein concentration in aqueous solutions by decreasing the dielectric constant of the system and displacing water from the protein surface (Arakawa and Timasheff, 1985). This principle is applied in chromatography, where polar C 18 reversed-phase columns are washed with acetonitrile to elute bound protein. For acetone and acetonitrile pellets extracted in aqueous solutions of increasing acetonitrile concentration, protein concentration followed the accepted trend in solubility. Biphasic liquid extraction is an effective technique for polypeptide separation and can be highly selective. Hydrophobic solvents can separate polar and non-polar polypeptides in mixtures for direct MALDI-.MS analysis (KjeHstrom and Jensen, 2003). Both low and high molecular weight proteins were extracted with butanol as a precipitating solvent and these were con1parable in distribution to ethanol supernatants by SDS-PAGE (Tucholska et al., 2007). A precipitation to selectively remove non-polm· peptides, using ethyl

acetate or butanol for instance, could improve resolution in subsequent separations. The preferential binding parameter is n1ore useful than B 22 for the prediction of protein solubility in organic-aqueous solutions, with the organic cosolvents of focus being urea, glycerol, glycine or polyethylene glycol. The atypical solubility behavior of beta-lactoglobulin in glycine-buffered aqueous solutions of varying pH suggests protein mixtures like serum can be preferentially extracted (Arakawa and Timasheff, 1987). The organic solvents employed in the present study have negligible buffering capacity but

53

considerable impact on the behavior of water molecules. This could account for the relative equivalency in the number and type of peptides observed in acetonitrile supernatants with and without NaOH or acid (Table 2 and 3). An analyte that elutes by reversed-phase or ion exchange chron1atography at a given acetonitrile or salt concentration respectively, could be stripped from an organic pellet under similar conditions. This method permitted the detennination of known serum proteins by

MALDI-Qq-TOF (Fig 11 ), and n1ay in1prove resolution and run tilue of LC-ESI-MS/MS.

Surfactants and Non-Polar Solvents The solutions used for liquid extraction in this study were free of surfactants, which impair peptide analysis by inhibiting trypsin digestion or ionization (Zhang and Li, 2004, Steen and Mann, 2004). Surfactants are particularly useful for solubilizing

hydrophobic compounds though other conditions can be controlled to extract these. Peptides from apolipoproteins, which circulate with extensive lipid modification, were soluble in aqueous and organic solutions. Peptides presented in this serum study are not particularly hydrophobic (Table 2 and 3). Non-polar solvents can be used in either

precipitation or extraction to partition non-polar species. For rnass spectrometric work on hydrophobic proteins, non-polar solvents are preferable to surfactants.

Diagnostic Paradigms of Peptide Identification and Pattern Profiling Can be Unified The mass distribution and intensity of serum peptide ions observed by MS were suggested to be applicable to disease diagnosis with the use of mathematical

54

interpretation (Petricoiu et aL, 2002, Ornstein et al., 2004).

These MS profiling

diagnostics were shown to be biased by artifacts of satnple handling and unreliable for differentiating disease from normal states (Dian1andis, 2003 and 2006). Ex vivo endo- and exopeptidase activity fonns peptide patterns in serum (Marshall et al, 2003, Koon1en et al., 2005). Patterns of relative ion intensity are difficult to reproduce by MALDI, and this variability must be addressed before a discrhninatory 1nethod based on this principle can be successful. Accurate ratiometric 1neasurement of peptide abundance depends on a reliable control signal in the MS data, a feature absent frmn many previous studies. A known analyte whose signal intensity can be controlled within a known range would represent such a control. Though ion intensity patterns may elude reliable interpretation, accurate m/z values can be correlated to specific biomolecules with defined statistical certainty, provided they exceed a minimum signal-to-noise ratio. As more peptides are identified fron1 blood fluids, a data analysis strategy incorporating MS/MS search and pattern recognition functions might reveal new patterns in peptide or protein distribution among diseased populations. A proteomic or peptidomic serum profile including a group of known peptides may constitute a diagnostic tool particularly if combining detection or quantification of a group of low significance bio111arkers in a single san1ple discriminates physiological. states. Diagnostics based on MS patterns can include the simultaneous detennination of ion identity. Interestingly, such studies identify many peptides with sequences partially matching those in Tables 2 and 3 as being responsible for cancer dependent patterns although relative ion intensity in the absence of an added internal standard was used as the criterion for measuring their abundance (Villanueva et al.,

55

2006).

The great diversity and apparent transience of peptides from known sermn

proteins observed here and in other studies may explain why poor reproducibility continues to plague MS profiling diagnostics. Sentm peptides extracted in aqueous and aqueous/organic conditions were consistently detected by ESI-Qq-TOF, suggesting they can be reliably quantified by multiple reaction monitoring (Domon and Aebersold, 2006).

Combined ESI MS/MS and MALDI MS for the Characterization of Serum Peptides Peptides observed by LC-ESI were compared to those apparent in the MALDIQq-TOF spectra. Many of the peptides detectable as +1 ions in the MALDI profile could be identified by LC-ESI-Qq-TOF. This result suggests that many peptides can be

detected and identified by ESI MS/MS that cannot be readily identified by MALDI MS/MS. M.ALDI peptide ions bad comparable parent mass accuracy to those observed by ESI, but relatively few peptides were identified from lVIALDI MS/MS by either algorithm used. Since the peptides we observed are not tryptic and many do not contain basic atnino acid residues, these may not ionize or fragn1ent as efficiently by MALDI compared to ESI-MS/MS. MALDI MS peaks can be attributed to specific peptides by comparing their n1asses to those observed in separate sequencing experiments, provided mass accuracy within 1Da (Richter et al., 1999). The high tlu·oughput of ESI and its compatibility with MS/MS search algorithms make it ideal for the collection of reference data. The sermn extract dataset included peptide ions con1mon to MALDI MS and ESI data (Fig 10 and 11 ). Many of these were detected in similar sample preparations by both methods, for instance the same ITIH4 peptide ions were present in aqueous extracts (Table 2 and 3,

56

Fig 11). High precursor ion accuracy obtained using both ion sources and high product ion mass accuracy of the ESI data increase confidence of the identifications (Fig 11 ). From the MALDI-MS/1\IIS dataset, X!Tandetn identified apolipoprotein AIV and ITIH4 peptides with parent ions of m/z 1771 and 2010 respectively (Fig 12) confirming their presence in MALDI MS scans. Automated screening of MALDI MS data against ESI data has been developed but an extensive library specific to blood peptides is needed (Zimmetman et al., 2005). Construction of an extensive ESI-MS/MS database of serun1 peptides and its application to MALDI-MS is feasible using Qq-TOF and SQL databases. Analyte primary structure, sample preparation, and ionization conditions all contribute specific ionization charactetistics, with consequences for sequence coverage in MS analysis. An MS/MS library consisting of spectra from overlapping sequences of the entire proteome would likely require all proteins to be isolated to near purity for analysis. Alternatively, a spectral database built from MS/MS of serum extracts, ultratiltrates and chromatography could be assembled relatively quickly but would be far less cmnplete. Data processing speed is detennined in part by the size of the FASTA library being screened. An abbreviated library including only biomarker proteins or MS/M.S spectra of their commonly observed peptides would be 1nany times stnaller than the RefSeq database (Pruitt et al., 2007).

X! Tandem and ProteinPHot Interpretation of Qq-TOF Tandem Mass Spectra
Peptides fro1n known blood proteins were identified \Vith confidence from E-9 to E-2 or as high as 99% by X!Tandem and ProteinPilot, respectively. Spectra scoring above E-2 were rejected, as they were likely spurious and their contribution to the overall

57

confidence of protein identification was negligible. Smne of these sequences were also identified with high probability and are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Low and high scoring identifications frmn a common sequence can strengthen confidence in a single protein match, a feature exploited by the Pro Group algorithtn (Shilov et al., 2007). ProteinPilot results for individual peptides discussed below had minimum probabilities of 95%, though Pro Group included peptides below this threshold in the protein scores. A variety of cleavage sites among peptides from common sequences suggest a complex degradative process precedes mass analysis, one that can be monitored by QqTOF. Multiple related peptides from the smne short spans of their precursor proteins, differing in length by single and multiple amino acid residues, were obtained from single extractions (Tables 2 and 3). These are consistent with an initial cleavage of peptides from ·whole proteins followed by amino- and carboxypeptidase activity on these (Marshall et al., 2003). Such patterns are heavily influenced by sample preparation

conditions (Yi et al., 2007). Tryptic peptides apparently are differentially susceptible to decomposition prior to LC-MS analysis and the same may be true of any peptide (Alves et al., 2008). A sermn extract sample may therefore contain peptides that cannot be definitively associated with a protease.

Apoiipoprotein Non-redundant sequences from seven apolipoprotein isofom1s were detected by LC-ESI-Qq-TOF in all samples except the dye affinity column eluate. Apolipoproteins have relatively low serum concentration by mass, but their molar serun1 concentration is high (Hortin, 2006). The apolipoproteins reported by both algorithms are between 9 and

58

46 kDa in n1ass. Compared to albumin, with a mass of 67 kDa, short apolipoprotein sequences are less likely to be falsely identified as their set of theoretical fragtnents is relatively smalL Apolipoprotein Ali has been shown to be over expressed in prostate cancer tissue and serum concentrations of apolipoprotein CU and CHI differ between normal and pancreatic cancer populations (Malik et al., 2005, Chen et al., 2007). Supetnatants from serum precipitated in organic solvent containing TFE were suggested to contain cancer-dependent concentrations of apolipoprotein AU by SELDI-TOF and LC-MS/MS (Chertov et al., 2004). Interestingly, this species is apparently downregulated in a B cell lymphoma mouse model, though detailed explanation of this result was lacking.

Serum Protease inhibitors
Protease inhibitors were detected by M:SIMS in acetonitrile supetnatants and ultrafiltration eluates as wen as aqueous and organic extracts (Table 2 and 3). ITIH4, Con1plement C 1 inhibitor and serine (or cysteine) proteinase inhibitor were all dissolved under multiple extraction conditions. Plasma concentrations of inter-alpha inhibitors range fron1 0.6 to 12 tng/ml and this glycoprotein family has been studied by SELDI and LC-Q-TOF MS/MS (Josie et al., 2006). ITIH4, the fourth inter-alpha inhibitor heavy chain to be discovered, has a unique 300 residue C-terminal sequence and lacks the C-terminal covalently bound bikunin moiety that contributes to the inhibitory properties of this group (Sagucbi et al., 1995). All ITIH4 peptides detected in the serum extracts were within this 300 residue region, from either the 3140 Da sequence NFRPGVLSSRQLGLPGPPDVPDHAAYHPF frorn

59

position 659 to 687 or the 3155 Da sequence NVHSGSTFFKYYLQGAKIPKPEASFSPR frmu to 617 to 644 of the 930 amino acid sequence matched by BLAST (Table 2 and 3) (Altschul et al., 1997). Bonding between inter-alpha inhibitor heavy chains and bikw1in as well as the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan increases their mass and alters their stability and this may explain their absence in the MS/MS data. Inter-alpha heavy chains can be dissociated frmu glycosaminoglycan by alkaline treatment such as 50 mM NaOH at 23°C (Josie et al.~ 2006). Factors other than this post-translational n1odification could have prevented the detection of other ITIH species because serum precipitated or extracted in the presence of NaOH did not yield hits for metnbers of this group, although low temperature was used and the detrilnental effect ofNaOH on MS/MS is noted below. Inter-alpha inhibitors have been hnplicated in sepsis and cancer progression {Lhn et al., 2003, Himn1elfarb et al., 2004, Fung et al., 2005, Song et al., 2006). Peptides from the C-terminal region of ITIH4 have been measured in sermn from normal, cancer and diabetes populations by hrununoaffinity SELDI-TOF, and were found to be variable (Fung et
aL~

2005, Song et al., 2006). Many of the same ITIH4 peptides were in the

serum extracts studied here. Peptides at m/z 3157, 2270, 2626, 2723, 3027 and 3140 were identified by ProteinPilot with 99% confidence, with and without modification (Table 3). These had the same predicted sequences as reported previously, and were contained within the two regions mentioned above (Song et aL, 2006). X!Tanden1

identified the saxne sequences at m/z 3157 and 2270, with expectation values above E-4. According to both algorithms, serum extracts contained additional ITIH4 peptides fron1 those described as potential biomarkers (Table 2 and 3). The diversity of peptides

observed frmu two short portions of the ITIH4 sequence suggests the kallikrien-mediated

60

proteolysis of the molecule is follo\ved by non-specific cleavage (Nishimura et a.l., 1995). ITIH4 and antitrypsin peptides produced exceptional spectra and could be used to evaluate MS/MS pedonnance in serutn analysis (Fig 12, Table 2 and 3). To test the clinical utility of protease-derived patten1s in serum, measurement of serum protease inhibitor concentration or a protease-to-inhibitor ratio should be possible using Qq-TOF.

Serum Proteins Identified from the Reverse Library Cmnplement C 1 inhibitor and serine (or cysteine) proteinase inhibitor had forward and reverse library hits but their forward identifications were not rejected on this basis. In the case of Con1plement C 1 inhibitor, of aU reverse library associations only one spectrwn scored higher than 25% probability, a quadruply-modified 34 residue sequence with only 60% confidence. The length of this sequence alone casts doubt on its validity. By con1parison, the forward library matches for this protein included 11

peptides with scores exceeding 90% and 7% sequence coverage above 95% confidence. One reversed antitrypsin peptide with four modifications scored 76% confidence, the remainder scored well below 50%. These cases exemplify the independence of ttue positives on reverse library results. A probability threshold of E-2 established by manual inspection of forward library results effectively screened the data.

Evaluation of Reverse Search Results ProteinPilot identifications of mucin peptides were likely false and demonstrate that accuracy of probability-based identification depends on sequence length as well as

61

library length (States et al., 2006). Peptides from 1nucin isofom1s were identified by ProteinPilot frotn both the forward and reverse library. The isofonns identified vary in length from 4493 residues for mucin 17 to 14507 residues for mucin 16. As with

albmnin, the lengths of these sequences contribute to false identification of these unlikely peptides in both the forward and reverse libraries. AU forward and reverse mucin 19 sequences with scores fron1 90 to
99~o

were high in threonine, glycine, and serine

residues. These were distributed throughout the sequences with the exception of pairs of threonine residues. More than twice the nmnber of mucin 19 peptides was reported from the forward compared to the reverse library within this confidence range, suggesting that false positive rate estimation based on reverse library identifications does not accurately retlect the tn1e rate. Criteria for accepting peptide and protein assigrunents can be

established from forward only searches as an alternative to determining a false positive rate by reverse library searching. Con-ect sequences from ProteinPilot and X!Tandem results were therefore manually differentiated from false positives on the basis of protein identity, spectral features and sequence characteristics. More than half of the reverse peptides found in the extract data by X!Tanden1 under two parent mass accuracy settings were fron1 MS/MS of basic aqueous extractions, while neutral and acidit1ed extracts gave few reverse hits. With few exceptions, forward hits from this sample pool had poor scores (Table 2). These findings indicate that sodium hydroxide in the extracts had a negative effect on spectral quality (Table AI).

62

MS/MS Search Paratn.eters Influence Peptide Results ProteinPilot identified more forward library sequences when an identical dataset was searched against
fo~rard

and forward reverse human FASTA libraries. X!Tandem

assigned better scores using a forward only library. It is conceivable that the increased processing burden of screening a double library causes both algorithms to function below their optimal perfonnance. Consequently, experimental and control searches should be conducted separately. The drawback to such a strategy is that it elhninates cotnpetition between the target and control libraries for the assigm11ent of spectra, creating bias in forward identifications (Elias and Gygi, 2007). Though sequence reversal is not a

randon1 process, reverse library results are generally accepted as allowing the calculation of accurate false positive discovery rates (Kapp et al., 2005). Randomized lists identical in size to the forward list n1aintaining the representative protein sequence lengths and number of each mnino acid can also be used (Rarnos-Fetnandez et al., 2008). Though randomized and reversed libraries have been clahned to provide sinlilar estimated false positive rates a standard decoy design has yet to be implemented (Qian et al., 2005). The stringencies of the two X!Tandem parent tnass tolerances used here depend on analyte tnass. For a 1 kDa peptide, 100 PPM represents a mass of 0.1 Da. A setting of± 100 PPM becornes less stringent than the +3-1 Da condition for sequences exceeding
10 kDa, though this is beyond the mass range studied and precursor ions identified with

this level of 1nass accuracy would be manually rejected. Accuracy provided by the tnass spectron1eter is directly linked to search algorithm performance (Brosch et al., 2008). As the range including the true n1ass of a given ion decreases so does the nmnber of possible sequences that fit this range. Consequently fewer candidate sequences must be evaluated

63

by the algorithn1. Mass stringency settings in search algorithms obey this pattern. At low stringency, specificity improves and sensitivity decreases whereas high stringency increases both false and conect identifications (Brosch et al., 2008). This concept is

supported by results of the X!Tanden1 parent mass tolerance experiment presented here. Under the strict ±100 PPM condition, X!Tandem identified more proteins and more false positives than under the +3-1 Da condition. An exceptionally high number of reverse sequence identifications were observed cmnpared to a previous study using the ±100

PPM: condition (Brosch et al., 2008). This was likely due to other operational variables
such as the use of non-tryptic data and a reverse library as opposed to a tryptic dataset with a randomized library. When X!Tandem results from b/y and all-ion series w·ere compared, the advantage of detecting the a/x and c/z ion series was shown to be offset by an overall decrease in expectation values. Using the same raw data, Protein:Pilot built a

con1plementary peptide list, reporting b and y ions ·with and without a nutnber of biological and chemical 1nodifications. sufficient for conect spectral interpretation. Based on these observations b/y ions are

Modified Serum Peptides ProteinPilot reported a variety of che1nical modifications which were independent of probability scores (Table 3). While sotne of these modifications are likely artifacts of san1ple handling and ionization, physiological modifications such as phosphorylation may be of clinical use. The phosphorylated fibrinogen alpha sequence

DpSGEGDFLAEGGGV identified by Paragon and shown in figure 8 has biological

64

consequences.

Fibrinogen alpha and fibrinopeptide A are known to circulate and

phosphorylation at this residue is wen documented (Adkins et al., 2002, Chan et al., 2004, Marshall et al., 2004). Fibrinopeptide A n1oderates the acute phase reaction and fibrinopeptide A phosphorylation increases during this inflan1matory process (HenschenEdman, 2001, Masuda and Sugiyama, 2001, Seydewitz and Witt, 1985). A fibrinopeptide A phosphopeptide has been observed in sermn by MALDI-TOF previously (Williarns et al., 2006). Fibrinopeptides released into circulation during myocardial infarction have been studied by LC-ESI-ion trap (Marshall et al., 2003). Other participants in the acute phase reaction have been identified as non-specific cancer tnarkers by MS (Juan et al., 2004). X!Tandem labeled peaks in some spectra as b and y senes tons with modifications, though expectation values were not greatly affected by these assignn1ents. Multiple peaks with nvz corresponding to 17 or 18 Da shifts, due to hydrolytic cleavage of the peptide C-terminus, were assigned with mass accuracy around 0.1 Da. In general, searching for all modifications allowed by X! Tandem provided no additional information about the proteins extracted or physiological modification. Modifications are often found by con1paring observed ion mass to the sum of a predicted n1ass and the tnass of a known modification. An alternate approach to locating modifications involves probing spectra for fragments with mass shifts of any n1agnitude then identifying the modification responsible. MS-Alignment is a narve searching program which aligns multiple spectra to elucidate which fi·agtnent, and ideally which residue, has a different mass from the unmodified version (Tsur et aL, 2005). Such a search strategy tnay not be feasible for screening non-tryptic peptides against a whole

65

species library, but would certainly require n1any repetitions to build a reliable MS/MS database. The nun1ber of possible sequence-modification candidates from an undigested proteomic sample tnight increase search space to an unmanageable degree. That a

number of related and identical sequences were observed from the extracts is favorable for the MS-Alignment approach to serum peptides modification analysis (Table 2 and 3). Post-translational tnodification is essential for the regular function of tnany proteins. regulated. Phosphorylation is a complex process hnportant in signalling and is strictly Uncontrolled kinase activity is associated with cancer (Blume-Jensen and

Hunter, 2001 ). Phosphorylation can be n1onitored using several technologies but MS based systen1s alone do not require complete phosphoprotein purification (Mann et al., 2002). A nmnber of biological properties challenge the detection and quantification of protein phosphorylation. High basal phosphorylation, around a third of all eukaryotic proteins, is a batTier to phosphoproteomic tnining of disease san1ples by MS (Mann et al., 2002}. Peptides in the serum extracts may be dephosphorylated by phosphatases after

satnpling so inhibitors rnust be added during blood collection. Genomic and protemnic data mining for phosphorylation sites cotnbined with phosphorylation targeted Western blot can identify candidate biomarkers. Screening candidate sites using MS adds high throughput and resolution. The atnino acids serine, threonine and tyrosine are

phosphorylated at levels differing over four orders of magnitude suggesting their signalling strengths may be inversely proportional to their concentrations. If minute changes in tyrosine phosphorylation have dramatic physiological consequences, the sensitivity of MS may make it uniquely suited to phosphorylation-based diagnostics.

MALDI-Qq-TOF Analysis of Serum Treated with Protease Inhibitors

In vivo, peptides are created and removed from circulation through a cascade
involving numerous proteases of varying specificity. The clotting cascade is an exan1ple. Truncation of proteins produces peptides which are then degraded into successively sn1aller fragtuents. Renal filtration retnoves molecules s:maller than 45 kDa and is

maximal for those below 5 kDa (Anderson and Anderson, 2002, Werle and BernkopSclmurch, 2006). The exopeptidases, divided into amino- and carboxypeptidases,

therefore regulate peptide-tnediated activities and plastna homeostasis. The effect of proteases on peptide formation following serum preparation was exatnined by MALDI-Qq-TOF. A number of ions with m/z between 700 and 2800 were comm.on to spectra fron1 the controls, from the point inhibitors were added and the time points sampled. Signal intensity of the comn1on ions varied by three orders of n1agnitude and was independent of incubation time and the inhibitor used (Fig 10). This suggests inherent variability in MALDI peak intensity and m/z distribution can confound meaningful interpretation of MS serum peptide profiles. Over the period studied, sermn protein degradation appeared to reach a steady state regardless of protease inhibition. Progressive cleavage produces tnany low molecular mass polypeptides with a corresponding decrease in larger species. This would be observed by MS as a shift in ion distribution with increasing numbers of low m/z ions, however at 72 hours the control had n1ore peaks above m/z 2500 than at the initial satnpling and their signals were among the highest. A battery of eight protease inhibitor conditions failed to maintain the distribution of serun1 peptides over a 72 hour period more than untreated controls at room

67

temperature and -20°C (Fig 10). This finding is in agreement with the observation that proteolysis begins at collection and has progressed considerably by the time senun is n1ade. Addition of metal chelating protease inhibitors during blood collection modulates ex-vivo degradation, which suggests that collection is a critical point in the control of diagnostic blood peptide characteristics (Yi et al., 2007). In 2002 the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO) began the Plasn1a Proteome Project (PPP), a large scale international effort to describe the polypeptides of blood (On1enn et al., 2005). The study en1ployed MS/MS \Vith multiple separatory techniques to characterize pooled blood specirnens. Plasma augn1ented with EDTA or citrate or

heparin and unadulterated serum were prepared frotn the PPP blood satnples. Ahnost half of the se1um peptides were not found in the plasma samples, providing further evidence that protease inhibition cannot control peptide fonnation during serum preparation (Tammen et aL, 2005). The serine protease inhibitors PMSF and AEBSF affect circulatory enzymes such as kallikrein, plasn1in and thrombin and therefore lhnit fibrinopeptide fonnation. Fibrinopeptide ions at m/z 2011 appeared in PMSF samples at the first satnpling and in the AEBSF sample after 8 hours. It is likely that this fragment was present in the latter sample but did not ionize as AEBSF is an irreversible inhibitor should stop protease activity permanently (Fig 10 b). In the presence of water, PMSF has a half life around one hour at physiological pH and to account for its dilninishing efficacy, it was used at two concentrations well above the 1ninimum inhibition. These conditions apparently did not impact ionization as serum supersaturated with PMSF produced intense ions by MALDI-MS (not shown). AEBSF has similar selectivity to PMSF but is more stable in

68

aqueous solution and MALDI profiles were comparable in the presence of these two reagents. extraction. Equilibrium between endopeptidase and exopeptidase catalysis controls the abundance of endopeptidase generated peptides, with consequences for quantitative analysis based on peak measurement. The effect of exopeptidases on MALDI-MS of sermn was therefore exatnined. aminopeptidase (Taylor, 1993). Bestatin is an inhibitory transition state analog of Potato carboxypeptidase hihibitor inhibits Serine proteases clearly create peptide patten1s prior to precipitation and

carboxypeptidase A. If exopeptidases act on serum peptides over the course of the three day incubation, these two inhibitors might have decreased baseline signal, particularly in the low tnolecular mass region. Compared to the control however, neither of these resulted in lower signal-to-noise ratio, with the most intense peaks being 75 times the baseline intensity on average (Fig 10 d). Serun1 peptides generated by proteases with specificity differing frmn those used for digestion pose a challenge to search algorithms. In fact non-tryptic assignments are used in the evaluation of search algorithm perfbnnance to assess false..;positive rates (Kapp et al., 2005). The ESI and MALDI-Qq-TOF data shown in this study

sufficient resolution and mass accuracy for the confident assignment of non-tryptic peptides. An increased computational burden associated with non-tryptic data must be recognized, though increasing computing power addresses this issue.

69

Tryptic Peptides in Serum Extracts
ProteinPilot results fron1 fotward and forward/reverse library cmnparisons were screened for tryptic cleavages using an SQL database. This method assigned peptides as non-tryptic, semi-tryptic or fully tryptic. According to the selected enzymatic cleavage criteria tryptic peptides were almost absent from the set examined as was expected due to the mnission of trypsin (Table 5). Albumin had the highest number of tryptic peptides, around 8%, while 13 of the 22 proteins investigated had none. The peptides examined were filtered by their unique sequences to produce a non-redundant list. Whether the inclusion of a peptide score cut-off would a:tiect the ratio of tryptic to non-tryptic peptides ren1ains unkuo-vvn though the presence of apparently tryptic peptides is of little consequence \Vhen high probability and 1nanual inspection determine the validity of identifications. Setni-tryptic sequences represented arotmd one fifth of those examined and this is more likely due to the protemnic abundance of arginine and lysine than to trypsin. Enzyme-specific searching is not required for the analysis of large proteomic datasets provided high accuracy MS/MS results are used. The high selectivity of trypsin cleavage is well documented and adds confidence to peptide assignments (Olsen et al., 2004). Where n1ore detailed information regarding

in situ protein stability is required, non-tryptic peptides with mass accuracy exceeding 0.1
Da confirmed by equally accurate MS/MS experiments should be used. If a diagnostic peptidomic signature exists in serum, it 1nay be obscured by enzymatic digestion prior to
MS/MS.

Though peptide degradation in complex samples can be monitored by MS/MS, the processes responsible are incompletely described. The use and improven1ent of non-

70

tryptic identification should help address this paucity of infonnation.

Separation of

tryptic fron1 non- or semi-tryptic data has been used for strengthening protein identifications (Alves et al., 2008). This showed that non-tryptic peptides above an

established Mascot probability threshold to be reliable. A tnachine-learning con1ponent enabled the relationships between residue identity, location and peptide decay to be studied and commonalities between the sequence information and chymotryptic specificity were described. A similar strategy for extended serum peptide analysis,

exatnining both known and learned cleavages, should allow aU degradative processes to be interpreted by MS/MS.

Internal Standards in Untreated Serum Detected by MALDI-MS Polymeric biological analytes can be quantified by internally or externally standardized mass spectrometry, a practice common in small molecule analysis. Here MALDI-Qq-TOF was shown to distinguish two 1nolecules added to the equivalent of one micro litre of senun from peptide analytes in a single scan. Isotopic resolution suggests that these internal standards can be identified using LC-ESI-Qq-TOF. Triple quadrupole instruments have traditionally offered lower sensitivity than TOF, and this accounts for the prevalence of such instruments for exploratory blood protein research. The sample volumes used as well as the observed detection limits of the internal standards suggest low abundance peptides can be quantified by MALDI-QqTOF, with the advantages of excellent resolution and accuracy (Fig 11 ). Tuning the MS tnass window increases sensitivity and might permit the quantification of the least

71

abundant sequences, provided the standards approach the mass of the polypeptides under investigation. [Glu 1] fib1inopeptide B and Angiotensin 1, which are similar in n1ass and structure to the peptides
observed~

gave peak heights well above baseline at

concentrations equivalent to moderately abundant serum proteins (Anderson and Anderson, 2002). Exogenous peptides are ideal for standardizing peptide samples

because they have shnilar ionization properties and can be distinguished from sample cmnponents by MS/MS. This study demonstrates that Qq-TOF can be employed in peptide quantification at a physiologically relevant scale.

72

CONCLUSIONS
In this study, organic precipitation followed by liquid extraction and mass spectrometry were applied to simultaneously n1.onitor peptides frotn a nutnber of known serum proteins with high confidence without prior trypsin digestion. Silnple and rapid extractions were complementary for the enrichment of non-tryptic peptides with good signal-to-noise by MALDI and ESI-Qq-TOF. Precipitation and extraction exhibit low selectivity and are effective separatory techniques for fractionating cmnplex samples which can be used directly or prior to further sen1m separation. ESI-MS/MS provided spectra that achieved high confidence peptide assigrunents
by X!Tandem and ProteinPilot. When paired, the two algorithms were in agreement

regarding the identity of high quality MS/MS, but ProteinPilot identified additional pepti.des at all levels of confidence. Both were susceptible to bias due to FASTA library size and forward-only searching in1proved scores of manually verified sequences. To discriminate serum peptides, X!Tandem should be operated in the b/y ion tnode as opposed to the aU-ion tnode. X!Tandem interpreted only a stnall nutnber of MALDI tandem mass spectra as belonging to peptides. Peptides could be identified in MALDI-MS peaks by n1atching their highly accurate 1nasses with ESI-MS/MS results. Decomposition affected serum analytes prior to organic precipitation as protease inhibitors with varying specificity did not tnoderate sennn peptide profiles by MALDI. The most in1portant period for preserving diagnostically relevant peptide information is likely around the titne of blood collection. Measures tnust be taken to prevent clotting and other protease-driven reactions from obscuring endogenous peptides. Metal

73

chelating compounds such as EDTA and clotting inhibitors such as heparin have been used for preserving blood proteins (Yi et aL, 2007). The set of proteins tron1 non-tryptic peptides observed in the serum extracts represent a sn1all fraction of the nun1ber known to be in sermn. The n1ass accuracy and resolution of Qq-TOF in both single and tandetn MS tnodes pennitted the study of a representative group of serum peptides.
