Abstract
This thesis proposes EOQ models for deteriorating items with time­dependent demand, as well as price­dependent demand, for both partial and complete backlogging scenarios. For each type of demand, three different models are developed: (1) items are first sold at the high­end market at a higher price; and then, at a given time, the leftover inventory is transported to the low­end market and sold at a lower price; (2) items are sold only at the high­end market. However, discount on the selling price is offered after a certain time; and (3) items are sold only at the high­end market without any price discount. The proposed models are solved to determine the optimal total profit, optimal order quantity, time at which inventory becomes zero, and optimal backlogged quantity. Finally, numerical examples and a sensitivity analysis are given to illustrate the proposed models.

Chapter 1 Introduction
This thesis develops EOQ models for deteriorating items considering high­end and low­ end markets for two different groups of customers. Deterioration is defined as change, scrap, decay, damage, spoilage, obsolescence, and loss of utility or loss of original value in a commodity (Manna et al. (2009)), and (Wu et al. (2000)). As a result, deterioration leads to the decreasing usefulness of a commodity. For example, the price of seasonal fashion goods (clothes, sweaters, shoes, etc.) is sharply reduced or goods are disposed of after the season is over. High­tech electronics products (e.g., laptops, computers, digital cameras, mobiles, and flash drives) lose their values over time because of rapid changes of technology or the introduction of a new product by competitors. Similarly, spoilage or damage occurs if grocery items such as dairy products, fruits, vegetables, meats, etc. are kept over a period. In order to minimize the loss due to deterioration, companies dealing with deteriorating items follow a two­market model (high­end market and low­end market) for two groups of customers (Jrgensen and Liddo 2007). The high­end market consists of customers who have the ability to pay a higher price and are willing to buy new, improved, and higher quality products. For example, when a new fashion or technology is launched, high­end customers are always interested in buying it. Therefore, companies keep in1

troducing, innovative, and improved products to attract the customers at the high­end market. On the other hand, the low­end market sells lower price products suitable for customers who are not willing or able to pay higher price. In marketing literature, simultaneous and consequence strategies to introduce low­ end and high­end products are discussed in Moorthy and Png (1992) and Padmanabhan et al. (1997). In this thesis, the focus is on the case where products are first introduced in the high­end market and then the leftover products are sold in the low­end market. For this particular scenario, there are many real­world applications. For example, in China, batteries are first sold in the high­end market (urban customers) and then in the low­end market (rural customers). In Thailand, some bakeries use this strategy to sell their products in the high­end market (urban customers) and low­end market (rural customers). Computers are sold in the high­end market (Canadian domestic market) and then the leftover is sold in China. Jrgensen and Liddo (2007) address the case where a fashion firm sells its products in the high­end market for a limited time and then sells its products in the low­end market to compete with imitators, dispose of leftover inventory, and to enhance the benefit from the original design. The EOQ model for deteriorating items has been studied by a number of authors since 1953. Different authors focus on two different demand patterns: time­dependent demand and price­dependent demand. Goswami and Chaudhuri (1991), Hariga (1993), Chakrabarti and Chaudhuri (1997), Dye (1999), Wu (2002) developed the EOQ model for deteriorating items considering time­dependent demand, in particular, linear trends. On the other hand, Abad (1996), Abad (2001), Dye (2007), Abad (2008) studied price­ dependent demand. However, according to the author's knowledge, there is no study that develops an EOQ model for deteriorating items considering a two­market model. In this thesis, three different EOQ models are developed for both time­dependent demand and price­dependent demand: (1) a two­market model; (2) a one­market model with discounting; and (3) a one­market mode without any price discounting. In each 2

EOQ model, two different scenarios are studied: partial backlogging and complete backlogging. In the two­market model, the products are first sold in the high­end market for a period of time and then the unsold products are transported to the low­end market. For both time­dependent demand, and price­dependent demand, the objective of the two­market model is to determine the time at which the inventory level becomes zero, t3 (see Figure 3.2), and the optimal order quantity, Q, that can result in the maximum total profit. In one­market model with discounting, the products are sold in the high­end market for a period of time and then the price is discounted in the high­end market without transporting to the low­end market. For both time­dependent demand, and price­dependent demand, the objective of the one­market model is to determine the optimal order quantity, Q, the discounted price in the high­end market, Pd , and the time at which the inventory level becomes zero, t3 (see Figure 3.3) that can result in the same total profit obtained in the two­market model. In the one­market model, the products are only sold in the high­end market without any price discounting. This model is developed to determine the selling price that can be offered to make the same profit as the two­market model. For both time­dependent demand and price­dependent demand, the objective of this one­market model is to determine the optimal order quantity, Q, the price in the high­end market, Po , and the time at which the inventory level becomes zero, t3 (see Figure 3.4). In this thesis, demand rate is assumed to be different for different markets. In the existing literature, inventory level decreases due to market demand and deterioration. However, in the proposed models, the inventory level decreases only due to deterioration during the transportation from the high­end market to the low­end market. Also different selling prices for different markets are introduced, and the optimal selling prices of different markets for the model with price­dependent demand are determined. The remainder of this thesis is organized as follows: Chapter 2 provides the literature review on EOQ models for deteriorating items. Chapter 3 presents EOQ models for 3

deteriorating items with time­dependent demand and Chapter 4 presents EOQ models with price­dependent demand. Chapters 5 and 6 illustrate several numerical examples by using the proposed models in Chapters 3 and 4, respectively. Lastly, in Chapter 7, the conclusion of this thesis and future work are presented.

Chapter 2 Literature Review
This chapter reviews the relevant literature on EOQ models for deteriorating items. One of the most important concerns for the inventory management is to decide how much inventory should be ordered each time so that the total cost associated with the inventory system will be minimized. The Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model is usually used to determine the optimal order quantity that minimizes the total cost. One of the basic assumptions of the EOQ model is the infinite life of products, i.e., the quality of products remains unchanged. However, deteriorating items either become damaged or obsolete during their normal storage periods. As a result, if the rate of deterioration is not sufficiently low, its impact on the modeling of such an inventory system cannot be ignored. Inventory problems for deteriorating items have been studied extensively by many researchers. Research in this area started with the work of Whitin (1953), who assumed that fashion good's deterioration takes place at the end of the prescribed storage period. But certain commodities may shrink with time by a proportion that can be approximated by a negative exponential function of time. For the first time, Ghare and Schrader (1963) established an EOQ model with exponentially decay, i.e., the constant rate of deterioration over time. However, the rate of deterioration increases with time 5

for a few commodities such as fruits, vegetables, dairy products, etc, and it has been observed that the time of deterioration of those items can be expressed by a Weibull distribution. For the first time, the assumption of the constant deterioration rate was relaxed by Covert and Philip (1973), who used a two­parameter Weibull distribution to represent the distribution of the time to deterioration. Further, Philip (1974) extended this model to a three­parameter Weibull Distribution. Misra (1975) also adopted a two­ parameter Weibull distribution deterioration to develop an inventory model with finite rate of replenishment. Then Tadikamalla (1978) examined an EOQ model assuming Gamma distributed deterioration. Fujiwara and Perera (1993) developed an EOQ model for inventory management under the assumption that product value decreases over time according to an exponential distribution. Therefore, a more realistic model is the one that treats the deterioration rate as a time varying function. To avoid complexity, several researchers including Abad (1996), Abad (2001), Dye and Ouyang (2005), Dye et al. (2007), Dye (2007), and Abad (2008) developed inventory models where deterioration depends on time only. However, deterioration does not depend on time only. It can be affected by season, weather, and storage condition as well. According this observation, several studies such as Wu et al. (2000), Giri et al. (2003) considered a two­parameter Weibull distribution to represent the distribution of the time to deterioration. Demand plays a key role in modeling of inventory deterioration. The demand may be static or dynamic throughout the lifetime of the product. Static demand is of rare occurrence in practice as demand for product often varies with several factors such as time, price, stock, etc. Some deteriorating products are also seasonal in nature and demand for them exhibits different patterns during different seasons. Demand can be categorized into: a) uniform demand, b) time dependent demand c) stock dependent demand and d) price dependent demand and e) stochastic demand. Since this thesis focuses mainly on the time­dependent and price­dependent demand, we review these two topics below.

2.1

Time­Dependent Demand

In the classical EOQ model, it is assumed that the demand rate is constant. However, in the real life situation, the assumption of constant demand is not always suitable. The demand for a few products may rise during the growth phase of their product life cycle. On the other hand, some products' demand may decrease due to the introduction of more attractive products. This phenomenon motivates researchers to develop deterioration models with time­dependent demand pattern. Silver and Meal (1973) proposed a heuristic solution for selecting lot size quantities for the general case of a time­dependent demand pattern, which is known as "Silver Meal Heuristic". Donaldson (1977) probably was the first investigating the classical inventory model with a linearly increasing demand pattern over a known and finite horizon. However, the computational procedure of this model was too complicated. Silver (1979) considered a special case of the linearly increasing demand pattern and applied the "Silver and Meal Heuristic" method to solve the problem raised by Donaldson (1977). Later, McDonald (1979), Ritchie (1980), Ritchie (1984), Ritchie (1985), Mitra et al. (1984), and Goyal (1985) contributed to this direction. However, neither inventory shortages nor backlogging was considered in the above papers. Deb and Chaudhuri (1987b) was the first incorporating shortages into the inventory lot-sizing problem with a linearly increasing time­dependent demand. Goswami and Chaudhuri (1991) considered the inventory replenishment problem over a fixed planning horizon for a linear trend demand with backlogging. Hariga (1993) pointed out some errors in Goswami and Chaudhuri (1991) and provided an alternative simple algorithm to determine the optimal solution. Several researchers including Chakrabarti and Chaudhuri (1997), Dye (1999), Wu et al. (2000), Wu (2002), Teng et al. (2003), and Manna et al. (2009) developed inventory models considering shortages for deteriorating items with a linear trend demand pattern. 7

2.2

Price­Dependent Demand

In some cases, the retailer's inventory level is affected by the demand, which is price sensitive. It has been seen that lower selling price can generate more selling rate whereas higher selling price has the reverse effect on the selling rate. Therefore, the problem of determining the selling price and the lot size are related to each other. Cohen (1977) first investigated the pricing problem facing by a retailer who sells a deteriorating product. By assuming that the selling price during the inventory cycle is a constant, he outlined the optimal pricing and ordering policy. Dynamic pricing and lot-sizing problem for deteriorating products were studied by Abad (1996). It was assumed that the retailers may vary a product's price over the cycle time. The selling price for a given time maximizes only the instantaneous revenue rate and does not depend on the lot size and the cycle time. The problem is solved through two subproblems: at first the optimal price was determined for a given cycle time and then the optimal cycle time was determined for the given optimal price. Time varying price is very difficult to administer. In some grocery stores, the selling price is held constant over the inventory cycle for administrative convenience. Abad (2001) assumed that the selling price within the inventory cycle is constant and investigated the pricing and lot sizing problems simultaneously. Chang et al. (2006b), Dye (2007), and Dye et al. (2007) studied the pricing and lot sizing problem for the infinite planning horizon assuming the demand rate to be a convex, decreasing function of the selling price, and the revenue to be a concave function of selling price. Recently, Abad (2008) developed a model for backlogging case, which assumed that the demand rate is a decreasing function of price and the marginal revenue is an increasing function of price. When shortages occur, the following cases may arise: (1) all demand is backlogged; (2) all demand is lost due to impatient customers; or (3) a portion of demand is back8

logged and the rest is lost. Ghare and Schrader (1963) first investigated an EOQ model without shortage for deteriorating items. Deb and Chaudhuri (1987a) were the pioneer to introduce the shortage into the inventory model with a linear trend demand pattern. They allowed shortages in all cycles except for the last one. Chakrabarti and Chaudhuri (1997) extended the model by allowing shortages for all cycles. However, all the above models assumed that during a shortage period either all demands are backlogged or all are lost. Padmanabhan and Vrat (1995) developed a model with zero lead time for partial backlogging. The backlogging function depends on the amount of demand backlogged. For some electronics and fashion commodities with short product life cycles, the length of the waiting time for the next replenishment is the major factor affecting the backlogging. During the shortage period, the willingness of a customer waiting until the next replenishment depends on the length of the waiting time. The backlogging rate declines with the length of the waiting time. To reflect this phenomenon Abad (2001) introduced the backlogging rate depending on the time to replenishment. The fraction of backlogging decreases with the time that customers have to wait until the next replenishment. Two different backlogging rates were proposed: time proportional rate and exponential rate. However, since the costs of backlogging and lost sales are hard to estimate, they were not incorporated into the model. Dye and Ouyang (2005) proposed a time proportional backlogging model by adding the costs of backlogging and lost sales. A unique optimal solution was established in which building up inventory has a negative effect on the profit. Later, Chang et al. (2006a) proposed a revision of the previous model and justified that building up inventory is profitable. Dye et al. (2007) amended Abad's exponentially backlogging rate model by adding the costs of backlogging and lost sales.

Chapter 3 Models for Time­Dependent Demand
This chapter presents EOQ models for deteriorating items with time­dependent demand. It is assumed that there is no repair or replacement of deteriorating items during the cycle time. The time varying deterioration rate is considered and the time to deterioration is described by a two­parameter Weibull distribution, which has a probability density function f (t) and a cumulative distribution function F (t): f (t) = t -1 e-t and F (t) =
t 0
 

f (t) dt = 1 - e-t , where  > 0 and  > 0 are scale and shape parame-

ters, respectively, and t is the time to deterioration, t > 0. The deterioration rate can be obtained from (t) =
f (t) , 1-F (t)

and hence, the instantaneous rate of deterioration of the on-

hand inventory is (t) =t -1 . The Weibull distribution is related to a number of other probability distributions. For example, when the shape parameter  = 1, it refers to an exponential distribution; when  = 2, it refers to a Rayleigh distribution. Figure 3.1 indicates, for  = 1, the deterioration rate is constant with time. When  < 1, the deterioration rate decreases with time, and when  > 1, it increases with time. However in this thesis, it is assumed that  > 1, which means the deterioration rate increases with time.

Figure 3.1: Relationship between rate of deterioration and time In the literature, inventory models with time­dependent demand are considered for both linear and exponential demand with either increasing or decreasing demand. For example, a linear demand is described by D(t) = a + bt, where a > 0 and b = 0; and an exponential demand is described by D(t) = Aet , where A > 0 and  = 0. In this thesis, a general demand function, D(t), is considered in developing the models. In order to investigate the insight of these models, in the numerical section, a demand function, D(t) = a + bt, where a, b > 0, is considered. However, one can apply any time­dependent demand function in the developed models.

3.1

Two­Market Model

This model focuses on how the given new product is sold in the two markets. It is assumed that a new product, e.g., a fashion product, has only one cycle. It is also assmued that the unmet demand in the low­end market is backlogged and met with the next incoming 11

product. This method has been in practice in many retail stores. If one has the situation where there is no backlog, it can be set to zero. The two­market model consists of a high­end market and a low­end market for two different levels of customer. The order quantity Q > 0 is instantaneously received at the high­end market, and then the inventory level gradually diminishes due to demand and deterioration at the high­end market. At given time t1 , the leftover products are transferred from the high­end market to the low­end market and they arrive at time t2 . The transportation time, t2 - t1 , is assumed to be constant. A certain percentage of the items deteriorates during transportation due to material handling and storage conditions. As soon as the items arrive at the low­end market, the backlogged quantity (B ), is fulfilled. The rest of the inventory decreases due to demand and deterioration at the low­end market; and ultimately goes to zero at time t3 . A typical behavior of the inventory system in a cycle is depicted in Figure 3.2. The next incoming product is replaced in the high­end market at time t1 . If it is assmued that the current product and the next incoming product have the same inventory profile and t2 = t3 - t2 , then the next incoming product will reach the low­end market at time t3 and there is no backlog. If t2 > t3 - t2 , then there will be backlog in the low­end market. However, in this two­market model, we do not focus on the incoming product.

For the two­market model with time­dependent demand, selling prices at both markets are assumed to be given. Customers at the high­end market buy a product at price P1 and customers at the low­end market buy a product at cheaper price P2 , i.e., P1 > P2 . The price discrimination exists because some items always lose their value over time due to deterioration; and the age of the items also has a negative effect on the price due to loss of customer confidence in the quality. As a result of price discrimination, higher demand is expected at the low­end market. The high­end market demand is denoted by D1 (t) and the low­end market demand is denoted by D2 (t), where D2 (t) > D1 (t). 12

3.1.1

Partial Backlogging

For partial backlogging, during the shortage period, some excess demands are backlogged and the rest of them are lost. That means, when shortages occur, some customers are willing to wait and the others would turn to other suppliers. The backlogging rate depends on the length of the waiting time for the next replenishment. The longer the waiting time is, the smaller the backlogging rate would be. Hence, the proportion of customers who would like to accept backlogging at time t is decreasing with the waiting time, (T - t), for the next replenishment. The backlogging rate is expressed as
1 , 1+ (T -t)

where  > 0, which is similar to the one in Abad (2001), Dye and Ouyang (2005), and Chang et al. (2006b). Let I1 (t), I2 (t), I3 (t), and I4 (t) be the on­hand inventory level at any time 0  t  t1 , t1  t  t2 , t2  t  t3 , and t3  t  T , respectively. The instantaneous state of 13

inventory level at the high­end market (i.e., 0  t  t1 ) is governed by the following differential equation: dI1 (t) = -D1 (t) - (t)I1 (t), 0  t  t1 . dt (3.1)

At the high­end market, the inventory gradually depletes due to two factors: one is demand and the other is deterioration. On the right hand side of Equation (3.1), the first term represents inventory depletion due to market demand and the second term represents inventory depletion due to deterioration. Substituting deterioration rate at any time t, (t) = t -1 , in Equation (3.1), it can be written as dI1 (t) + t -1 I1 (t) = -D1 (t). dt This is a first order linear differential equation and its integrating factor is e
t -1 dt

(3.2)

= et .




Multiplying both sides of Equation (3.2) by the integrating factor et , we obtain dI1 (t) t   e + t -1 I1 (t)et = -D1 (t)et . dt (3.3)

The left hand side of Equation (3.3) can be simplified by product rule and then it can be expressed as d   {I1 (t)et } = -D1 (t)et . dt Now, integrating both sides of Equation (3.3) with respect to time, I1 (t) = - D1 (t)et dt + k1 . et


At time t = 0, inventory level is the maximum. Applying this boundary condition, I1 (0) = Q, I1 (t) = Q-

At time t1 , the leftover inventory is transferred from the high­end market to the low­end market. During transportation time, inventory level depletes only due to deterioration. The instantaneous state of inventory level during transportation is given by dI2 (t) = -(t)I2 (t), t1  t  t2 . dt (3.5)

Now, substituting (t) = t -1 and dividing both sides of the above equation by I2 (t), we get, dI2 (t) = -t -1 dt. I2 (t) Integrating both sides of the above equation, it can be written as I2 (t) = k2 e-t .


(3.6)

The value of k2 can be found by applying the boundary condition that I1 (t1 ) = I2 (t1 ). Hence, Q-

(3.7)

At time t2 , transported items arrive at the low­end market and then B amount of inventory is used to fulfill the backlogged demand. After fulfilling the backlogged demand, inventory level decreases due to demand and deterioration in the low-end market. The instantaneous state of inventory level in the low­end market is given by dI3 (t) = -D2 (t) - (t)I3 (t), t2  t  t3 . dt (3.8)

Now, substituting (t) = t -1 and integrating both sides of the above equation with respect to time, I3 (t) = - D2 (t)et dt + k3 . et 15


Using the boundary condition I2 (t2 ) - B = I3 (t2 ), we obtain I3 (t) = Q-

At time t3 , the inventory level goes to zero and shortage occurs. A percentage of shortages is backlogged and the rest is lost. Only the backlogged units are replaced by the next replenishment. The inventory level is governed by the following equation: dI4 (t) D2 (t) =- , t3  t  T. dt 1 +  (T - t) (3.10)

With the boundary condition I4 (t3 ) = 0, solving Equation (3.10), we obtain the following

Complete Backlogging

In a complete backlogging case, all shortages in the low­end market are backlogged and they are replaced by the next replenishment. In this case, the average total cost per unit time is the summation of the purchase cost, holding cost, deterioration cost, transportation cost, and backlogging cost. However, there is no opportunity cost, because all shortages are backlogged. Therefore, substituting  = 0 in Equation (3.26), we get 23

The concavity of the profit function and the optimal value of t3 can be simply obtained from the partial backlogging case by substituting  = 0 in appropriate equations.

One­Market Model with Discounting

The deterioration rate of deteriorating items usually increases with time. In the marketplace, in order to reduce the loss due to deterioration and to increase the market demand rate, one of the strategies is discounting on the selling price. Hence, our aim is to develop a one­market model, where order quantity is received instantaneously at the high­end market and backlogged demand is satisfied, if there is any; and then the items are sold at 24

a higher price for a given period, and after that the price is discounted at the high­end market without transporting the items to the low­end market. The inventory profile for this model is given in Figure 3.3, where Q is the total amount of order quantity at the beginning of each cycle. After fulfilling the backlogged demand, S is the maximum inventory level at time t = 0. As time progresses, the inventory level decreases due to demand and deterioration. At fixed time t1 , a discount on unit selling price is offered to increase the demand. D1 (t) is the demand before discounting, Dd (t) is the demand after discounting, and usually Dd (t) > D1 (t). The inventory level decreases due to deterioration and demand; and ultimately it reaches zero at time t3 . Shortages occur from time t3 to T and this could be either partial backlogging or complete backlogging. It is assumed that the initial price (higher price) from time 0 to t1 in this one­market model is the same as the price from time 0 to t1 in the two­market model, but the discounted price from time t1 to t3 is determined such that the total profit obtained from this one­market model is the same as that of the two­market model. In addition, similar to the two­market model, optimal time at which the inventory becomes zero,
  t 3 , the optimal order quantity, Q , and the optimal backlogged demand, B , are also

optimally determined.

3.2.1

Partial Backlogging

In this case, during the shortage period, some excess demands are backlogged and the rest of them are lost. Let I1 (t), I2 (t), and I3 (t) be the on­hand inventory level at any time 0  t  t1 , t1  t  t3 , and t3  t  T , respectively. The instantaneous state of inventory levels in the interval [0, T ] are governed by the following differential equations: dI1 (t) = -D1 (t) - (t)I1 (t), 0  t  t1 . dt dI2 (t) = Dd (t) - (t)I2 (t), t1  t  t3 . dt 25 (3.35) (3.36)

Figure 3.3: Inventory profile for the one­market model without discounting with dI3 (t) Dd (t) =- , t3  t  T. dt 1 +  (T - t) (3.37)

The solutions of the above differential equations (3.35), (3.36), (3.37) are obtained by applying the boundary conditions I1 (0) = S, I2 (t3 ) = 0, and I3 (t3 ) = 0, respectively. Hence, the inventory level during the interval [0, t1 ] is I1 (t) = The inventory level during [t1 , t3 ] is I2 (t) = S-

To calculate the cost function including purchase cost, holding cost, backorder cost, opportunity cost, and deterioration cost, we follow the same process applied in the previous two­market model with the partial backlogging case. Therefore, the total cost per unit time is c (t3 ) =

P1 is the same selling price as in the two­market model during [0, t1 ] and Pd is the discounted selling price. Therefore, the total sales revenue per unit time can be expressed as SR = 1 P1 T

Now, the objective is to determine the optimal time t 3 and the discounted selling price Pd that can result in the same profit as in the two­market model. In order to determine 27

optimal time t 3 ,  (t3 ) is differentiated with respect to t3 and set to zero as follows:

f (t3 ) = Pd - - het3


 Pd C - Cet3 + 1 +  (T - t3 ) 1 +  (T - t3 ) t3  (C2 + C3  )(T - t3 )  e-t dt + - C1 et3 + C1 ] = 0. 1 +  (T - t3 ) 0

(3.45)

In Equation (3.45) Pd and t3 are two unknown variables. Therefore, for a given Pd (C < Pd < P1 ), Equation (3.45) is solved to determine optimal t 3 . In addition, the sufficient condition is that the total profit function needs to be concave and must satisfy
d2  (t3 ) |t=t dt2 3 3

< 0,  t 3 > 0. Consequently, the derivative of Equation (3.45) with respect to

t3 can be expressed as:

d2  (t3 ) -Pd  C Dd (t  3)  -1 t  = | [ - Ct e 3 + t = t 3 2  2 3 2 dt3 T (1 +  (T - t3 )) (1 +  (T - t 3 ))  t3 (C2 + C3  )     -1 t  -1 t 3 - ht e - C1 {t e 3 }] < 0. (3.46) e-t dt - h - 3 3  2 (1 +  (T - t3 )) 0
d2  (t3 ) |t=t dt2 3 3

It is clear from Equation (3.46), that

always less than zero for the given Pd

(C < Pd < P1 ). Then, by solving the Equations (3.45) and (3.44) simultaneously, one can determine the discounted selling price Pd , which can result in the same profit as the two­market model.

3.2.2

Complete Backlogging

In this case, all shortages are backlogged and they are satisfied by the next replenishment. Substituting  = 0 in Equations (3.44) and (3.41), we get the total profit per unit time and total order quantity for the complete backlogging case. 28

The optimal value of t 3 can be obtained from the partial backlogging case by substituting  = 0 in Equation (3.45) and the concavity of the profit function can also be shown by substituting  = 0 in appropriate equations. After substituting t 3 in Equation (3.47), one can determine the discounted selling price Pd that can result in the same total profit obtained in the two­market model.

3.3

One­Market Model

In this section, the aim is to develop a one­market model, where order quantity is received instantaneously at the high­end market and backlogged demand is satisfied, if there is any, and then the items are sold at a fixed price, P0 , at the high­end market without transporting the items to the low­end market. The inventory profile for this system is depicted in Figure 3.4. Replenishment is made and backlogged demand is satisfied at time t = 0, and then the maximum inventory level is S . The inventory level decreases due to customer demand and deterioration and it becomes zero at time t3 . Let Do (t) be the demand rate at any time for the one­market model. Shortages occur from t3 to T and this could be partially or completely backlogged. 29

The fixed price per unit, Po , is determined such that the total profit obtained from this one­market model is the same as that of the two­market model. Moreover, similar to the two­market model, the optimal time at which the inventory becomes zero, t 3, the optimal order quantity, Q , and the optimal backlogged demand, B  , are optimally determined.

3.3.1

Partial Backlogging

In this case, during the shortage period, some excess demands are backlogged and the rest of them are lost. Let I1 (t) be the inventory level at any time t(0  t  t3 ) and I2 (t) be the inventory 30

level during shortage period (t3 , T ). The behaviour of the inventory level is governed by the following differential equations: dI1 (t) = -Do (t) - (t)I1 (t), 0  t  t3 . dt dI2 (t) Do (t) =- , t3  t  T. dt 1 +  (T - t) (3.49) (3.50)

Applying the boundary condition I1 (0) = S in Equation (3.49) and I2 (t3 ) = 0 in Equation (3.50) we get I1 (t) = S-

Now, the objective is to determine the optimal value of t 3 and the selling price Po . At first, in order to determine optimal time t 3 , taking the first derivative of  (t3 ) with respect to t3 and setting it to zero will give the following: Po -
 Po C - Cet3 + 1 +  (T - t3 ) 1 +  (T - t3 ) t3   (C2 + C3  )(T - t3 )  - het3 e-t dt + - C1 et3 + C1 ] = 0. 1 +  (T - t3 ) 0

(3.57)

In Equation (3.57) Po and t3 are two unknown variables. Hence, for a given Po (Po > C ), Equation (3.57) is solved to determine the optimal value of t 3 . In addition, for a given Po , the total profit function needs to be concave and must satisfy
d2  (t3 ) |t=t dt2 3 3

quently, taking the derivative of Equation (3.57) with respect to t 3 yields the following: d2  (t3 ) C -Po    -1 t |t=t - Ct e 3 + = 3 2  2 3 2 dt3 (1 +  (T - t3 )) (1 +  (T - t 3 ))  t3 (C2 + C3  )     -1 t  -1 t 3 - ht e e-t dt - h - - C1 t e 3 < 0. 3 3  2 (1 +  (T - t3 )) 0 Equation (3.58) shows, for a given Po (Po > C ),
d2  (t3 ) |t=t dt2 3 3

(3.58)

< 0. Then, solving Equations

(3.56) and (3.57) simultaneously, one can determine a selling price Po for which the total profit of this one­market model will be the same as the total profit of the two­market model.

3.3.2

Complete Backlogging

In this case, all shortages are backlogged and they are replaced by the next replenishment. Substituting  = 0 in Equation (3.56), we get the total profit per unit time for complete backlogging case as:

The optimal value of t 3 and the concavity of the profit function can be shown by substituting  = 0 in the corresponding equations of the partial backlogging case. Then, using this t 3 , one can determine a selling price Po from Equation (3.59) by applying the iterative method, that can result in the same profit obtained in the two­market model.

Chapter 4 Models for Price­Dependent Demand
In reality, the demand depends on the product's price. In the literature, several types of price dependent demand pattern were studied by several researchers. For example, Dye et al. (2007) assumed demand rate as D(P ) = a - bP and D(P ) = aP -b ; Abad (2001) described the demand by the constant price elasticity function, D(P ) = ae-bP . The following assumptions are made for demand function: 1. D(P ) > 0 for P > 0. 2. D(P ) is a continusous, convex, decreasing function of the selling price. All inventory equations and cost functions for two­market model, one­market model with discounting, and one­market model are calculated as same as the time­dependent demand model in previous chapter.

4.1

Two­Market Model

The inventory level follows the pattern which is shown in Figure 3.2. The high­end market demand is denoted by D1 (P1 ) and the low­end market demand is denoted by D2 (P2 ), 34

where P1 and P2 are the high­end and low­end market selling prices respectively. It is assumed that D2 (P2 ) > D1 (P1 ). In order to maximize the total profit per unit time,
 we need to determine the optimal selling price of the high­end market P1 , the optimal  selling price of the low­end market P2 , and the optimal time at which the inventory level  becomes zero, t 3 . As a result, the optimal order quantity Q and the optimal backlogged

quantity B  are also determined.

4.1.1

Partial Backlogging

Using the same argument as deriving (3.26), we can obtain the total profit  (t3 , P1 , P2 ) per unit time for the partial backlogging case when the demand depends on the selling price. 1  (t3 , P1 , P2 ) = [P1 D1 (P1 ) T

In this function, t3 , P1 , and P2 are unknown variables. The objective is to determine the
  optimal t 3 , P1 , and P2 which maximize the total profit  (t3 , P1 , P2 ). Apparently, we can

separate P1 from P2 and t3 in the profit function. It is easy to see that the profit function is a concave function of P1 . The necessary conditions for maximizing  (t3 , P1 , P2 ) are 35

d (t3 ,P1 ,P2 )  |P 1 dP1

= 0, and

d (t3 ,P1 ,P2 )  |P 2 dP2

= 0 respectively.

At first, the first derivative of  (t3 , P1 , P2 ) with respect to P1 is d (t3 , P1 , P2 ) 1 = [D1 (P1 )t1 + P1 D1 (P1 )t1 - CD1 (P1 ) dP1 T

On the right hand side of Equation (4.3), D1 (P1 ) > 0 and D1 (P1 ) < 0. Therefore, the components in the first braces are always positive and the components in the second
 braces are always negative. By the iteration method, one can find out the value of P1  from Equation (4.3), which satisfies f (P1 ) = 0.

In addition, the sufficient condition is that the total profit function needs to be concave and must satisfy
d2  (P1 ,t3 ,P2 )  |P1 =P1 2 dP1

< 0. So taking the second derivative of  (P1 , t3 , P2 )

 with respect to P1 and substituting P1 = P1 .

In Equation (4.4), we know D1 (P1 ) < 0 and D1 (P1 ) > 0. As a result, the value in the first braces is always negative and the value in the second braces is positive. However, the first value is significantly greater than the second one. Consequently,

(4.5)

Using the same argument as we did in previous chapter for the two­market model of partial backlogging case with time dependent demand, we know that f (t3 ) = 0 has a unique optimal solution such that t 3  (t2 , T ) and market selling price is given.
  Once the optimal value of t 3 is obtained, the profit  (t3 |P1 , P2 ) can be found by  substituting optimal t 3 , P1 and the given P2 in Equation (4.1). d2  (t 3 |P1 ,P2 ) 2 dt 3

According to Equation (4.7), D2 (P2 ) > 0 and D2 (P2 ) < 0. Therefore, Equation (4.7) has some negative and positive terms. So using the iteration method one can find the
    for the given optimal time t value of P2 3 , which satisfies f (P2 |t3 , P1 ) = 0.

Now the solutions to Equations (4.5) and (4.7) must satisfy the second order conditions for a local maximum. So the second derivative of the profit function with respect

This means that the profit function is strictly concave. In conclusion, we can say that the
 stationary points (t 3 , P2 ) is the global maximum solution to the problem of maximizing   the total profit. Now substituting t 3 , P1 and P2 in Equation (4.1), we can calculate the

One­Market Model with Discounting

The inventory profile of one­market model with discounting follows the pattern which is shown in Figure 3.3. Before discounting demand is D1 (P1 ) and after discounting demand is Dd (Pd ). It is assumed, before discounting the selling price in this one­market model is 41

 as same as the optimally determined selling price P1 of the two­market model. And the

discounted selling price Pd is determined such that the total profit of this one­market with discounting model can be as same as the total profit of a two­market model. The
 optimal time at which inventory level goes to zero, t 3 , the optimal order quantity, Q ,

and the optimal backlogged quantity, B  are also determined.

In order to determine optimal time t 3 at which inventory level becomes zero, we take the first derivative of the total profit function with respect to t3 , which is:
 d (t3 , P1 , Pd ) Dd (Pd ) Pd C = [Pd - - Cet3 + dt3 T 1 +  (T - t3 ) 1 +  (T - t3 ) t3   (C2 + C3  )(T - t3 )  -het3 e-t dt - C1 {et3 - 1} + ] = 0. 1 +  (T - t3 ) 0

(4.15)

In Equation (4.15), t3 and Pd are two unknown variables. So for a given Pd , solve Equation (4.15) and determine optimal value of t 3 . Consequently it has been shown in one­market with discounting model for time dependent demand that
d2  (t 3 ,P1 ,Pd ) 2 dt 3

< 0 for

a given Pd (Pd > C ). Then, by solving Equations (4.15) and (4.14) simultaneously, one can determine the discounted selling price Pd , which can result in the same profit as in the two­market model. 42

One­Market Model

The inventory profile follows the pattern which is shown in Figure 3.4. Let Do (Po ) be the demand rate for the one­market model where Po is the selling price, which is not optimally determined. Po is determined such that the total profit obtained from this model is as same as that of the two­market model. The optimal time at which inventory level

(4.18)

In Equation (4.18), t3 and Po are two unknown variables. So for a given Po , Equation (4.18) is solved to determine optimal value of t 3 . Consequently, it is shown in one­market model of time dependent demand that
d2  (t 3 ,Po ) 2 dt 3

< 0 for a given Po (Po > C ). Thus, by

solving Equations (4.17) and (4.18) simultaneously, one can determine a selling price Po , which can result in the same profit as in the two­market model.

Chapter 5 Examples and Sensitivity Analysis for Time­Dependent Demand
In this chapter, numerical examples are presented for the models developed in chapter 3. To illustrate the models numerically, the following parameter values are considered: holding cost h = $2 per unit per unit time, deterioration cost C1 = $1 per unit, backorder cost C2 = $32 per unit, opportunity cost due to lost sale C3 = $35 per unit, transportation cost C4 = $0.5 per unit, time proportional constant for backlogging  = 0.1, purchasing cost C = $30 per unit, scale parameter  = 0.3, shape parameter  = 2, and cycle time T = 1.

5.1

Two­Market model:

The high­end market demand D1 (t) is expressed as D1 (t) = a1 + b1 t, where a1 = 700 and b1 = 10. The low­end market demand D2 (t) is expressed as D2 (t) = a2 + b2 t, where a2 = 900 and b2 = 20. At time t1 = 0.41, the leftover inventory is transferred from the high­end market to the low­end market and the transportation time is t2 - t1 =0.011. The high­end market selling price is P1 = $50 per unit and the low­end market selling price is P2 = $45 per unit. 46

5.1.1

Partial Backlogging

First, the optimal time t 3 is determined iteratively by using Equation (3.28). Initially, for example, substitute t3 = 0.86 in Equation (3.28): f (0.86) = 0.6213 - 6.3365 - 0.982 - 0.1007 - 0.3948 + 4.9014 = -2.294. Then, the value of t3 is decreased until it satisfies the condition f (t3 ) = 0. Figure 5.1 shows, t 3 = 0.8201 satisfies that condition. Figure 5.2 also shows that the total profit is a concave function on t3 and the maximum total profit is at t3 = 0.8201.

Figure 5.1: The optimal value at which inventory becomes zero with time­dependent demand and partial backlogging

Second, the optimal total profit per year, optimal order quantity, and optimal backlogged quantity are calculated with t 3 = 0.8201. The optimal profit per year is equal to the optimal sales revenue minus the optimal total cost. Hence, the optimal total cost is calculated using Equation (3.24) as follows:  c (0.8201) = 1 [Pc + Hc + Uc + Mc + Bc + Lc ] = $27946 per unit time. T 47

Next, in order to study the sensitivity to change in the input parameters C , h, ,  , C1 , C2 , C3 , C4 , and  on the optimal time in which the inventory becomes zero, t 3 , optimal order quantity, Q , optimal backlogged quantity, B  , optimal total cost,  c , and optimal total profit,   , the sensitivity analysis of the two­market model for partial backlogging is studied by changing one parameter at a time while keeping the remaining parameters at their original value.

The following characteristics are observed from Table 5.1 1. The total cost increases and total profit decreases with an increase in the value of all cost parameters (C, h, C1 , C2 , C3 , C4 ). In order to increase the profit, these costs should be reduced.
  2. When the value of C increases, the total cost and B  increase while t 3 , Q , and 

decrease. The obtained results show that the total profit and total cost are highly sensitive to change in the value of C . When C = 45, the profit is negative, because purchase cost per unit should be less than the selling price per unit. 3. If holding cost increases, one tries to hold less inventory, hence Q decreases. This
 decreases t 3 and increases B . Consequently, the total cost increases and the profit

50

decreases. 4. Deterioration cost increases with an increase in the value of deterioration parameter . As a result, the total cost increases and the total profit decreases with an increase in the value of . 5. Q and B  decrease as  increases. Hence, the total cost decreases and the total profit increases. 6. When deterioration cost C1 increases, one will hold less inventory. Therefore, t 3 and Q decrease while B  increases with an increase in C1 . 7. When backorder and opportunity costs increase, more amount of inventory will be
  hold to reduce the costs. As a result, t 3 and Q increase and B decreases with an

increase in C2 and C3 . 8. The value of  is the proportion of customers who do not want to accept their demand to be backlogged. Increasing the value of  will increase the total cost and decrease the optimal profit, hence, maximum profit occurs at  = 0 and minimum profit occurs at  = .

5.1.2

Complete Backlogging

Our objective is to determine the optimal time t3 that maximizes the total profit. Let t3 = 0.85 and then f (0.85) = -36.5161 + 30 - 1.853 - 0.089 - 0.3317 + 6.02 = -2.7698. Now, the value of t3 is decreased, until it satisfies the condition f (t 3 ) = 0. Figure 5.3
 shows that t 3 = 0.8 satisfies f (t3 ) = 0 and Figure 5.4 shows the profit function is a

concave function on t3 and the maximum total profit is at t3 = 0.8. 51

Figure 5.3: The optimal time at which inventory becomes zero with time­dependent demand and complete backlogging
  Once t 3 is determined, the optimal total cost, c , optimal sales revenue, SR , optimal

total profit,   , optimal order quantity, Q , and optimal backlogged quantity, B  , are calculated, respectively. Hence, the optimal total cost per unit time  c (0.80) = 1 [Pc + Hc + Uc + Mc + Bc + Lc ] = $27939 per unit time. T

= 183.60 units. If we compare complete and partial backlogging, we can see that total profit of the complete backlogging is usually greater than that of the partial backlogging. Because, in partial backlogging, some percentages of demand are lost and opportunity cost is added due to lost sales. However, in complete backlogging, all demands are backlogged with no lost sales. For complete backlogging case, the sensitivity of the input parameters are studied and the results are given in Table 5.2

5.2

One­Market Model with Discounting

All parameters are the same as in the two­market model. The only difference is that the selling price is discounted at time t1 without transporting the items to the low­end 54

market. From time 0 to t1 , demand, D1 (t) = 700 + 10t, and selling price, P1 = 50, are the same as in the high­end market of the two­market model. In this model, after time t1 , demand is Dd (t) = ad + bd t, where ad = 905 and bd = 20, and discounted selling price is Pd , which will be determined by obtaining the same profit as in the two­market model.

5.2.1

Partial Backlogging

In order to determine the discounted selling price Pd , we apply the following algorithm: Algorithm 1 ^d = Pd , where C < P ^d < P1 . 1. Start with P ^ 2. Determine the optimal time t 3 by substituting Pd in Equation (3.45). Using this
 t 3 , calculate the total profit  (t3 ) of the one­market model with discounting from

Equation (3.44). 3. Calculate the total profit  (t 3 ) of the two­market model from Equation (3.26). If the profit from Equation (3.44) is equal to the profit from Equation (3.26), go to step 5; otherwise go to step 4. ^d and go to step 2. 4. Initialize another P 5. Stop and take this Pd as the discounted selling price of the one­market model with discounting. From Equation (3.26), we get the optimal profit of the two­market model as $10297 per ^ unit time. In order to determine t 3 , we start with Pd = 43.800 in Equation (3.45) and we obtain t 3 = 0.7767 as follows: f (0.7767) = 44 - 43.0394 - 35.9534 + 29.3450 - 1.7496 - 2.0967 + 2 + 7.7504 = 0.0041  0.

55

^d = 43.800 in Equation (3.44), we obtain total profit Then, substituting t3 = 0.7767 and P of the one­market model with discounting  (t3 ) = $10145 < $10297. Now, we increase ^d as shown in Table 5.3. For Pd = 44.052, we obtain that profit from the value of P the one­market model with discounting is the same as the profit from the two­market
 model. Hence, optimal time t 3 = 0.7773, the optimal total profit  = $10297 per unit

time, the optimal order quantity Q = 880.33 units, and the optimal backlogged quantity B  = 203.35 units.

5.2.2

Complete Backlogging

In Section 5.1.2, we obtain the optimal profit of $10371 per unit time for the two­market model with complete backlogging. Now, we use the iterative method to find Pd for complete backlogging. The summary of the iteration is given in Table 5.6. The optimal solution at which inventory becomes zero does not depend on selling price for complete backlogging. As a result, the optimal time t 3 = 0.7585 remains the same with changing the discounted selling price. We also calculate the optimal order quantity Q = 878.05 units, and the optimal backlogged quantity B  = 222.80 units. Next, in order to investigate how the discounted price in the one­market model behaves with respect to prices in high­end and low­end markets in the two­market model, 56

Table 5.4: Discounted selling price for time­dependent demand with completel backlogging No 1 2 3 4 5 t3 0.7585 0.7585 0.7585 0.7585 0.7585 Pd 43.30 43.50 43.70 43.90 44.04 Total profit 9992.0 10157 10212 10304 10371

we determine the total profit of the two­market model for different selling prices in both high­end and low­end markets, and then we also determine the corresponding discounted selling price in the one­market model. Figures 5.5 and 5.6 show that when the profit in the one­market model is the same as that of the two­market model, discounted selling price is less than that of both high­end market and low­end market. One way to explain this behavior is that the total cost of the two­market model is greater than that of the one­market model with discounting, because of transportation. This helps to offer a discounted selling price, which is less than that of the high­end and low-end markets in the two­market model.

Finally, there is a fundamental problem when dealing with deteriorating items. The longer time one keeps the inventory, the more products deteriorate. Consequently, discount pricing strategy is used to increase the demand. However, one has to decide when to discount the price and by how much. Therefore, we investigate the relationship between the discounted selling price and the time to introduce the discount. In Figure 5.7, at each and every points profit is the same. This figure shows that if one offers discount early, the items can be sold at a higher discounted price. As time passes the value of 57

Figure 5.5: Relationships among high­end, low­end, and discounted selling prices for partial backlogging

Figure 5.6: Relationships among high­end, low­end, and discounted selling prices for complete backlogging

the items drop very sharply because of deterioration. This figure indicates that there is a critical time that makes the difference in the discounted price. After that critical time discounted selling price does not change much and becomes constant. This indicates that each item has its lowest selling price to make the business profitable. Hence, one is not able to offer discount beyond that selling price.

58

5.3

One­Market Model

Demand for the one­market without discounting is assumed to be Do (t) = ao + bo t, where ao = 800, and bo = 20 and the rest of the input parameters remain same as in the two­ market model. The objective is to determine the selling price which leads to the same profit as in the two­market model.

5.3.1

Partial Backlogging

The objective is to determine the selling price, Po , that can result in the same profit as in the two­market model. To determine Po the algorithm 1 is applied, which is presented in Section 5.2.1. Table 5.5 shows the summary of the iterations. The selling price
 Po = $46.77, the optimal time t 3 = 0.77811, the optimal order quantity Q = 846.26

units, and the optimal backlogged quantity B  = 179.45 units. 59

Complete Backlogging

To determine Po , an iterative method is applied. Table 5.6 shows that, Po = $46.751 per unit that can generate the profit of $10371, which is the profit in the two­market model with complete backlogging. Hence, the optimal time t 3 = 0.7612, the optimal order quantity Q = 845.66 units, and the optimal order quantity B  = 195.24 units.

Now, in order to investigate the behaviour of the selling price of one­market model with respect to high­end and low­end market selling prices in the two­market model, 60

we determine the total profit of the two­market model for different selling prices in both high­end and low­end markets. Then, we determine corresponding selling price of one­ market model. Figures 5.8 and 5.9 show that the selling price of one­market model is less than high­end market selling price but greater than low­end market selling price when the profit in the one­market model is the same as that of two­market model. For one­market model, the same selling price is continued through the whole cycle time. This hepls to offer a selling price, which is greater than the low­end market selling price but less than the high­end market selling price in the two­market model.

Chapter 6 Examples and Sensitivity Analysis for Price­Dependent Demand
In this chapter, numerical examples are presented for the models which are developed in Chapter 4. To illustrate the models numerically, the following parameter values are considered: holding cost h = $3 per unit per unit time, cycle time T = 0.25, and other parameters are assumed same as the previous time­dependent demand model.

6.1

Two­Market Model

-b1 The high­end market demand D1 (P1 ) = a1 P1 , where a1 = 7 × 107 and b1 = 3.2. The -b2 low­end market demand D2 (P2 ) = a2 P2 , where a2 = 8 × 109 and b2 = 3.9. At time

t1 = 0.1, the leftover inventory is transferred from the high­end market to low­end market and the transportation time t2 - t1 = 0.011.

6.1.1

Partial Backlogging

In the total profit function t3 , P1 , and P2 are three unknown variables. At first, the
 is determined by the iterative method optimal selling price of the high­end market P1

62

from Equation (4.3). Initially, substitute P1 = 65 in Equation (4.3): f (65) =11.0605 + 16.3519 + 0.1099 + 2.1988 - 2.1966 - 40.3936 = -12.8691. Then, the value of P1 is decreased until it satisfies the condition f (P1 ) = 0. Figure
 = 44.632 satisfies the optimal condition. 6.1 shows, P1

Figure 6.1: The optimal value of P1 for partial backlogging

 Now, the optimal values of t 3 and P2 are determined by solving Equations (4.5) and

(4.7) simutaneously. To solve these two equations, the following algorithm is applied.

Algorithm 2
1. Start with P2 value, where, P2 > C . 2. For the current P2 , solve f (t3 ) = 0 from Equation (4.5) and denote the optimal ^ solution by t 3. ^ 3. Let t3 =t 3 solve f (P2 ) = 0 from Equation (4.7). Let the solution to (4.7) be the current P2 . The objective function value of  (t3 , P1 , P2 ) should change in step 63

2. Similarly, when f (t3 ) = 0 is solved for current P2 ,  (t3 , P1 , P2 ) should change. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no change is seen in the objective function value of  (t3 , P1 , P2 ). Applying Algorithm 2, after some iterations we obtain the optimal time t 3 = 0.215
 = 40.26. and the optimal selling price of the low­end market P2  Figure 6.2 indicates the total profit per unit time  (P2 |t 3 , P1 ) is strictly concave in   P2 and Figure 6.3 shows the total profit per unit time  (t3 |P1 , P2 ) is strictly concave

function in t3 . Consequently, we are sure that the local maximum solution t 3 = 0.215
 and P2 = 40.26 are the global maximum solution for maximizing total profit.

 Figure 6.2: Graphical representation of  (P2 |t 3 , P1 )

Therefore, the optimal total profit per year, optimal order quantity, and optimal back  logged quantity are calculated as t 3 = 0.215, P1 = 44.632, and P2 = 40.26. We obtain  the optimal total cost  c = $70322 per year and the optimal sales revenue SR = $94410

per year. 64

  Figure 6.3: Graphical representation of  (t3 |P1 , P2 )

    Therefore, the optimal total profit,  (t 3 , P1 , P2 ) = (SR - c )

= ($94410 - $70322) = $24088per unit time. The optimal order quantity Q is: Q

The following characteristics are observed from Table 6.1 1. Selling prices for both markets increase with the value of cost parameters (C, h, C1 ). Consequently, demand decreases due to high selling price, which leads to decrease in the total profit as well as the total cost.
   2. The obtained results show that, P1 , P2 ,  c ,  are highly sensitive to change in the

value of C . The selling prices highly depend on the purchase cost. For a lower purchase cost, one can offer a lower selling price. And this lower selling price can generate more selling rate and more total profit. 3. The total profit and the total cost decrease, however, selling prices of the high­end and the low­end markets increase with the value of .
    4. P1 and P2 decrease as  increases. Hence, t 3 , c , and  increase in  .

5. The high­end market selling price does not change with the backorder cost C2 , the opportunity cost C3 or the backlogging parameter  , because shortage does not occur at the high­end market. As a result, if C2 , C3 or  increases, only the low­end market selling price increases.

6.1.2

Complete Backlogging

For complete backlogging case, the optimal selling price of the high­end market will be as same as in partial backlogging because backlogged occurs only at the low­end market. 67

In order to determine the optimal time t 3 , we initialize t3 = 0.24: f (t3 = 0.24) = -0.4138 - 0.7283 - 0.0069 - 0.0276 + 0.32 - 0.8566. Now, the value of t3 is decreased until it satisfies the condition f (t 3 ) = 0. Figure 6.4 shows that t3 = 0.2184 satisfies that condition. Then, using this optimal value of t 3 , the optimal value of P2 is determined. To determine the optimal value of P2 , we initialize P2 = 50. However, f (P2 = 50) = -130.25340, which is not equal to zero.

Figure 6.4: The optimal time at which inventory becomes zero with price­dependent demand and complete backlogging

 ) = 0. Figure Now the value of P2 is decreased until it satisfies the condition f (P2

(6.5) shows that P2 = 40.15 satisfies the optimal condition.
   Once t 3 , P1 , and P2 are determined, the optimal total cost, c , optimal sales revenue,

SR , the optimal total profit,   , the optimal order quantity, Q , and the optimal backlogged quantity B  are calculated, respectively. The optimal total cost  c = $81701 per unit time and the optimal sales revenue SR = $106710 per unit time. 68

One­Market Model with Discounting

-b1 From time 0 to t1 , demand, D1 (P1 ) = a1 P1 , where a1 = 7 × 107 and b1 = 3.2, are the

same as in the high­end market of two­market model and P1 is the same as the optimally determined selling price of the high­end market of the two­market model. After time t1 ,
-bd , where ad = 7 × 109 , bd = 3.9, and Pd is the discounted selling demand Dd (Pd ) = ad Pd

price, which will be detemined to obtain the same profit as in the two­market model. All parameters are the same as in the two­market model. The only difference is at time t1 , a discount on selling price is offered instead of transporting the items from the high­end market to the low­end market.

6.2.1

Partial Backlogging

In order to determine the discounted selling peice Pd , Algorithm 1 is applied. Table 6.3 shows, for Pd = $40.87, we obtain that the profit from the one­market model with discounting is the same as the profit from the two­market model. Hence, the optimal
 time, t 3 = 0.21802, the total order quantity, Q = 595.66 units, and the total backlogged

quantity, B  = 118.40 units. Table 6.3: Discounted selling price for price­dependent demand with partial backlogging No 1 2 3 4 5 t3 0.21750 0.21770 0.21782 0.21795 0.21802 Pd 38.00 38.50 39.00 39.50 40.87 Total profit 22910 23331 23600 23805 24088

Complete Backlogging

The optimal total profit is $25009 per unit time for the two­market model with complete backlogging. In order to determine the discounted selling price Pd , we apply an iterative method. The summery of the iteration is given in Tabel 6.4. The discounted selling price, Pd = $40.55, the optimal time, t 3 = 0.2035, the total order quantity, Q = 695.84 units, and the total backlogged quantity, B = 202.48 units. Now, we investigate the relationship Table 6.4: Discounted selling price for price­dependent demand with complete backlogging No 1 2 3 4 5 t3 0.2035 0.2035 0.2035 0.2035 0.2035 Pd 38.85 39.00 39.45 39.85 40.55 Total profit 24344 24469 24587 24662 25009

between the discounting time and discounted selling price for price­dependent demand. In Figure 6.6, at each point the profit is the same. This Figure shows that, if one offers discount early, items can be sold at a lower discounted price. If one delays the discount, the items are sold at a higher price for a longer period, and in price-dependent demand that has a reverse effect on profit because of decrease in demand rate. As a result, the discounted price increases very sharply with an increase in discounting time. This figure indicates that there is a critical time that makes the difference in the discounted selling price. After that time, the discounted selling price does not change much and becomes constant. This indicates that no one is interested in buying the old items beyond a certain discounted selling price.

One­Market Model

-b Demand for the one­market model is Do (Po ) = ao Po , where ao = 5 × 109 and bo = 3.9

and the rest of the input parameters remain as same as in the two­market model. The aim is to determine the selling price Po that results in the same profit as in the two­market model.

6.3.1

Partial Backlogging

In order to determine Po , we apply Algorithm 1 which is presented in Section 5.2.1. Table 6.5 shows the summary of the iterations. From Section 6.1.1, we obtain the optimal selling
 = $44.632 and the optimal selling price of low­end market price of high­end market P1  = $40.26, which results in the optimal total profit   = $24088 per unit time. Table P2

6.5 shows, for Po = $42.87, we obtain the same total profit, which implies the selling price of one­market model is less than the high­end market selling price but greater than the low­end market selling price in the two­market model. In addition, the optimal order quantity, Q = 507.93 units, and the optimal backlogged quantity, B  = 101.17 units. 73

For complete backlogging, Table 6.6 shows that, for Po = $42.23, we obtain the same profit as in the two­market model.

Chapter 7 Conclusion
The contribution of this thesis is developing EOQ models considering a two­market model, price­dependent demand, time­dependent demand, complete backlogging, and partial backlogging. In this thesis, three different EOQ models are developed for both time­dependent demand and price­dependent demand. The first EOQ model is developed for two different markets (high­end market and low­end market). In this model the items are first sold at the high­end market at a higher price for a given period of time and then the leftover inventory is transferred to a low­end market where the items are sold at a lower price. At the low­end market, when the inventory becomes zero, the demand is backlogged either partially or completely. The second EOQ model is developed to generate the same amount of profit that is obtained from the first EOQ model, but the items are sold only at the high­end market and the price is discounted after a certain time. When the inventory becomes zero, the demand is backlogged either partially or completely. The third EOQ model is developed to generate the same amount of profit that is obtained from the first EOQ model; however, the items are sold only at the high­end market without any price discount. When the inventory becomes zero, the demand is backlogged either partially or completely. It has been proved that there exists an optimal time at which inventory becomes 75

zero, and the total profit is a concave function in all scenarios investigated. It has been shown that the discounted price in the second EOQ model is lower than the price at the high-end market and the price at the low-end market. Furthermore, the relationship between discounted price and time of discounting has been investigated, and it is shown that there is a critical time that makes a difference in the discounted price. This research can be extended by considering stock­dependent demand and also stochastic demand.
