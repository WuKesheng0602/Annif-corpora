I authorize Ryerson University to lend this thesis to other institutions or individuals for the purpose of scholarly research.

The objective of this study was to develop an air I further authorize Ryerson University to reproduce this thesis or dissertation by photocopying or by other means, in total or in part, at the request of other institutions on individuals for the purpose of scholarly research. This thesis begins with a review of existing atmospheric dispersion models, specifically, the Gaussian Plume models and their capabilities to handle the atmospheric chemistry of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxides (S02). It also includes a review of wet deposition in the form of in-cloud, below-cloud, and snow scavenging. Existing dispersion models are investigated to assess their capability of representing atmospheric chemistry, specifically in the context of NOx and S0 2x substances and their applications to urban areas. A review was completed of previous studies where Gaussian dispersion models were applied to major cities around the world such as London, Helsinki, Kanto, and Prague, to predict ground level concentrations ofNOx and S02. dispersion model and demonstrate that it can be successfully used in place of or in conjunction with ambient air monitoring stations in determining the local Air Quality Index (AQI).

For the purpose of this thesis, a Gaussian air dispersion model was developed, known as the Air dispersion model for the Road Sources in Urban areaS (ARSUS) model, which is capable of predicting ground level concentrations for a contaminant of interest. The ARSUS model was

concentrations were then compared to the Toronto West ambient air monitoring station.

ARSUS model's results indicate that air quality in the immediate vicinity of roads or highways is highly impacted by the tailpipe emissions. Higher concentrations are observed for the areas adjacent to the road and highway sources. The tailpipe emissions of CO from highways have a higher contribution to the local air quality.

The predicted ground level concentrations from the ARSUS model do under-predict when compared to the observed data from the monitoring station; however, despite this a predictive model is viable.

ABSTRACT

Air quality is a major concern for the public. Therefore, the reliability in modeling and predicting the air quality accurately is of a major interest. This study reviews existing atmospheric dispersion models, specifically, the Gaussian Plume models and their capabilities to handle the atmospheric chemistry of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxides (802). It also includes a review of wet deposition in Existing dispersion

models are investigated to assess their capability of handling atmospheric chemistry, specifically in the context of NOx and 80 2 substances and their applications to urban areas. A number of previous studies have been conducted where Gaussian dispersion model was applied to major cities around the world such as London, Helsinki, Kanto, and Prague, to predict ground level concentrations of NOx and 802. These studies demonstrated a good agreement between the modeled and observed ground level concentrations of NOx and 802. Toronto, Ontario, Canada is also a heavily populated urban area where a dispersion model could be applied to evaluate ground level concentrations of various contaminants to better understand the air quality. This paper also

includes a preliminary study of road emissions for a segment of the city of Toronto and its busy streets during morning and afternoon rush hours. results of the modeling are compared to the observed data. The

various wet deposition such as in cloud, below cloud, and snow.
Since 1999, each air quality study completed states that the air quality in Ontario is improving [1218]. In 2005, the Ontario Medical Association (OMA) announced air pollution costs were estimated to be $507,000,000 in direct health care costs [1 ]. The OMA deems the cost to be an underestimate and a better understanding of air pollution and its effect on human health is required. In the past few years, a number of air initiatives have been established by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment (MOE). The initiatives include recently improved means of how the state of air quality is reported to the general public, the implementation of new regulations and mandates to reduce industrial emissions, and the review of the air quality standards for the province. For many that live in and around the Great Toronto Area (GTA), checking the AQI became a daily routine [19). In recent years, AQI was reported to public using a new scale with a range of 1 to 100, good to very poor, respectively. Along with the quantitative scale, AQIIists the primary contaminant of greatest impact on human health which results in a poor air quality. Furthermore, the public is provided with a brief summary warning of how the pollutants affect vulnerable population so that necessary precautions may be undertaken. At the present time, the Ministry of the Environment utilizes data from Environment Canada's Canadian Regional and Hemispheric Ozone and NOx System (CHRONOS), NOAA's WRF/CHEM and NOAA-EPA NCEP/AQFS models to forecast air quality for the City of Toronto [20). The primary objective is to forecast smog episodes. The AQI information is obtained via a network of 44 ambient air monitoring stations and 444 municipalities across Ontario [12) and [21 ]. In addition to improving public communication on the status of the air quality, the MOE established a set of new regulations targeting industries with the direct objectives to reduce emissions. Since the early 70's, the MOE established a permitting system that set ground level limits. All industrial emitters were required by law, Section 9 of Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA) , to utilize an air dispersion model (Appendix A: Ontario Regulation 346 (O.Reg. 346)) and site specific emissions to demonstrate compliance against set ground level concentrations for the contaminants of interest. With time, the tools used to demonstrate compliance were clearly becoming out of date [22). As the regulation aged , limitations began to slow the approval process and prevent certain applicants from obtaining permission to conduct work. It became apparent that in order to address the public concern , i.e., poor air quality, and pressure from industry, the MOE began to look into alternative solutions. In the 90's, the MOE introduced a number of alternative permits and an Environmental Leaders program. The new permits (i.e. streamline review, the use of conditions in permits, and the comprehensive permits) were becoming ineffective as shown by the internal review of MOE's work. Specifically, work was conducted by Standards Compliance Branch (SCB) , former Environmental SWAT Team, and Selected Targets Air Compliance (STAG) department. The SCB's work on regular basis demonstrated that approximately 60% of an industrial sector was found to be in non-compliance with provincial regulations [23) . The Environmental Leaders program is a program where companies are invited to sign up and are included under following conditions [24]: a) commitment to voluntary reduction of emissions; and b) making production and emission data available to the public. In exchange, Environmental Leaders program members are promised: a) the public acknowledgement in MOE's publications; and b) the recognition on the Ministry's web site.

1. INTRODUCTION
Over the past few years , the smog days in Ontario, Canada have been steadily increasing. Overall, longer smog episodes are observed with occurrences outside of the regular smog season. Air pollution limits the enjoyment of the outdoors and increases the cost of the health care [1] and [2] . To combat this problem , the Ontario Ministry of Environment (MOE) introduced new tools to reduce emissions as well as improved communication with the public on the state of the air quality. The communication policy has been implemented by the introduction of an Air Quality Index (AQI) based on actual pollutant concentrations reported by various monitoring stations across Ontario. One major concern is the spatial distribution of pollutants not captured by monitoring stations. To further enhance the understanding of pollution in an urban area, studies involving computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for street canyons , the land use regression (LUR) , and the use of dispersion models have been conducted [3] . For a number of cities across the world dispersion models were applied to urban areas to understand pollution in a given city [4), [5) , [6) , [7] and [8]. The objective of these studies was to develop new air quality standards. These studies compared modeled ground level concentrations of NOx, S0 2 , and CO to the monitored data and showed a good agreement between observed and predicted data. Therefore, the main objectives of this study are to review the developments of Gaussian dispersion model, to review the dispersion modeling applied to urban areas, and to conduct a small scale test for the city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Over the years , the dispersion models have been used by the policy makers to develop air quality standards, an approach applicable to the city of Toronto , Ontario, Canada [1 O) and [11 ). In 2005, fifteen smog advisories, a record number covering 53 days, were issued during smog season [12) in Toronto , Ontario, Canada. This is also a record number of days covering smog since the start of the Smog Alert Program in Ontario in 2002. Even more prominent was an episode that lasted 5 days in February 2005 and occurred outside smog season due to elevated levels of particulate matt~r with dia~eter less than 2.5 micrometers (PM 2 .5 ) followed by the earliest smog advisory ever 1ssued dunng the normal smog season in April , 2005. As shown in Table 1, there has been an increase in smog advisories since 2002 [12), [13) , [14) and [15].

Currently, there are nine members listed on the MOE's website [24]. As stated by the Industrial Pollution Team, the program was not effective in Ontario [24]. The report prepared by the Industrial Pollution Team specifically addresses the need to update tools (i.e. air dispersion Poor air quality, aging permitting system, and models) utilized in the permitting process. industries not committing to reduce emissions resulted in an overhaul of the system by implementation of the following new regulations: 1. Ontario Regulation 419/05, entitled "Air Pollution - Local Air Quality", (O.Reg. 419/05) replaced O.Reg. 346 allowing companies to utilize new dispersion models: Industrial Source Complex- Short Term Model [Version 3]-Piume Rise Model Enhancements (ISCPRIME), the American Meteorological Society/Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model Improvement Committee's Dispersion Model (AERMOD) along with the establishment of new air standards [25]; 2. Ontario Regulation 127/01, entitled "Airborne Contaminant Discharge Monitoring and Reporting", (O.Reg. 127/01) which is an annual emissions reporting program due by June · 1st each year [26]; 3. Data from annual reporting programs was utilized to implement Ontario Regulation 194/05, entitled "Industrial Emissions - Nitrogen Oxides and Sulphur Dioxide", (O.Reg. 194) which caps NOx and SOx emissions of very specific industries with set reduction targets [27]. The targets are intensity based. For industries that do not meet their targets, options of trading or paying for the emissions exist; 4. On the federal level, a National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI), a program similar to O.Reg. 127/01 which requires industries to submit an annual emissions report by June 1st each year [28]; 5. On the federal level, Canadian Environmental Protection Act Section 71 (CEPA S. 71) requires for specific industries, as identified within the reporting requirement, to submit annual emissions by May 31 due [29] with the objective to set future targets that will lower annual emissions. Due May 31st 2008 are the annual2006 values; and 6. On the federal level, a Greenhouse Gases Release (GHG) inventory was introduced for larger emitters (> 100 ktonnes/year) of C0 2 which requires annual reporting. (30] With the rise of the poor air quality in Ontario that causes high health cots, the MOE began to update its 30 year old system. This improvement is coming about in forms of various new regulations with objectives to reduce overall emissions. The current reforms and expansion of regulations within the province of Ontario have a goal in common to reduce emissions that have a health impact. Other Canadian provinces such as British Columbia [31] and Alberta [32] are also undergoing reforms to improve their air quality. These provinces are moving to implement advanced air dispersion models to study the air quality. The annual air quality studies, new regulations, and air standards all published by the MOE do not link together at the present time. The AQI warnings issued to the public in most cases are based on readings from one monitoring station within a region [33]. Uniform air quality across the municipality of interest is the main assumption undertaken with the AQI warnings. Data used to establish the AQI is not processed or reviewed for quality control [33]. Historical data, statistical analysis, decay rate, or predicted future quality of air is not provided. Data used to establish the AQI undergoes minimal review for quality control [33]. Both assumptions of uniformity and minimal quality check have been recognized in the most recent Environmental Commissioner of Ontario report [34] as providing a "false sense of security". The AQI notification program can be refined by completing air dispersion modeling for a city. This approach incorporates a reduced gird size, utilization of local meteorological conditions , input of actual emissions from surround sources, and predicted concentration contours at various time frames, i.e., sub hourly and hourly, to better represent the state of air quality within the area of interest. There are a number of similar approaches currently conducted in other countries [4], [5], [6], [7], [8] and [9], of which all share the same objective to utilize air dispersion models for a city and use the information to understand air quality and provide information to develop air quality standards for that city.

In order to understand the limitations of the air dispersion models, next section provides an overview of the Gaussian Plume model. Subsequently, a discussion follows with a review of standard methods applied to handle dry and wet deposition specifically in box models. This is followed by a review of other wet deposition (i.e. in-cloud, below cloud , and snow scavenging) not necessarily already implemented in box models. Section 4 takes the knowledge from previous discussion and concentrates on how the dispersion models have been applied up to date to urban areas with a review of five studies. The studies show that Gaussian dispersion model should be used to urban areas and yields good results. Finally, in our own study, a small scale study was conducted for the city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, utilizing local meteorological and traffic data. This is a preliminary study which confirms Gaussian dispersion could be applied to the city of Toronto and it can be expanded to include other factors, such as wet deposition, scavenging, and reactions, in the model.

2. CURRENT AIR DISPERSION MODELS
The atmospheric dispersion modeling has been an area of interest for a long time. In the past, the limitation of studying atmospheric dispersion was limited to the data processing. The original dispersion models addressed very specific situations such as a set of screen models (SCREEN3, TSCREEN, VISCREEN etc.) containing generated meteorological conditions which were not based on measured data. There are also models which apply to specific solution, a single With the scenario such as point source (ADAM), spill (AFTOX), and road (CALINE3). advancement of computing power, the box type of air dispersion models became widely available (ISC-PRIME, AEMOD, CALPUFF). The advantage of the box type models is not only being readily available in most cases but also is capable of handling multiple emission sources. At the present time, the most of the box dispersion models are under the management of the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) [35]. Many of these box models are widely used in other countries and recently a number of environmental governing bodies set these air dispersion models on the preferred list [25], [31], [32] and [36] The box models allow the user to enter information about meteorology, emission sources, and in some instances topography. The information is processed by the box models to provide concentrations of the pollutant of interest. With the recent expansion of computing speeds and the ability to handle large data, dispersion modeling has been expanded. In many cases, the models are used to simulate urban areas or emergency situations. The new tools allow for the evaluation of past events and the prediction of future events such as poor air quality days (i.e. smog) in the cities. This study concentrates on the revaluation of such dispersion model, Plume model and its capability to handle atmospheric chemistry, specifically how the chemistry of NOx and S0 2 contaminants have been treated in a Gaussian Plume model for an urban area.

2.1. Gaussian Dispersion Model The concepts of the Gaussian Plume model, dispersion coefficients, characterization of sources (i.e. volume, line, and area sources), limitations of the model, and the capabilities to handle atmospheric chemistry are discussed in this section. The discussion revolves around concepts that apply to urban type of sources. 2.1.1. Basic Gaussian Plume Model Between the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a bell-shaped distribution called "Gaussiandistribution" was derived by De Moivre, Gauss, and Laplace [37]. Experiments conducted by Shlien and Corrsin [38] related to dispersion of a plume related Gaussian behaviour. This discovery has since been used to provide a method of predicting the turbulent dispersion of air pollutants in the atmosphere. The basic Gaussian Plume is as follows [37]:

The Pasquill dispersion coefficients are based on the field experimental data, flat terrain, and rural areas. The plots allow for the user to read off dispersion coefficient at specific distance for selected stability class extracted from Table 2. The graphical plots of the dispersion coefficients become useless when solving Gaussian dispersion using a box model on a computer platform. A number of analytical equations have been developed that express dispersion coefficients for rural and urban areas. These algebraic solutions are fitted against the dispersion coefficient plots and provide a few methods to calculate each dispersion factor. One of the methods is the use of power law to describe dispersion coefficients (37] and (40]:

FIGURE 3: Side of image source which allows for the reflection of plume off ground

This equation The result is the Gaussian dispersion equation for a continuous point-source. provides the downwind concentration from an isolated point source located at (O,O,z) to infinity. There are a number of simplified forms of the Gaussian Plume formula for situations such as maximum concentration/first touchdown of the plume and ground level sources (37].
2.1.2. Dispersion Coefficients

cry = ax h (4) crz = cxd + e where x and variables a through e are distance [m] and dimensionless parameters, respectively.
Parameters a through e are functions of the atmospheric stability class and the downwind is a function to obtain dispersion coefficients or a combination of power law and another approach. Another approach, most commonly used in dispersion models is shown as follows (40]:

The dispersion coefficients,

a Y and a z

in Equation (1 ), are used in the dispersion model to

provide the dispersion effect of the plume. These coefficients describe how well the atmosphere is mixed. Ideally, high mixing of air in the atmosphere which surrounds a source is sought. High mixing results in good dispersion of the pollutants and thus, lower ground level concentrations. The state of the atmosphere depends on few variables such as mechanical mixing induced by winds and thermal mixing induced by solar insulation . The most commonly used descriptive of the atmosphere's state is provided by Pasquill Stability classes. There are six classes labeled A to F, ranging from unstable or most turbulent to most stable or least turbulent conditions,

where B = f respectively. McMullen (41] developed the following dispersion coefficients as the most representative of Turner's version of the rural Pasquill dispersion coefficients for rural areas. The advantage of the McMullen's equation is its application to both vertical and horizontal dispersion coefficients .

Constants g through i are dimensionless parameters as provided in Table 3. There also exist dispersion coefficients suitable for urban areas. Experimental data obtained from urban areas result in higher dispersion coefficients [42] and [43]. The plume encounters turbulence due to buildings and relatively warmer temperatures associated with urban areas. These can alter the atmospheric conditions for a small localized area when compared to the prevailing meteorological conditions. A higher dispersion coefficient results in a closer maximum ground-level concentrations as demonstrated in Figure 4.

2.1.3. Characterization of Various Emission Sources in Gaussian Dispersion Model The Gaussian Plume model originally developed for point sources (i.e. tall stacks) can be also applied to other types of emission sources. These emission sources are most commonly described as volume, line, and area sources. The box dispersion models are also capable of handling sources below grade and flares. These sources (e.g. quarries or flares) are not typical of Toronto city and therefore, will not be discussed. Toronto is mainly characterized by sky scrapers and highways, which can translate to volume sources and line (or area) sources.
Volume Source A building structure is characterized in an air dispersion model as a volume source. The solution proposed under the Gaussian Plume model is to model the volume source as a point source at a distance with matching dispersion coefficients to the dimensions of the virtual source [40] , as shown in Figure 5. The initial lateral and vertical dimensions are modified dimensions of source width and height, as shown in Table 5.

The governing equation of a line source oriented at an oblique angle, as shown in Figure 7, to the mean wind vector was developed by Calder [43]. The perpendicular distance, d P , is the distance between the receptor and the line source. Angle 8 is the angle between its normal and the wind vector and applies to angles as large as 75° [46]. This solution is shown in Equation (9) [45]:

In the case of area sources, dispersion coefficients are evaluated using power law as shown in Equation (1 0). The dispersion coefficient in the z-direction is to be evaluated for a distance of x - x ' (concentration at a receptor) and thus , it is expressed in a power law form [45]:

Area Source An alternative method that can be used to model emissions from a road is by describing the road as area source. Open fields from which wind erosion occurs is another example of an area source. In essence, a line source with width x 1 normal to the wind direction can be used to represent an area source as shown in Figure 8. The area source (considered to be long enough to be infinite) is a sum of smaller line sources, each of strength Qadx 1 per unit length , where emission rate is Qa. There are two descriptions of area sources that follow the Gaussian Plume model.

There also exists a dry deposition option available in the box model ISC-PRIME. It is applied to particulate formed by gaseous pollutants. These emissions are characterized by a high fraction of particulate over 2 Jlffi in diameter.

2.1.4. Limitations of Gaussian Plume Dispersion
There are a number of limitations that must be observed before applying the basic Gaussian Plume model to air dispersion problems . Following is a description of each limitation [37]: a) vertical and crosswind diffusion occur according to Gaussian distribution ; b) downwind diffusion is negligible compared to downwind transport; c) the emissions rate, Q, is continuous and constant; d) the horizontal wind velocity and the mean wind direction are constant; e) there is no deposition, washout, chemical conversion or absorption of emissions , and an~ e_missions diffusing to the ground are reflected back into the plume (i.e. all em1ss1ons are totally conserved within the plume); f) there is no upper barrier to vertical diffusion and there is no crosswind diffusion barrier· g) emissions reflected upward from the ground are distributed vertically as if released from an imaginary plume beneath the ground and are additive to the actual plume distribution; and h) the use of a Y and a z as constants at a given downwind distance and the assumption of an expanding conical plume require homogeneous turbulence throughout the x, y and z -directions of the plume. It is important to note that many of these limitations have been resolved by studies conducted in the application of Gaussian Plume dispersion model to urban areas. Additional limitations can ~rise _in following situations, identified by this study, such as decision over election of source type (1.e. line, area or volume) adequate to be assigned to an emission source e.g. road sources. Another limit~tion of the model is its under performance during cooler months of the year. This can be potentially resolved through the modification of dispersion coefficients.

ra, rd , and

V g are deposition velocity [cm/s], aerodynamic resistance [s/cm], deposition

layer resistance [s/cm], and gravitational settling velocity [cm/s], respectively. The distance closer to the ground can be divided into two phases: a) fully turbulent region with vertical fluxes constant; b) a thick quasi-laminar sub-layer. Both regions can be identified using Monin-Obukhov length, L , an implicit function of friction velocity. Iteration is used to evaluate L until the solution converges [51]. The iteration is completed using Equation (16): (16)

2.1.5. Chemistry in Gaussian Plume Dispersion
One of the most commonly used Gaussian Plume model is ISC-PRIME. [49)[31 )[32)[36] This box model handles NOx and SOx in following ways: a) decay term; b) dry deposition; and c) wet deposition. 1 The use of decay term D [s- ] is one way of including the removal of a pollutant in the Gaussian Plume model as follows [40]:

2.1.6. Treatment of Inversion Layers Winter months not only give poor dispersion conditions but inversion layers can also trap pollutants. The Gaussian Plume model can be modified to include inversion layers. The approach is similar to that used in augmenting basic Gaussian Plume to include ground reflection. A more rigorous approach in modeling inversion layers is shown in Equation (25) [53].

This barrier prevents the plume from dispersing in the vertical direction and forces the emissions to the ground as shown in Figure 9. This is an extreme case of poor dispersion and often is a result of off-shore sea breeze. A ground based inversion, fumigation could also be expressed by modifying Gaussian Plume model. Fumigation as it can be handled by Gaussian Plume is shown in Equation (26) [40].

atmosphere due to combustion of fuel are strictly related to sulphur content in the fuel. Regulations are put in place to control the content of sulphur in fuel , result for the annual and diurnal cycles to be significantly reduced in comparison to that of NOx [56] . There are a number of deposition mechanisms that can be identified with NOx and S0 2 such as dry deposition, wet deposition , and cloud water deposition . These mechanisms are discussed in the following with means to further augment existing Gaussian Plume model.

~---------

3.1. Dry Deposition The surface concentration always tends towards the atmospheric concentration. This tendency can be disrupted by three processes which move the gasses down the gradient between the Molecular atmosphere and the surface. Turbulent diffusion moves the gas to the surface. diffusion transfers the gas across the laminar boundary layer next to the surface. Gas molecules dissolve or react with the surface itself. All three must be present for dry deposition to occur. Dry deposition is a function of deposition velocity and the transfer resistance. Formation of sulphuric acid and nitric acid are two dry reactions of importance to emissions from urban areas. Some measurements of dispersing plumes show a 4% per hour, on a sunny day for the conversion of S0 2 to H2 S0 4 [53]. Production of nitric acid occurs at night as the radical is photolytically unstable.
Deposition Velocity Given there is a flux due to a gradient between the atmospheric concentration at 1-2 m above the ground and zero concentration at the surface, the deposition velocity is given as [57]:

Transfer Resistance Transfer resistance is considered as a part of the concept of conductance to describe particulate deposition from atmosphere to surface. Deposition velocity is defined as conductance.

3. ATMOSPERHIC CHEMISTRY OF NOx AND SOx
In an urban area, the main sources of NOx and SOx emissions arise from the road traffic, emissions from fuel fired equ ipment which provides power/electricity, and fuel fired equipment which provides power/electricity, and industries. At the present time , the most complete databases (i.e. National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI)) available in Canada contain the emissions of NOx and SOx from industrial sources only. Most recent publication shows that transportation contributes to 40% of NOx (transportation) and 28% NOx (road vehicles) and 4% SOx (transportation) annually [55]. Emissions of NOx into the atmosphere due to combustion of fuel are driven by the nitrogen in the atmosphere. Approximately 90% of emissions due to combustion of fuel result in NO [53]. NO can potentially convert to N0 2 , therefore, it is often referred to as NOx and N02 when estimating emissions. In addition , for urban areas, diurnal variations in NOx are observed due to morning and afternoon traffics. Emissions of SOx into the

reference height, surface concentration flux to surface [kg/m /s] , aerodynamic resistance [s/m], and surface resistance [m/s] , respectively. The aerodynamic resistance, ra , can be added as two resistors in series: turbulent resistance transfer and by eddies and molecular diffusion of the gas through the laminar boundary layer to the surface itself. For urban area, an area with high surface roughness and strong winds , the aerodynamic resistance becomes low. Table 7 summarizes typical aerodynamic values used for ra . The surface resistance values have been widely studied and are readily available [57].

Dry deposition , Equation (29), was expanded by Wesely [58] for S0 2 . This equation is augmented to include a term which represents bulk surface resistance, rc. The rc includes not only vegetated surfaces but the range of surface conditions. Bulk surface resistance for seasonal categories and land use may be estimated using equation augmented in Equation 29. As the temperature drops (< -2 °C) , the surface resistance increases. Therefore, Wesely [58] briefly discussed surface uptake of HN0 3 , S0 2 , and N0 2 by the following term for each substance.

3.2. Wet Deposition
Sulphur and nitrogen are incorporated into cloud droplets , raindrops and snow flakes , which are deposited on ground. The reactions of sulphur and nitrogen in water form a complex set based on presence of gaseous 0 3 and H20 2 , and catalysts Mn and Fe at surface of aerosol particles. These reactions last for days, thus deposition may occur thousand kilometers from the source [53].

3.3. Cloud Water Deposition
Scavenging below and in-cloud of gases is yet another transport phenomenon which should be accounted for in air dispersion models. The S0 2 gas can dissolve in clouds as it is considered a moderately soluble gas [59]. One approach to estimate below-cloud scavenging is proposed by Asman [59]. The equations are limited to rain and do not include "snow" type of precipitation. Below cloud scavenging coefficient, A h, is a function of rain fall , /, as described in Equation (31 ). Temperature , and relative humidity, rh (0), are measured at ground level. A second approach to calculate below-cloud scavenging was developed by Chang [60]. simpler approach which utilizes one equation and applies to rain and snow fall is as follows: A

4. APPLICATIONS OF GAUSSIAN PLUME MODEL TO URBAN AREAS
The evaluation of emissions for an urban area depends on emission summary, meteorological data, and surroundings. This information can be embedded into a dispersio.n model to esti~ate concentrations of various chemicals across the area of interest. The predicted concentrations can further be compared to the monitored data of the area. There are a number of approaches applied to dispersion of pollutants around a city which include the study of street canyons, forecasting type of modeling, and applications of statistical distribution to describe behaviour of a plume. This section evaluates the applications of Gaussian dispersion to five cities around the world and provides a critique of different applications of Gaussian dispersion for urban areas. Two studies have been completed on predicting ground level concentrations of various pollutants for the City of Toronto, one using land use regression and second a Gaussian dispersion m.odel. The final subsection contains a description of a small scale study conducted for the c1ty of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and emissions due to traffic specifically emissions of N02. The ground level concentrations were predicted using ISC-PRIME model and compared to the monitored data. The dispersion modeling was conducted for the first few days of February 2005, days leading to the earliest smog season recorded in Toronto [12].
4.1. Dispersion Modeling of the City of Kanto, Japan . Kitabayashi et al. [4] studied NOx emissions for a mega city, Kanto, ~a~an. The main sour~es included mobile sources (trucks), an electric power plant, and vent1lat1on towers that serv1ce automotive tunnels. In that study, the Gaussian plume model was augmented with a chemical reaction module and incorporated concentrations for background gases. The integrated model was tested against a typical stack gas (point source). Results were stated as reliabl.e with no analysis provided. This would quantify the relationship of ~ata tha~ led t.o a conclus1on of ~he model's reliability. Proposed investigations for the future 1nclude 1nclus1on of more data (1.e. monitoring stations) for the area of interest and comparison of observed concentrations to the predicted by the integrated Gaussian plume model.

For the predicted occurrences of the highest concentrations, the meteorological data during the winter season was reviewed and reasons for possible under predictions were provided. The under prediction in the cooler season was due to (cold stable conditions) the poor dispersion. In addition, the average daily traffic flow was used while the remaining information was set in the model on an hourly basis. The cold stable conditions may be described by using the approach of Milliez and Carissimo [66] and Owen et al. [5] commented on missed smaller sources (i.e. winter emissions due to combustion related to heating of homes). Perhaps if hourly data of traffic were available, the correlation would have been improved. The study did include review of modeled concentrations for the top percentiles against the observed data. The statistical analysis included the calculation of mean, standard deviation, correlation, and fraction of data within a factor of two. A description of the model setup and grid density, chemistry, building effect and dry and wet deposition was not discussed in the above model. The chemistry may be approached using methods of Asman, Chang, Wesely and Cana-Cascallar [59], [60], [58] and [67]. The building effect on the dispersion and modification to the dispersion code can be set as per any of the proposed solutions by Milliez and Carissimo, Xie et al., Baker et al., Baik et al. [66], [68], [69] and [70]. Treatment of slow winds may be approached by the method used by Goyal et al. [71 ]. All these approaches would have been refined the algorithm and possibly lead to a better correlation. The study did not also comment on the use of various years for input into the model. Obtaining input data and meteorological information for the same year as the observed ambient concentrations would yield refined correlations. Second Model . Seika et al. [6] transformed the German dispersion model IMMAUS designed for the former city of west-Berlin into a computer platform formulated for the city of London, UK. The emission inventory included traffic, non traffic point, and area sources. Concentrations were evaluated on a gird of various densities from 1 to 10 km spatial separation. The model included hourly meteorological data and background concentrations. The Gaussian plume included total reflection. The dispersion model handled dry and wet deposition for area sources only. The modeled concentrations showed a good agreement to the monitored data observed for the year 1993. The study also provided an in depth review of the physics behind the assumed dispersion, meteorology, and emissions inventory. An observed limitation was the need to improve how the Gaussian plume diffusion applied to wind speeds below 1 m/s, varying wind speeds and need a module which calculated mid-day boundary layer depths. The dry deposition for area sources was simulated using Chamberlain's source depletion formulation. The study did not provide statistical analysis of the comparison for the modeled concentrations and observed values.
4.3. Dispersion Modeling of the City of Helsinki, Finland The NOx emissions, dispersion, and chemical transformation for Helsinki metropolitan area was also modeled by Karppinen et al. [7] and [8]. Its objective was to study traffic-originated NOx and to compare the results to four local monitoring stations for the year 1993. The domain of the city of Helsinki is approximately 30 by 30 km. Concentrations were modeled on a receptor grid with a network having dense grid (50 by 50 m) in the vicinity of the major roads and largest grid interval of 500 by 500 m around the perimeter of the city. Results were plotted as iso-concentration curves.

The above model lacks statistical analysis in the form of comparing percentiles of modeled concentrations to monitored data for different time frames. The study overcomes one of the Gaussian dispersion limitations: the equation of continuity assumes dispersion of a chemically stable material that did not deposit to the ground [53]. The model could be augmented by the addition of dry and wet deposition for the NOx and SOx species using methods described in the open literature [61], [62], [63] and [64]; thus, improving the overall mass balance.
4.2. Dispersion Modeling of the City of London, UK Two dispersion models were studied for the city of London, UK.

First Model Owen et al. [5] utilized an existing air dispersion model which incorporated skewed .- Gaus~ian distribution, ADMS-URBAN, along with meteorological data from one meteorological stat1on, background concentrations of pollutants of interest for the 1995, year and emissions inventory from 1997 for the city of London. The model covered a domain of approximately 40 km by 40 k~ in the city of London and estimated ground level concentrations of NOx and N02. The ma1n sources of emissions (75 wt%) were roads characterized as line sources and industrial sources characterized as point sources. The modeled concentrations were compared to the monitored data for the summer and winter of 1995. Concentrations of NOx and N0 2 were predicted utilizing the empirical function derived by Derwent and Middleton [65]. The modeled concentrations showed an under-prediction for winter months with a conclusion that the overall model's performance was reasonable when compared to the monitored data.

The hourly traffic emissions were based on EEME/2 transportation planning system (INRO 1994) and new emission factors that related to Helsinki city traffic. Pollutant concentrations were computed using the road network dispersion model CAR-FMI and urban dispersion modeling system UDM-FMI. Road sources were modeled as line source and remaining sources were

assigned characteristics of point sources. The meteorological data was obtained from two YTV meteorological stations and the mixing height of the atmospheric boundary layer was evaluated from a sounding station 90 km North-West of the city. The 1998 study compared predicted annual average concentration to the observed data, showing a good agreement. There was a good agreement between the modeled data and three of the 4 YTV stations, however, there was a poor agreement with the 4th station. Road emissions contributed less than 50% of total emissions. Their analysis showed traffic sources have greater effect than industrial sources on the ground-level concentrations. In another study [8], the evaluation of seasonal and monthly concentrations was included. The results still contain severe under prediction of the modeled NOx for the same 4th monitoring station as identified in the 1998 study. Furthermore, within the later study, the under prediction has been recognized for the winter months [8]. That study, comments on the variation between the modeled and observed concentrations. The statistical analysis included root mean squared error, index of agreement, correlation coefficient, normalized mean square error, and fractional bias. These parameters were applied to predicted and observed data sets as suggested by Willmott [38]. Both studies did not provide a review of all data provided by external bodies (meteorology, traffic , and ambient concentrations) utilized. The review of meteorology (i.e. wind roses, wind speeds, and stability classes) could provide an insight into variables that drive dispersion. Review of the calms and the treatment of calm conditions were not addressed. The study did not discuss traffic data to asses its limitations in the analysis. The review of ambient concentrations can give an insight of sampling methods and their limitations. Finally, the study did not address review data that did not pass quality control and thus, was not included in the modeling. Furthermore, Karppinen et al. [8] proceeded to compare modeled hourly average concentrations to the observed data. A discussion was not given on the shortcomings of the data. The hourly average concentrations did not have a good agreement with the monitored data. A preferred approach can include a review of more than 1 year of modeled, selecting a year that best represents the meteorological conditions. A further look at the hourly averages on a daily basis along with the review of the meteorological conditions for these hours and traffic data may have provided an insight into why certain hourly averages did not match the modeled values (e.g. reduced traffic due to shutdown of a street would have resulted in lower observed concentrations but was not seen by the model). The monitored data was obtained at 4 m for two stations and 6 m for the fourth station . The study did not specify at what heights the concentrations were predicted and if those heights relate to the monitored data. The study commented on road emissions being below 50% of the total emission and having a great impact on the final concentrations . It did not provide an explanation for this observation and it can be explained by source characteristics. Roads modeled as area sources are ground based and therefore , do not disperse as well as tall sources which have thermal and momentum rise (i.e. industrial sources). Tall sources, even though made more than 50% of the total emissions, dis~~rse better than sources which behave as ground based sources. [40], [53], [37] and [45] In add1t1on, road_ sources could have also been modeled as smaller virtual sources (i.e. width/length) as proposed 1n US EPA [51]. This approach is time consuming but addresses the dispersion associated with the traffic. The lack of agreement between the modeled concentrations and the observed data at the 4th monitoring station may be explained by building downwash effect. The severe under prediction could be explained by a possible plume trap (i.e. busy intersection with tall buildings) around the area thus , resulting in higher observed concentrations. By reviewing the traffic data and locations of the monitoring stations, adjustments could have been made to correct the study to account for a better representation of the dispersion around the 4th monitoring station.

4.4. Dispersion Modeling of the City of Prague, Czech Republic Brechler [9] developed a Gaussian dispersion model for the city of Prague. Sources were characterized as point (stacks of thermal power plants), line (traffic sources) , and area sources Emissions due to (cross roads, petrol stations, parking sites, railway, and bust stations). furnaces which heat homes were included. Brigg's formula was used to define plume rise [72]. A complex network of monitors maintained by Czech Hydrometeorological Institute and hygienic service of the Prague city includes 27 monitors. The model was used to estimate concentrations of various pollutants for years 1994, 1996, and 1998. The study did not explain the selection of non-consecutive years for which concentrations were evaluated. The model did resolve a limitation of a Gaussian dispersion model, inability to resolve flow field due to complex terrain. This was resolved by dividing the domain into smaller segments with individual meteorological conditions computed by a mesoscale model. Gaussian dispersion was selected primarily due to time limitations and simplicity of the model. An alternative approach to describing stability of the atmosphere was done by utilizing Bubnik - Koldovsky classification and not Pasquill [73]. This approach uses a classification based on the value of vertical gradient of temperature and splits all possible conditions of vertical temperature stability into 5 categories for each vertical segment. Pasquiii-Gifford approach utilized solar insulation and wind speed [37]. The study did not discuss statistical analysis of the predicted values and monitored data. 4.5. Historical Work Completed on the Simulation of Pollution Type of Studies Completed for the City of Toronto, Canada Remarkably, little work has been published on simulating ground level concentrations of various pollutants for the City of Toronto [74], [75] and [76] All three studies look at the emissions from the city using various tools and on various domain sizes. First Study The 1996 publication by Lin et al. was a study of a single poor air quality episode observed on April 6, 1992, at some distance away from the City of Toronto. This publication was a result of a program entitled Southern Ontario Oxidants Study (SONTOS 92) . The objective of the SONTOS 92 program was to study the impact of emissions from the City of Toronto on the ozone levels in two areas: the first one located 140 km North-East of the City of Toronto in the city of Hastings and the second one 80 km South-West of Toronto in the city of Binbrook. Lin et al. [74] applied a one dimensional photochemical transport model along with Lagrangian calculations to model the emission of pollutants from the city. The City of Toronto was assumed to be a box of 20 by 30 km. The model predicted concentrations of various contaminants in Hastings and compared them to the observed data on April 6, 1992. The study concludes that the City of Toronto has an impact on the ozone levels downwind and further studies on regional scale were to be completed. No results were published for the city of Binbrook. It is important to note that no other results or analysis of data collected under SONTOS 92 have been published. Second Study Yang et al. [75] conducted a smaller in domain exercise by looking at pollution around a specific intersection located in the core of the City of Toronto at Bay Street and King Street. The study concentrated on the street canyon effect, similar to CFD type of exercises. This study was designed with a dense grid and included an area with very tall buildings (i.e. 330m above grade). A non-steady state dispersion model (CALPUFF) was used to predict concentrations at the ground level and at various heights above grade. The meteorological data was predicted using This publication did not study any particular air quality event that MM5-a prognostic model. occurred in the city and did not compare results to measured data. The study concluded that CALPUFF is a potentially adequate tool which can simulate flow fields.

Third Study Unlike the two previous mentioned studies by which dispersion models were utilized , the study conducted by Jerrett et al. considered traffic pollution in the City of Toronto and utilized a land use regression (LUR) approach to predict ground level concentrations of N0 2 · The study was conducted in 2002 for a period of 2 weeks with numerous air samplers deployed across the City of Toronto. A regression of 0.69 was determined with the intention to include other sources and meteorological data to improve the results. In addition , the authors propose to generate more data to encompass a full year.
4.6. Preliminary Dispersion Modeling of the City of Toronto, Canada

Ambient Air Monitoring Station , MOE station I.D. 43020

In our own study, the Gaussian dispersion model along with local meteorological data was applied to road network with the objective to predict 1-h ground level concentrations of N02. Furthermore, the objective of this study was to compare the predicted concentrations to those recorded by a local monitoring station. Description of the Event and Modeling Domain The timing of study was selected to be the first few days of February 2005, coinciding with the beginning of the earliest episode of smog recorded in Toronto. The area of study was selected to be two blocks of major streets surrounding a monitoring station located at Finch Avenue and 2 Yonge Street, station I.D. 34020 [77] , an approximate area of 36 km . The monitoring station did not capture full data for the entire smog episode. The 1-h concentrations of S0 2 , N0 2 , NOx, PM 2 .5 and 0 3 observed at the monitoring station could be obtained from the historical depository [77]. The hourly meteorological data were obtained from a meteorological station at Toronto's Lester B. Pearson International Airport [78], approximately 30 km away from the selected area of study shown in Figure 10. The meteorological data was collected 10 m above the ground . For the time under consideration , there were two predominant wind directions , with the winds occurring at 2 m/s from south-south-east and at 5. 7 m/s from north-north-west, shown in Figure 11. Morning and afternoon peak-traffic times were modeled to occur from 7 am to 9 am and from 4 pm to 6 pm, respectively. Traffic data from 2001 [79] and the Environment Canada's emission factors [80] for various vehicles were used to estimate emission rates of N02 .

Dispersion Model Setup The study area, shown in Figure 12, was set in ISC-PRIME dispersion model (version 04269) to evaluate 1-h ground level concentrations of NOx in urban area. Selection of urban option allowed for the model to utilize urban dispersion factors.

road becomes the basis for the initial lateral dimension. Inclusion of the plume spread factors allows to account for the mixing due to the elevated temperature of the exhaust gas [82]. In addition, each virtual source is separated by the width of the road (25 m) resulting in a series of volume sources. The height of the mobile equipment present on the road (3 m) was used to define the initial vertical dimension. The use of a volume source with embedded dispersion factors (a Y , a z) allows the code to account for vehicle induced turbulence. Results and Discussion The modeled and monitored concentrations for the peak traffic times between 7 am and 9 am are provided in Table 10. Preliminary statistical analysis summarized in Table 11 shows a good agreement between predicted and measured data. Plot of monitored data versus observed data yields a regression of 0.5. It was observed that both the morning and afternoon of day 1 had the least correlation. Note , the sample size is relatively small and further work is required to increase it.

The characterization of road within the dispersion model was based on three options: as line been studied as potential methods to characterize road emissions within the Gaussian dispersion model. The limitation of a line source as mentioned earlier arises when winds approach at angles greater then 75°. The area source has a limit on the length to width ratio 10:1. Furthermore, the use of line or area sources yields an over prediction of the ground level concentrations [81] therefore, it was not evaluated in this study. A third option of setting up a road in a Gaussian dispersion model is to use numerous volume sources along the stretch of the path that follows road [51]. Sometimes this method is referred to as "equivalent line" source where the width of the

Two additional observations with regards to the relationships between the modeled concentrations and road traffic emissions could be made from the results . For the morning traffic, This can be explained by the the model under-predicted the ground level concentrations . presence of calm meteorological conditions that have limited mixing [5]. The afternoon traffic model over-predicted the ground level concentrations. This over-prediction could be a result of the presence of fog/clouds in the afternoon hours however, further study is necessary. To further refine calculations , one can add emissions from local industrial sources as well as the nearby 400 series highways in addition to updating the traffic information with a 2005 traffic count. The meteorological conditions, specifically the presence of fog and clouds , could be accounted via the inclusion of the wet deposition. The analysis of hourly and 24 hour averages would be of interest and allow one to further refine the results. As indicated in the previous sections, the Gaussian dispersion model did not perform accurately when simulating during the winter period.

5. CONCLUSIONS
The air quality in Ontario is on a decline and causes the province additional cost in health care as well as limits enjoyment of the outdoors. The provincial governing bodies introduced regulations to reduce air emissions ; and communication tools in the form of AQI however, this communication tool has its own limitations. One major limitation of the AQI is that for many cities , the local air quality, often over 50 km in radius , is evaluated by a single monitoring station. This lack of resolution results in large areas being declared with "poor" air quality when in fact the situation may be highly localized. Another limitation is that the air quality is based on unprocessed data from the monitoring stations. Without some appreciation of the quality of the data, and an understanding of the data in context with the region , it is difficult to fully trust that predictions of air quality are accurate. Finally, the program is costly in maintenance. With governments at all levels experiencing budgetary limits, a costly environmental system is much more difficult to run and manage when the return is rarely visible. An improved set of methods to determine the AQI should include canyon effects, land regression modeling , and dispersion modeling . Canyon effects and land regression modeling have their own limitations since they only cover a small geographical area of study and require extensive preprocessing and manipulation of large data sets. Dispersion modeling is not a new approach and has been carried out in major cities across the world and showed a good agreement with monitored data for the area of interest. In the preliminary study shown in this paper, a small scale dispersion model for the city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, was carried out. The results showed a reasonable agreement with the monitoring data with respect to predicting localized contaminant concentrations. Furthermore, by super-imposing the hourly concentrations over the modeled area, the results showed locations of localized hot spots (i.e. poor air quality). The readily available tools and data combined with a dispersion model provide a more accurate representation of the air quality at a lower cost than the existing systems in place. A dispersion model applied to the city of Toronto removes the assumption of uniform air quality within the vicinity of a monitoring station. This clearly addresses one of the key limitations of the AQI. The preliminary results are encouraging to apply existing air dispersion model , available emissions data for assessing air quality in the city of Toronto.

CHAPTER 2 DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARSUS MODEL
2.1 The ARSUS Computer Model
An Air dispersion model for the Road Sources in Urban areaS (ARSUS) based on the Gaussian

air dispersion principles was developed and written in MATLAB (version 7.0.0.19920 (R14)). The ARSUS model was developed to simulate dispersion of tailpipe emissions in an urban area such as the City of Toronto. The modelling runs were executed on a standard PC platform equipped with Pentium(R) M processor 1.4 GHz and 586 MHz of RAM and Windows XP based environment. MATLAB was selected for the following reasons:

a) the ability to handle data in a matrix and array structures (i.e. input and output data); b) the majority of the code was written in function format, therefore, reducing the redundancy of the code (i.e. "IF-ELSE" and "FOR-END" loops), and allowing for "one point" of correcting or updating the code; c) the ability to run batch files without the user watching over the ARSUS model; d) the ability to plot the results (isopleths) which normally would have to be completed using a secondary software and required processing of data (i.e. geographical interface software such as SURFER); e) the possibility to edit equations and approaches to solving plume dispersion equations (i.e. change of plume dispersion parameters and or plume rise solutions); f) a new code allows the user to expand beyond current limitations of existing US EPA dispersion models (i.e. ISC3) where it is able to use: and i.) capable to include more than 300 sources; and ii.) capable of handling more than 3,000 receptors. g) it is readily available.
39

The ARSUS model is based on selected equations, Equations (3) and (7), which estimate ground level concentrations based on meteorological data and emissions data following the standard Gaussian air dispersion solutions.

START: Concentration.m

2.2 Limitations of the ARSUS Model
Following are some of the identified limitations of the ARSUS model:

Define static source variables: Hs, D, Us, Ts

Input File: Emissions.xls UTM coordinates a) The ARSUS model currently mimics the US EPA' s ISC3 air dispersion model 1· The original purpose for this initial setup was to validate the ARSUS model against ISC3. b) The executing time is a function of both the number of emission sources and grid density. c) As with any modelling exercises, there exists an important aspect of quality of data fed into the ARSUS model. At the present time, the meteorological data can be Add a buffer zone of 100 m around the modelling domain. Find: North East corner and South West comer of the modelling domain.

easily obtained but the traffic data required a number of assumptions to be made and can be further refined.

2.3 Pseudo-Code for the ARSUS Model
The pseudo-code of the ARSUS model is provided in Figures 2-1 a to 2-1 d. The main code is written in a MATLAB m-file entitled Concentration.m (Figure 2-1a). The file reads two EXCEL input data files: a) Source data file - containing the source details; and b) Meteorological data file - containing the hourly meteorological details.

Define a grid within the modelling domain.

Input File: Meteorology.xls For each hour: U, SC, Ta, U dir
(a)

The domain is sub-divided into a grid of points. The program evaluates concentration from each source to each grid point and sums the calculated concentrations for every hour. The final matrix of concentrations is written to an EXCEL file. The program evaluates the hourly concentrations and can be set to run for a continuous series of meteorological hours.

Note that the US EPA 's ISC3 model is limited in the number of sources and receptors; the ARSUS code does not suffer the same limitation.

Since the program can handle significantly more emission sources and grid receptors than a standard US EPA dispersion model, the time it takes to evaluate 1 hour of meteorological data increases as the density of the grid increases and/or the number of emission sources increases. Note, there is a fine balance one must choose when deciding on the grid spacing in order to minimize run time. Note 1

The input data (i.e. emission rates from various sources and meteorological data) utilized with the Gaussian dispersion equations embedded in the ARSUS model yield 1 h ground level concentrations for a contaminant of interest. This information is useful for: a) simulation of various tailpipe emissions (i.e. CO, SOx, NOx, PM, etc) and impact of the emissions on the local area; b) replacement of ambient air monitoring stations which adds costs of on-gmng maintenance; c) simulation of daily traffic patterns; d) comparison of the resulting ground level concentrations to the Ambient Air Quality standards set by the MOE or Canada Wide Standards set by the Environment Canada; and e) prediction of air quality, similar to the AQI network based on the ambient mr monitoring stations, to communicate the findings to the public.

CHAPTER 3 COMPILATION OF THE INPUT DATA REQUIRED FOR THE ARSUS MODEL
3. 1 Meteorological Data
The hourly meteorological data (i.e. ambient temperature, wind velocity and direction) were obtained from a meteorological station located at Toronto's Lester B. Pearson International Airport (Environment Canada Weather Network, 2008). The station's details are provided in Table 3-1. The meteorological station is located North of Highway 401 and west of Highway 427. The meteorological data were obtained from the station located at Lester B. Pearson

International Airport as the station is located in the heart of the modeling domain and because it captures the entire range of meteorological conditions required for the modeling purposes as well as for the full 24 h time period and full year. Table 3-1. Toronto Lester B. Pearson International Airport location in City of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The 1 h surface meteorological data was obtained from this station for the 2007 year, Figure 3-1. Station's Parameter: Latitude Longitude Elevation Climate ID.

3.2 Traffic Data
For most urban areas, the major sources of emissions ofNOx and S0 2 are roads (traffic) (Fenger, 1999; 2009; Mage et al., 1996; Yang et al., 2007) and such applies to the City of Toronto as well (Siemiatycki, 2007; Toronto Public Health, 2007; Jerrett et al., 2007). The City of Toronto's unique structure contains few small scale businesses, a network of roads and highways but no major non-industries, unlike the city of Sault St. Marie located in Ontario. The Sault St. Marie city is well known for its local pulp and paper and steel industries and their impact on local Figure 3-2.

For the purpose of estimating emissions from the road sources, the traffic data were obtained for the major highways that run across the City of Toronto. Table 3-3 lists roads and highways included in two modelling exercises; a) a smaller scale exercise in the vicinity of the Toronto West monitoring station, and b) all highways crossing the city of Toronto. In order to estimate emissions, appropriate traffic counts had to be obtained for the major roadways.

The traffic data for the 400 highway series is maintained by the province, specifically Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO), Highway Standards Branch Traffic Office. The most recent data available are for the year 2005 and are presented in the form of an annual average daily traffic count (AADT).

The UTM coordinates of the start and end point of each road link were extracted from the general map of the City of The traffic data for municipal roads are maintained by the City of Toronto, Transportation Services, Traffic Safety Unit. The city publishes the traffic data for various time frames. For Toronto. Figures 3-5 and 3-6 show all links of various road and highway segments included in the two modelling exercises.

the purpose of this study, the average weekday, 24 h traffic volumes were used for the highway sources (only available data) and morning peak hour traffic volumes were used to estimate emissions for the road (City of Toronto, 2008). The traffic data are provided for each section of the road listing both bounds (i.e. South and North). The most recent data available are based on the data collected for various streets between the years 2002 and 2006. The 1 h average traffic data for links of highways sections and length of the section are provided in Tables 1 and 2 in Appendix 2.

3.3 Emissions Estimates
Two exercises were completed simulating tailpipe emissions from vehicles travelling on roads

It is important to note that neither the City of Toronto nor the MTO provide the composition of

and highways. The first exercise, as shown in Figure 3-5, considered tailpipe emissions for a smaller area and surrounding traffic in the vicinity of the Toronto West monitoring station. The modelling domain was set to be 8.2 km by 5.9 km, with 723 volume sources representing the roads and highways. The width of a highway was assumed to be 27m (6 lanes at 4.5 m each) and 18 m (4 lanes at 4.5 m each).

The second exercise, Figure 3-6, considered tailpipe emissions from highways for a larger modelling domain with over 1,800 volume sources. The modelling domain was set to be 34.6 km by 23 .2 km, with 1819 emission sources representing all highways. The width of a highway was assumed to be 27m.

CHAPTER4 VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION OF ARSUS MODEL
The validation exercise was carried out in two parts: a) performance of the ARSUS model in comparison to the ISC3 dispersion model; and b) verification of the ARSUS model to make sure it is capable of appropriately estimating plume dispersion as the wind direction changes.

The tailpipe emissions were based on the most recent data published by the Transport Canada for the year 2006 (Transport Canada, 2008). and fuels. The data are available for various types of vehicles

For the purpose of two studies, it was assumed that the following vehicles were

traveling on the highways and roads: a) light-duty passenger automobiles (LDPV -A), b) light-duty passenger trucks (minivans, SUV's and light trucks) (LDPV-T), and c) light-duty commercial vehicles (LDCV) and heavy-duty commercial trucks (HDCV). A summary of traffic composition for the aforementioned vehicular types is provided in Table 3-4.

4.1 Setup of the Validation Exercise: /SC3 versus ARSUS Model
The validation of the model was conducted in a series of 3 modelling cases, each repeated for a point source and volume source, in both the US EPA, ISC3 air dispersion model and the ARSUS model. Meteorological parameters used in all validation cases were set to be the same as

Furthermore, LDPV-A and LDPV-T were assumed to be fuelled with gasoline and LDCV and HDCV fuelled by diesel. The emission factors for gasoline and diesel given in grams of

In each case, all the emission sources were modelled as point sources with identical parameters to reduce potential errors, as summarized in Table 4-2. Both dispersion models were used to estimate concentrations from the source(s) at a series of receptors. The receptors were set to be a series of points separated approximately 10m apart and set to the North of the source(s).

4.3 Results of the Validation Exercise
The modelled concentrations from the test cases, both the validation of point and volume source algorithms, Cases 1-3, were plotted against each other. The plots of predicted concentrations by the ARSUS model versus ISC3 were generated. Two statistics were derived from each plot: a) Regression (r2) value: how well the ARSUS model results compare to ISC3 model results; and b) Slope of line (m): is an indicator whether the ARSUS model over predicts or underpredicts.

Results of the Verification of the ARSUS Model's Response to Wind Change

As shown in Figures 4-7 and 4-14, the ARSUS model does slightly under-predict the concentrations but also evaluates concentrations along the correct pathways as the wind direction changes. The ARSUS model is capable of responding correctly to changes in wind direction.

Furthermore, the station is located in

Comparison of Modelled Concentrations: ARSUS Model versus Ambient Air Quality Data from Toronto West Station

The objectives were to model emissions from the roads and highways using the ARSUS model and compare the results to the data from the Toronto West station. This was carried out in two parts: a) a small scale study of traffic in the vicinity of the Toronto West monitoring station; and b) a large scale study of highway emissions in the City of Toronto. The contaminant of choice was CO and 1 h average concentrations were modelled.

5.2.1 Small Scale Study of Tailpipe Emissions in the Vicinity of the Toronto West Monitoring Station
For the small scale study, all the roads and highways situated in the vicinity of the Toronto West monitoring station were used to estimate emissions. The modelling domain was set to be 8.2 km by 5.9 km, with 723 volume sources representing the roads and highways. The width of a highway was assumed to be 27 m (6 lanes at 4.5 m each) and 18 m (4 lanes at 4.5 m each). While this study was conducted on a smaller domain, it included all the road and highway

87

networks within the domain. The modelling was completed for the months of April and May, 2007. Only weekdays between the hours of 6 am and 11 am were modelled to capture morning rush hour traffic emissions. The monitoring station has many blank periods lasting up to days when no data are available. April and May represented the most complete data for the station.

For the month of April and May, 2007, the Toronto West monitoring station data are presented in Table 1 in Appendix 7.

As the recorded concentrations measured by the monitoring station increase (400 to 600 !lglm 3), the accuracy of the ARSUS model decreases, under-predicting to a larger magnitude. However, when looking at the modelled emissions as a percentage of the observed concentrations in Figure 5-4, the results are consistent between 10% and 80%, regardless of the magnitude of the observed concentrations.

The concentrations predicted by the ARSUS model in this large scale study are lower in magnitude than the small scale study, as expected since local roads around the monitoring station were removed, however it should be noted that the removal of the local roads only reduced the predicted concentrations marginally, showing that the majority of the impact on concentrations are due to the local highways.

CHAPTER 6 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6. 1 Conclusions
Air quality in Ontario is declining and causes the province additional cost in health care as well as limits enjoyment of the outdoors. The provincial governing bodies introduced regulations to reduce air emissions and communication tools in the form of an AQI · however this ' ' communication tool has its limitations. One major limitation of the AQI is that for many cities, the local air quality, often over 50 km in radius, is evaluated by a single monitoring station. This lack of resolution results in large areas being declared "poor" in air quality when in fact the situation may be highly localized. Another limitation is that the air quality is based on

The two modelling exercises completed in ARSUS continue to show under-prediction of CO concentrations to those observed at the Toronto West monitoring station. This under-prediction is a sign that not all emission sources have been included in the modelling. A number of aspects account for this observation: a) the exercise did not include other potential sources of emissions of CO or background concentrations e.g. the emissions of CO from airplanes from Pearson International airport; b) the hourly traffic data were not used to simulate exact tailpipe emissions; and c) the emission factors used to estimate tailpipe emissions of CO assumed only one composition of traffic and fuel type.

While the model does under-predict the observed concentrations from the monitoring station, the data show that the model consistently under-predicts by the same percentage. The primary reason for this under-prediction is the use of input data limited to tailpipe emissions only (i.e. no background concentrations, other sources etc).

data and an understanding of the data in a regional context, it is difficult to fully trust that predictions of air quality are accurate. Finally, the program is costly in maintenance. With governments at all levels experiencing budgetary limits, a costly environmental system is much more difficult to run and manage when the return is rarely visible.

predict results from the US EPA ISC3 model. This under-prediction was small in magnitude and independent of any of the input data i.e. stability class, wind direction etc. As such, this is a systematic error in the code and one would expect the same error to occur in the model regardless of the varying input data.

An improved set of methods to determine the AQI should include canyon effects, land regression modeling, and dispersion modelling. Canyon effects and land regression modeling have their own limitations since they only cover a small geographical area of study and require extensive pre-processing and manipulation of large data sets. Dispersion modeling is not a new approach and has been carried out in major cities across the world and has showed a good agreement with monitored data for the area of interest.

The readily available tools and data combined with a dispersion model provide a more detailed representation of the air quality at a lower cost than the existing systems in place. A dispersion model applied to the City of Toronto removes the assumption of uniform air quality within the · vicinity of a monitoring station. This clearly addresses one of the key limitations of the AQI.

a)

the residuals plot of the results of a comparison between the ARSUS model-predicted concentrations and those observed at the Toronto West monitoring station show constant under-prediction of the ARSUS model. This under-prediction is mainly

due to the fact that only tailpipe emissions were considered; b) the emissions of CO from the morning rush hour have the highest impact closest to the road I highway source and drop off significantly away from the source. This reinforces understood dispersion knowledge of low sources such as tailpipe

Results of the Validation Exercises

The ARSUS model underwent a number of validation exercises which resulted in following conclusions: a) it is possible to successfully develop an air dispersion model in MATLAB; b) the ARSUS model consistently but slightly under-predicts modelled concentrations for both point and volume type of emission sources when compared to US EPA ISC3 dispersion model; c) the under-prediction is consistent and does not amplify as the distance from the emission source(s) increases or number of emission sources increases; c) the ARSUS model has the ability to respond to wind direction changes and changes in stability classes; and d) the ARSUS model is capable of handling over 300 volume sources and 3,000 receptors which are current limitations of US EPA air dispersion models. c)

emissions which lack momentum or thermal rise; and the impact of tailpipe emissions on areas immediately adjacent to the sources (i.e. roads and highways) is high.

Finally, the ARSUS model was used to simulate tailpipe emissions of CO for a larger modelling domain for only highway sources that cross the City of Toronto. model continued to under-predict concentrations of CO. The results from the ARSUS

The ARSUS model demonstrated that

emissions from the highways rather than roads have a greater impact on the local concentration of CO.

6.2 Recommendations
It has been shown that a computerized air dispersion model can be used to generate data used in

the AQI predictions. The ARSUS model could be modified to account for the following factors: Therefore, the ARSUS model in its current state can successfully simulate emissions from both point and volume type sources using Gaussian dispersion to calculate ground level concentrations of a non-reactive contaminant of interest. a) additional algorithms to calculate plume spread; b) additional sources other than roads i.e. industrial emissions, airport; c) cumulative 24 h or annual average concentrations; d) wet and dry deposition including in-cloud, below cloud deposition; and

b) Account for additional sources other than roads
The City of Toronto's structure is mainly dominated by a network of roads and highways. The model can be used to study emissions of substances other than those that contribute to smog i.e. mercury. Other sources of emissions can include: i) commercial industries/office buildings; ii) small size non-commercial industries such as ready-mix concrete plants and hot mix asphalt plants; iii) one international airport and one smaller airport (i.e. Toronto Island airport); iv) ship yard/marina at the South edge of the city; and v) on-going construction activities that occur through out the city.

the importance of input data specifically the emission rates from the traffic. A further expansion of the existing ARSUS model would be to develop an input file containing emissions from the traffic on an hourly basis.

The ARSUS model can further be used to study emissions from the city of Toronto to assist the city with the development of environmental policies and environmental management systems. Some may include: a) a study of various fuel compositions and their impact on the air quality; b) the impact of the proposed feet change by the City of Toronto on air quality;

c) analyzing hourly concentrations to determine road closure or restrictions on transportation;

Inclusion of these sources would allow the study of contribution of emissions from each source which subsequently can impact city's environmental policy and environmental management development.

d) analyzing traffic around most impacted areas (hot spots of high concentration with poor dispersion) to provide solutions to poor air quality; e) developing a forecasting tool;
f) a study of source contributions of pollution from future expansions of industry,

c) Cumulative 24 h or annual average concentrations
The ambient air quality standards for the smog-causing air pollutants are normally based on 1 h and 24 h average. The ARSUS model does estimate the 1 h average concentrations of a pollutant and can be converted to estimate the 24 h averages, well within the constraints of a steady state Gaussian air dispersion assumptions.

development, construction, and highways in order to evaluate impacts on air quality.

d) Wet and dry deposition
The geographical location of the city of Toronto means changes in season as well as precipitation (i.e. snow and rain). The effect of precipitation can be studied in the form of expanding the ARSUS model to allow for wet deposition and its variations (i.e. in-cloud, below cloud, snow, rain) (Asman, 1995; Chang 1984).

APPENDIX 2:

TRAFFIC AND EMISSIONS DATA

Tables 1 and 2 contain a summary of road source information as well as tailpipe emission factors used to estimate emissions of CO. Table 1 is the summary of the tailpipe emissions broken by

type of mobile equipment used for the small scale modelling exercise. Table 2 is a summary of the tailpipe emissions broken by the type of mobile equipment used for the large scale modelling exercise. Sample calculations and assumptions presented below are for: a) one section of Highway 400 using average daily traffic count; and b) for a section of Dixon Road using morning peak hour traffic count.

The traffic count for the highway sources is given as 24 h traffic count where the traffic for municipal roads is available in peak hour counts.

Sample Calculations:

APPENDIX 2:

TRAFFIC AND EMISSIONS DATA

a) Following sample calculation is for the emissions associated with traffic from the road link modelling I.D. 4001 using average 24 h traffic count. Given: Length of the road = l.2km . passes Dmly average traffic count = 91,900--day
. . f fr g(CO) Em1ss10n rate o CO, om LDPV-A =10.9 - - km Assumed: 64.4% of traffic is composed ofLDPV-A

Emissions of CO from the 4001 segment =

=l.2km*9l,900passes*l0.9g(CO)* day* hr *64.4%=8.96g day km 24hr 3,600s s
b) Following sample calculation is for the emissions associated with traffic from the road link modelling I.D. DXRDI using morning peak hour traffic count. Given: Length of the road= 1.0 lkm

APPENDIX 5: SAMPLE OF THE ISC3 INPUT FILE FOR VALIDATION OF VOLUME SOURCE ALGORITHEM EXERCISE
Following are copies of the US EPA, ISC3 input files used to validate volume sources.
An exercise completed for 3 cases.

A) Case 1: US EPA, ISC3 input file for validation of 1 volume source; B) Case 2: US EPA, ISC3 input file for validation of more than 10 identical, volume sources; and C) Case 3: US EPA, ISC3 input file for validation of more than 50 identical, volume sources. The entire summary of the input/compilation/output file for Case 1 only has been

APPENDIX 5: SAMPLE OF THE ISC3 INPUT FILE FOR VALIDATION OF VOLUME SOURCE ALGORITHEM EXERCISE

included.

This format is automatically generated by ISC3 summarizing compilation of

the input file, analysis, modelling results as well as errors/warning messages.

The input files were setup using a modelling interface and version 02035 of ISC3. The meteorological data was set for wind blowing towards North (0°), at 3 m/s, stability class C and ambient temperature of 294 K. The model was set to calculate 1 h maximum ground level concentrations at specified receptors.

Since, validation of the ARSUS model's performance of point source algorithm showed response of the model to wind direction changes; this exercise was not repeated again.
