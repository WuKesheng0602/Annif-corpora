ABSTRACT
A COMPUTATIONAL STUDY OF THE LUDWIG-SORET EFFECT ON THE THERMAl-INDUCED PHASE SEPARATION PROCESS IN POLYMER SOLUTIONS

Sureshkumar B. Kukadiya., :NIASc, 2008. Departrnent of Chemical Engineering, Ryerson University. 350 Victoria Street , Toronto , Ontario l\!I5B 2K3 Canada. Thermal-induced phase separation (TIPS) is one of the nwthods used to fabricate functional polyn1eric materials, i.e. PDLC filn1s for electro-optical devices such flat-panel
displays~

switchable windows etc., and rnicroporous synthetic membranes frorn polymer

solutions. Since the characteristic thermal, rnechanical, and optical properties of these materials are controlled by the rnorphological features, it is important to understand the phase separation n1echanis1n that forrns these rnaterials. In this work, the effect of thermal diffusion, also known as the Ludwig-Soret effect, on the TIPS method of phase separation via the SD mechanism in polymer solutions under non-uniform temperature field has been investigated using the cornputa.tional technique. The Ludwig-Soret effect occurs -vvhen a ternperature gradient applied to a fluid mixture induces a net n1ass flow, which leads to the forn1a.tion of a concentration gradient. A rigorous mathematical rnodel for TIPS via the spinodal decon1position mechanisn1 based on the nonlinear Cahn-Hilliard and FloryHuggins theories cmnbined with thern1al diffusion phenomenon has been formulated for binary polymer solutions under non-unifonn ternperature field and solved nurnerically. Nunwrical sirnula.tion results revealed that the therrnal diffusion phenon1enon had very little or negligible effect on the phase separation mechanism under a non-uniform temperature
field~

which was reflected from the studies of the tirne evolution of structure factor

and transition time frmn the early to the intern1ediate stages of SD.

CHAPTER 1 GENERALINT DUCTION

Phase separation in polymer solutions or polymer blends has attracted a great arr1ount of interest arr1ong scientists in recent years. Phase separation in polyrr1er solution is one of the rnost ilnportant and very well known phenomena used for manufacturing functional polymeric rnaterials, ·which are extensively used in engineering applications. Son1e of the typical exa.Inples include micro-porous synthetic (polyrneric) rnembranes and polyrner dispersed liquid crystals (PDLC) filrns for electro-optical devices, such as flat-panel displays for conlputer rnonitors, televisions: svvitchable or privacy windows etc. Due to the widespread den1a.nd and scope of the unique therrnal } rnechanical and optical properties of these materials , there has been continuous research and development for the modification of these rnaterials for better properties and functionalities for the last two decades. Therefore, it is very in1portant to understand the nonlinear phenornena that fonn these special materials. This chapter describes the rnethods used to fabricate these n1aterials. It also describes the phenomenon of the 'Lu.dwig-Soret effect' or 'Therrnal Diffu,sion' as it contributes to the process of phase sepaTation along with the ncm-Fickian diffusion (uphill diffusion), under the influence of an externally irnposed spatial linear ternperature gradient.

Phase Sepa_ration in Polymer Solutio11s

Phase separation processes in polymer solutions or polyrner blends are an i1nportant and well-studied problems in rnany areas of n1aterials science. Phase separation in polymer

1

solutions, often called as a process of' de-rn'i xing', involves the transforrnation of the homogeneous polyrner solution in its single-phase state to the inhornogeneous two-phase state, i.e. two-phase separated regions. Such a kind of phase separation can be achieved either by the Nucleation and Growth (NG) nrechanisnr or by the Spinodal Decomposition (SD) rnechanism [1, 8], which will be discussed in detail in the next section of this chapter. Specifically, for binary polymer solutions, two-phase separated regions consist of the polymer-rich and solvent-rich regions . It is very inrportant to stabilize the phase separated structure of a polyrner solution after the process of phase separation in order to utilize its morphological properties to the greatest effect. This is carried out by the process of crystallization, vitrification or gelation of the pol:yn1er-rich phase depending on the
~nd

application of the polymer solution. After the structural stabilization: material transfonns into a porous membrane if the solvent is ren1oved frorn the rnateria1 either by solvent evaporation, extraction, or freeze drying. It can also be transfonned into a PDLC filrn if a low rnolecular weight liquid crystal (LC) is used as a solvent. There are t\vo very popular methods used for the initiation of the phase separation process for the fonnation of anisotropic polymeric rnaterials, na1nely the Thermal Induced Phas e Separation (TIPS) rnethod and the Polyrnerization Ind,uced Phase Separation (PIPS) method [9 , 10, 11].

The structural anisotropy can be introduced by irnposing an external fluctuation, such as an electric field [12, 13], a shear flow [14, 15], a concentration gradient [16, 17, 18, 19], a ternperature gradient [20 , 21, 22], or a controlled chernical reaction [23, 24, 25, 26]. In the TIPS n1ethod, the phase separation process is initiated or induced by rapidly changing the ternperature of the solution, or by introducing the temperature gradient across a polyrner solution and in the PIPS method, as the narne suggests, the phase separation is induced by converting the reactive nronomer molecules into polyrner through the polymerization process.

Phase Separation Mechanisms

Phase separation mechanisrn is usually driven by the therrnodynamics of the poly1ner solution, but kinetic processes like nucleation and rnolecular diffusion often detern1ine the nature of the process. As rnentioned in the previous section, two distinct mechanisms are recognized in the phase separation process, the 1\lucleation and Growth (NG) mechanisrn and the Spinodal Deco,mposition (SD) n1echanis1n [5]. Figure L 1 shows a schematic of a typical phase diagrarn of a binary polyrner solution, which is a plot of te1nperature, T versus solvent concentration, c. The solid curve represents the binodal curve, often called

as an equilibriurn curve and the dash-dot curve represents the spinodal curve. The phase diagrarn is asyrnrnetrical and it shows the upper critical solution temperature (UCST) behavior of a polyrner solution, which is typical of a binary polyrner solution. The area under the spinodal curve (shaded area in gray as shown in Figure 1.1) is called the spinodal or unstable region and the area under the binodal curve and outside the spinodal curve is called the rnetastable region (shaded area with fine dots as shown in Figure 1.1). The point, where the binodal and spinodal curves rneet each other, is called the critical point (a dark filled dot as shown in Figure 1.1) and the corresponding concentration and temperature at the point are called the critical concentration,
Cc,

and the critical ten1perature, Tc,

respectively. The area, outside the binodal curve, represents the region of hmnogeneous single phase.

If the systen1 requires an activation energy for the initiation of the ne\v phase, then the phase separation proceeds by the N'Ucleation and Growth (NG) n1echanisn1 [27]. This

process usually occurs beneath the binodal curve in the metastable region of the phase diagram as shown in Figure 1.1. Alternatively, under the spinodal curve, the phase separation occurs without an activation barrier. This lack of activation barrier changes the nature of the process significantly, leading to the Spinodal Decornposihon (SD) nwchanisrn (27]. vVhich phase separation route the systen1 chooses depends on the size of the gap separating the binodal curve and the spinodal curve, the size of the activation barrier within the metastable region, whether nucleation sites are available, and the rapidity with which the systern crosses the phase boundary line. Such fa.ctors are often critical in PDLC systems or n1icroporous synthetic polymeric rnernbranes, as the nucleation and growth (NG) and the spinodal decon1position (SD) mechanisrns can lead to different types of poly1ner morphologies in the final film as shown in Figure 1. 2.

a binary polymer solution showing different rnorphologies that can be obtained depending on the location of the quench point (c, T) on the phase diagram. If the quench point ( c, T) of the polyn1er solution lies in the rnetastable region of the phase diagran1 , the phase sepa.ra.t ion occurs by the nucleation and growth (NG) rnechanisrn , which produces randmnly distributed droplet-type 1norphology that grows over tirne due to the increase in free energy of the solution. If the quench point (cl T) of the polyrner solution lies in the spinodal region or unstable region of the phase diagrarn , the phase separation occurs by the SD mechanisrn due to existing infinitesirnal concentration fluctuations that drive or initiate the phase separation in the SD region and two kinds of Inorphologies are formed : the

.5

droplet-type (off critical quench) and the interconnected-type (critical quench) as shown in Figure 1.2. Depending on the location of the quench point ( c, T), the droplet type structure has a continuous phase and dispersed phase as indicated by the reversal of black and whiteregions as shown in the SD structures in Figure 1.2.

Figures 1.3 and 1.4 show the one-dirnensional spatial concentration profile of phase separation by NG and SD, respectively. In the rnetastable region of the phase diagi·arn, an increase in the free energy of the solution due to the sufficient increase in the concentration fluctuations in the polyn1er solution causes the phase separation to occur by the NG rnechaniSin. Consequently, phase separated droplet-type rnorphology develops and grows over tirne, where the direction of the diffusional flux is said to be do-vvnhill (frorn higher concentration to lower concentration) as indicated by the downward arrows in Figure 1.3 at time, t 1 (downhill diffusion - typical of NG). Pattern forrnation as a result of the phase separation b:y the NG mechanism is shown in Figure 1.3 during the times , t 2 and t 3 , which is indicative of the developn1ent and growth of the phase separated regions or domains over the time. In the spinodal region or unstable region of the phase diagram, infinitesimal concentration fluctuations in the polyn1er solution are sufficient to drive or initiate the phase separation by the SD n1echanisn1. Thus, phase separation by the SD rnechanisn1 is a spontaneous process as there is no need of activation energy to overcome any energy barrier. The direction of the diffusional flux is said to be uphill (fron1 low concentration to higher concentration) as indicated by the upward arrows in Figure 1.4 at tirne, t 1 (uphill diffusion - typical of SD ). The phase separation process by the SD rnechanisrn is cmnprised of three stages: early stage, interrnediate stage and late stage (refer to Figure 1.4). The phase separated regions (droplet/interconnected morphology) grow over the tirne fron1 initial stage to intern1ediate stage and become larger and larger a.s time passes due to coarsening of the phase separated regions a.t the late stage of phase separation by SD.

Methods of Phase Separation

There are several rnet.hods of polyrner phase separation available for manufacturing of the structural anisotropic materials, i.e. PDLC systems , microporous polyn1eric rnembranes etc. Out of these methods, Thermal-Indttced Phase Separat'i on (TIPS) and PolyrnerizationInduced Phase Separation (PIPS) rnethods are the most con1rr1only used rnethods industri-

ally for the fonnation of above mentioned materials [27] and therefore, these two rnethods will be described. Other than these rrwthods, the Solvent-lnd'Uced Phase Separation (SIPS) method [27] is also used for the preparation of the above rnentioned polyn1eric composites rnaterials.

1.3.1

Thermal-Induced Phase Separation (TIPS) Method

PDLC films and rnicroporous synthetic (polymeric) mernbranes are produced by this nwthod, which relies on therrr1ally driven phase separation process called Therrnal-Indttced
Phase Separation (TIPS) [27]. In the TIPS rnethods, a polymer solution is rapidly cooled

(quenched) (in case of the UCST solutions) or heated (in case of LCST solutions) in such a way that the conditions of the polyrner solution falls in the spinodal region of the phase cliagrarn frorn its initial homogeneous single phase condition, and consequently, it causes the phase separated regions to fonn within the solution. Polymer solutions undergoing TIPS via the spinodal dec01nposition (SD) n1echanisrn rnay develop a droplet-type morphology (co <
Cc

and c0 > cc) or interconnected-type structure (c0

= cc) depending on the

initial concentration, (c0 ) [28, 4]. Critical (off-critical) initial concentrations result in the interconnected-type structure (droplet-type rnorphology). Functional polyrneric materials norrnally require the droplet-type morphology that develops and evolves during the early and intennediate stages of SD before significant droplet coarsening occurs in the late stage of SD. Application of a temperature gradient [22] or a concentration gradient [19] causes an anisotropic droplet-type morphology to forrn, where the droplet size varies along the gradi-

9

ent direction, but is uniform within the plane norn1al to the gradient direction. Therefore, it is important to have an understanding of the 1norphological development and evolution during the thenna.l-induced phase separation (TIPS) rnethocl by the SD rnechanism in polyrner systen1s in order to control the ma.nufacturing process of functional polymeric materials, since product perforrnance largely depends on the rnorphology and droplet size in the polymeric materials.

Figure 1..5 illustrates the TIPS method of phase separation by the SD rnechanisrn in a polyrner solution. Selection of the quench temperature, T 1 and initial average concentration, c0 of the polyrner solution depends on the end use of the polyrneric phase separated 1nicro-structures to be forn1ed. As sho·wn in Figure 1.5, three distinct routes or process paths of the TIPS method via the SD rnecha.nisrn describe two different resultant morphologies: the droplet-type morphologies and the interconnected-type structures. In the case of the critical quench (route B in which initial average concentration, c0 is chosen to be the the critical concentration,
Cc

of the solution in the phase diagrarn.), the resultant

morphology is of interconnected-type structures, and in the case of the off-critical quench (route A or C in which initial average concentration of the solution, c0 is chosen to be less than or greater than the critical concentration,
Cc

of the solution, respectively.), the

droplet-type rnorphology results [4]. The black regions represent the solvent-rich regions and the white regions represent the polymer-rich regions. The TIPS rnethod via the SD mecha.nisrn, following the route A, is the most widely and extensively used for the rnanufa.cturing of the functional polyrneric rna.terials, such as PDLC and rnicroporous synthetic n1ernbranes industrially. Other process routes have also been studied during the course of this research thesis.

1.3.2

Polymerization-Induced Phase Separation (PIPS) method

The polyrnerization-induced phase separation (PIPS) method has proved to be the rnost useful in fonning the durable filrns with good electro-optical properties, though it is rnore c01nplex process than the conventional thermal-induced phase separation (TIPS) rnethod as it involves both the process of phase separation or de-rnixing as well as the process of polymerization sirnultaneously [11 , 29]. Unlike the TIPS 1nethod, the PIPS method is usually irreversible as the crosslinking between the polyrner chains is easily accomplished.
11

Because of this crosslinking, the polyrner rnatrix in the resulting film can be quite durable, leading to an excellent stability of the PDLC device properties. It is usually quite easy to change the chernical nature of the matrix in PIPS systems. The inherent flexibility in the polymerization process rnakes a wide variety of starting n1aterials both possible and readily available. In PIPS rnethods, as the nmne in1plies, the phase separation is induced by converting the reactive rnonomer into the polyrner through the process of polymerization.

In the PIPS method, first of all, a homogeneous single phase solution is prepared by n1ixing reactive rnonomers and non-reactive solvent at an initial average concentration, c0 and initial tern perature, ~. This point on the phase diagrmn is called the C'Ure point (black dot in Figure 1.6). Thus, the PIPS process starts with stable single-phase hmnogeneous mixture. The reactive monmners are then allowed to polyrnerize either by photo-initiation or therrnal-initiation process. As the polyrnerization proceeds, the n1olecular weight of the polyrner increases along with the solute degree of polyrnerization. As a result, the equilibrium curves , i.e. binodal and spinodal curves , of the polymer on the phase diagrarn shifts towards the higher solvent concentration and temperature (refer to Figure 1.6). One concern regarding PIPS systems is that it can be tricky to achieve uniforrn properties across a cell, or create n1any devices with exactly same properties.

The phase separation process is sensitive to temperature, light intensity (in photo-cured systerns), the presence of in1purities, the solubility characteristics and rnolecular weight of the starting rnaterials. Variations in the phase separation process can lead to different rnatrix morphologies, which in turn affect the perforrnance of the functional polyrneric materials. Great care rnust be taken in PIPS systems to achieve reproducible and unifonn devices.

The Phenomenon of Ludwig-Soret Effect

A ternperature gradient applied to a liquid rnixture not only causes a heat flux, but also gives rise to a diffusion current of the constituent cornponents. The resulting separation of the con1ponents causes the fonnation of a concentration gradient parallel or antipara.llel ':vith respect to the te1nperature gradient. This cross-effect between temperature and concentration is known a.s L·u dwig-Soret e.ffect or therrnal diffus·i on [30 , 31]. Cornpared to other transport properties, therrnal diffusion has not been rnuch studied by con1puter simulations for TIPS n1ethods of phase separation in polymer solutions under ten1perature

gradient. During the last decade, however, a couple of different sirnulation 1nethods have been applied to a few systems, aiming both at detern1ination of numerical values of the Soret coefficient and at a better understanding of the phenornenon. Since its discovery by Ludwig (1856) and the first systernatic investigations in liquid n1ixture by Soret (1879), the effect has been subject to experimental and theoretical studies. They observed a direct thennodiffusion in which a difference of a solute concentration (and thus , the rnatter flow) is caused by a ternperature gradient. In particular, they found that the change in concentration occurs in a tube , which is filled with an initially hornogeneous salt solution and has both ends kept at different temperatures. For instance, they showed that for a solution of sodiurn chloride (NaCl), the salt concentration at the heated end of tube decreases , while at the cold end, it increases [31). Furthermore, the effect is widely used in several industrial processes , such as separation of isotopes, polyrner characterization, separation of products in a porous catalyst in chernical reactors, condensing a vapour rnixture on a cold surface, and water injection in oil reservoir. All of these industrial processes have in con1n1on that they involve a rnixture subject to a te1nperature gradient. This research thesis attempts to investigate and understand the effect of the thern1al diffusion on the overall TIPS method of phase separation in a binary polyrner solution under the influence of the externally irnposed te1nperature gradient across the san1ple numerically and analyzes the morphological and statistical aspects of the polyn1er phase separation.

This chapter provides the literature review on the subject of the polyrner phase separation in regards to its industrial applications and also in regards to the n1ethods used to carry out the polyn1er phase separation process. This research work is limited to polymer phase separation n1ethod of thermal-induced phase separation (TIPS) via the SD n1echanisrn, as it is one of the n1ost \videly used methods for the forn1a.tion of many functional polymeric materials, such as poly1ner dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) filn1s, n1icroporous polymeric 1ne1nbranes & foa.rns etc. This chapter also presents the literature review on the subject of thermal diffusion phenomenon in polyrner solutions under a non-uniforn1 te1nperature field.

Tl1ermal-Indttced Phase Separation Method

Thern1al-inducecl phase separation (TIPS) has been the n1ost widely used n1ethod for formation of the polymeric anisotropic functional rnaterials, such as polyrner dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) devices as well the n1icroporous synthetic rnaterials (i.e. rnernbranes, foan1s etc) since its invention by Castro in early 1980s [32]. There have been several numerical studies carried out for the investigation of the thern1ally-induced phase separation (TIPS) rnethod of phase separation in polyn1er solutions, specially by Chan and Rey [28, 33] in the last decade.

15

Lee et al [22] developed a t\vo-dirnensional rnathernatical rnodel describing the thernralinduced phase separation (TIPS) phenomenon via the spinodal decomposition (SD) nrechanism in polynrer solutions using the non-linear Cahn-Hilliard theory and the Flory-Huggins theory under an externally imposed spatial ternperature gradient. The nurnerical results, in forrn of the spatial concentration profiles and patterns, indicated that isotropic morphology resulted from a unifornr quench (no ternperature gradients), while anisotropic rnorphology fon11ed in case of a non-unifonn quench (in presence of ternpera.ture gradient) . The n1orphological analysis of the shape factor showed that the forrnation of droplet shape was independent of the spatial temperature gradient. Tran et al [34, 35] presented the conlputational stud)r of the rnorphology development and evolution during the thennal-induced phase separation phenomenon via SD n1echanisrn for a sym1netric polyn1er blend in order to understand and control the morphology formation and evolution in the polyrner blends to fabricate functional polynreric cornposite nraterials with predefined material properties and characteristics. The non-linear Cahn-Hilliard and the Flory-Huggins theories were used to n1odel the TIPS method of phase separation via SD rnechanisn1. Their sinlula.tion results indicated that the n1aximum light-scattering intensity increased exponentially during the early stage and early part of the intennediate stage and then slowed down during the later part of intern1ediate stage and late stage of the SD through the structure factor calculations. The sirnulation results also showed that the dinrensionless diffusion coefficient n1ight be 1nanipulated to control the formation and evolution of the morphology during the SD to custonrize the functional polyn1eric materials' properties and characteristics. Jiang and Chan [19] presented the nurnerical results of rnathenratical rnodel that described the two-din1ensional TIPS phenonrenon via SD rnechanisn1 in polyrner solution with linear concentration gradient (non-uniform quenches) and the com paris on with the conventional TIPS process (uniform quench). Unlike the conventional TIPS process (unifornl quench), the morphological development in the polyrner solution vvas found to be a graded size distribution, i.e. anisotropic structures, for the case of non-uniform quench (in

16

presence of linear initial concentration gradient) in their c01nputational study. Apart from above referred general computational studies, there has also been significant amount of experin1ental as well as son1e numerical or cornputational studies perforrned in regards to the specific applications, i.e. fonnation of PDLC filrns, rnicroporous synthetic n1ernbranes etc., which will be illustrated in following subsections.

2.1.1

Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal (PDLC) Films

Polyn1er-dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) cornposites have been the subject of research for many years due to their applications in electro-optical devices, such as flat panel displays, switchable windows etc [11). A PDLC filrn is composed of a polyn1er binder and a larger nurnber of liquid crystal (LC) rnicrodroplets or dornains dispersed in it. Con1monly · used materials for the formation of PDLC filrns are polymethyl methacrylate (Pl\!Il\1A) and polyvinylforrnal (PVF) as polyn1eric rnatrix and 4-cyano-4-pentyl biphenyl (5CB) liquid crystals dispersed in it. A simple and the rnost comn1on rnethod for preparation of PDLC filrns is to exploit phase separation mechanisn1 by the thermally-induced phase separation (TIPS) rnethod. Thern1ally-induced phase separation (TIPS) process is useful in situations, where the polyrneric n1alarial ernployed is readily melted. In this n1ethod, the liquid crystal is usually dissolved in a polyrner melt, yielding a homogeneous solution. A thin filrn is then produced and rnaterial is cooled to induce phase separation followed by solidification. Other rnethods of phase separation for preparation of PDLC filrns include the solvent-induced phase separation (SIPS) and polyrnerization-induced phase separation (PIPS).

The pivotal work for studying the n1orphological control and structural analysis in preparation of PDLC film started in the late 1980s [36, 37, 38]. Since then, there has been a continuous research work going on in the area of modification and irnprovement of the properties of PDLC fihns for better perfonnance. West [36] successfully studied and inves17

tigated TIPS rnethod of phase separation for preparation of PDLC films using the therrnoplastic polyrner-LC systern of Epon 828 and t-butylarnine. It was dernonstrated that the rate of cooling of the polyn1er melts affected the resulting droplet morphology. Rapid cooling resulted in smaller dimneter and rnore LC rernaining in the binder, whereas the slower cooling resulted in larger droplets, which was because slower cooling allowed more tirne for phase separation, droplet growth and droplet coalescence. Under terrestrial conditions, gravitational forces can strongly influence the particle sizes and their distribution via sedirnentation and coalescence, thereby rnaking it difficult to study the irnportance of the intrinsic parameters, which control the process of TIPS for fornration of PDLC filrns. Jin et al [39) analyzed the TIPS process and detennined the critical paran1eters, which controlled the phase separation and the subsequent growth of the liquid crystal droplets in the PDLC systems under rnicrogravity. In their study, the effect of cooling rate was investigated on droplet sizes in the TIPS process both experin1entally and in sirnulation under rnicrogravity environrnents, and found that, in both cases, a faster cooling rate yielded srnaller droplets and irnproved the unifonnity of their dispersions in the polymer binder. However, the sin1ulation results indicated that surface interaction energy played a rnajor role in setting up surface barriers, which hindered the growth. Their sirnulations results were found be in good agreen1ent with the experimental results as far as final droplet sizes were concerned. Teixeira and l\1ulder [40] developed a model of polyrner-dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) formation by the thennally-induced phase separation (TIPS) via spinodal decomposition (SD) mechanism for the systern consisted of thennoplastic polyrner-LC rnixture using the cell dynarnical systerns (CDS) rnethod of Oono and Puri, suitably rnodified to describe a continuous ternperature quench. Like others, the finalrnorphology of PDLC was found to be dependent on the quench rate. Chan [4) modelled and simulated the forrnation of PDLC films via TIPS as well as PIPS rnethod of phase separation via the SD nrechanisrn using the non-linear Cahn-Hilliard (C-H) theory and the Flory-Huggins (F-H) theory. The nurnerical rnethod of Galerkin finite elernent was used to solve the linearized
18

fourth-order Cahn-Hilliard (C-H) equation in his study. The sirnulation results indicated that the droplet size decreased with increas ing the diffusion coefficient, and eventually resulted in higher droplet density, vvhereas the droplet size increased with decreasing the diffusion coefficient and eventually resulted in lesser droplet density for the TIPS method of phase separation. Sirnilarly, a higher quench (shallow quench) temperature resulted in srnaller droplet size and
high(~r

droplet density, whereas a lo\ver quench tern perature (deep Fron1

quench) resulted in bigger droplet size and corresponding lower droplet density.

these siinulation findings, it was concluded that the droplet size and density of the PDLC con1posites were dependent on the diffusion coefficient and quench ternperature of the phase separating solution or system. Vv'hitehead and Gill [41] experirnentally studied and investigated the formation of PDLC filn1s via TIPS rnethod using scanning electron microscopy (SElVI) for a system consisted of thiol-ene based pre-polyrner and LC conrponents such as 4-pentyl-4-cya.nobiphenyl (K15) , 4-heptyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (K21) and 4-octyloxy-4cyanobiphenyl (IVI24). Their SElVI results indicated that PDLC droplet size decreased with increasing cure ternperature above the phase separation temperature for the respective liquid crystal pre-polyrner mixture, whereas the PDLC droplet size increased \Vith increasing liquid crystal conrposition in the liquid crystal pre-polyrner mixtures cured at a constant ternperature above the therrnal phase separation ternperature. Based on these findings , it ·was concluded that a careful choice of cure temperature and the an1ount of liquid crystal were required to n1anipulate the PDLC rnorphology and thus, PDLC electro-optical properties.

2.1.2

l\1icroporous Synthetic Membranes

lVIicroporous synthetic n1en1branes are prepared by a variety of rnethods, including sintering of ceramic, graphite, metal or crystalline polyrner powders; stretching of extruded homogeneous polyolefin or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filrns ; track etching of horno-

19

geneous polycarbonate or polyester films; and phase inversion solution casting of variety of polyrners [42). While each of these rnernbrane preparation n1ethods have their own advantages, the therrnally-induced phase separation (TIPS) rnethod is perhaps the rnost versatile and the sin1plest one for fonnation of the rnicroporous polyrneric rnaterials , such as membranes , foarns etc [43, 44]. TIPS has been used for fornwtion of the rnicroporous polyn1eric membranes of controlled pore characteristics frmn a variety of crystalline and thennoplastic polymers, including polyolefins, condensation and oxidation polyrners, copolyrners, and blends [32, 20, 21, 45). Comrnercially available TIPS polypropylene n1ernbranes have proved useful in cross-flow rnicrofiltration (46, 47] and plasmapheresis [48] and also have been investigated for possible use in rnernbrane distillation [49). Other uses of n1icroporous TIPS men1branes include separators in electrochemical cells, synthetic leather, "breathable" rainwear and diapers, as well as surgical dressings and bandages.

In its sin1plest form, the TIPS process is n1ade up. of following steps:
1. A single phase hornogeneous polymer solution is formed by n1elt-blending a poly-

rner with a high boiling, low n1olecular weight liquid or solid referred to as diluent (solvent) . 2. The solution is then cast into the desired shape. 3. The cast solution is cooled to induced the phase separation and solidification of the polyrner. 4. The solvent is then rernoved either by solvent evaporation process or solvent extraction process to produce a rnicroporous structure. TIPS rnethod is distinguished frorn the fan1iliar non-solvent-induced phase inversion method of n1ernbrane preparation in at least one important aspect . In TIPS rnethocl, the single phase homogeneous solution, frmn which the n1en1brane is fonnecl, is converted to a two 20

phase rnixture via the ren1oval of thern1al energy rather than by the slower exchange of non-solvent for solvent. TIPS rnethod of n1icroporous n1embrane preparation has several advantages over other methods of membrane preparation, which include the following: · The TIPS process is applicable to a wide range of polyrners, including the polymers that, because of poor solubility, could not be formed into rnernbranes via the traditional non-solvent-induced phase inversion. In this regards , one of the distinct advantages of TIPS n1ethod is its ability to prepare n1en1branes frorn semi-crystalline polyrners. · TIPS rnethod is capable of producing a variety of rnicrostructures [42,50 ,32,45 ,20,21] and because of its versatility, it is the rnost popular and useful methods for the fonnation of variety of rnicrostructural rnaterials. · TIPS method is capable of producing relatively thick isotropic microporous structures suitable for controlled release. Fonnation of anisotropic n1icroporous structure is also possible, if a therrnal gradient is induced in step 3 of the men1brane preparation procedure outline above [20, 21]. · As the phase separation by TIPS method is thennally induced rather than nonsolvent exchange induced, it involves fewer variables, which need to be controlled , and as a result, the desired n1icroporous membranes with a controlled characteristics can be produced with a great ease. Following the four step procedure outlined above, the microporous polyrneric rnernbranes can be formed via solid-solid phase separation or via liquid-liquid phase separation with subsequent solidification of the polyn1eric systern. There has been a great arnount of experirnental research work carried out for the betterment of the properties of these rnicroporous polymeric mernbranes formed by TIPS n1ethod for last two decades or so.

Lloyd et al [.50] studied the fonnati.on of rnicroporous crystalline polyn1er rnen1branes via thennally-induced solid-liquid phase separation of polyrner-solvent n1ixture experirnentally. In their work, the thennally-induced solid-liquid phase separation process was studied in terrns of the solution thern1odyna.rnics of binary rnixture and the crystallization kinetics. The polyrneric n1aterials, investigated by then1 for the rnembrane formation1 were polypropylene, high density polyethylene, polychlorotrifluoroethylene, poly( 4nlethyl-1-pentene) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) etc. Lloyd et al [.51] also studied nlicroporous rnembrane forn1ation via thennally-induced liquid-liquid phase separation of isotactic polypropylene- n, n- bis ( 2-hydroxyethyl) tallowrnine rnixture experimentally, of course and in their work, they successfully dernonstrated that rnicroporous rnernbranes could be produced by liquid-liquid phase separation followed by solidification of the polynwr or by solid-liquid phase separation. Kirn et al [52] exan1ined the role of diluent mobility and crystallization temperature in the formation of synthetic membranes via thermally-induced solid-liquid phase separation method in the systems of isotactic polypropylene/n-alkane and isotactic polypropylene/ n-fatty acid systerns. Kirn and Lloyd [53] a1so experinlentally investigated the effect of therrnodyna.rnic interactions on the structure of isotactic polypropylene membranes. On the other hand, Chiang and Lloyd [54] investigated the effect of dissolution temperature and polyrner concentration on the nucleation density and subsequently, on the structure of n1embranes rnade by the solid-liquid TIPS process. They realized that the phase separation proceeded via the nucleation and growth (NG) mechanisn1 to yield the droplet-type rnorphology (connnon in NG quench), when the rate of cooling was slow. On the other hand, they also observed the phase separation to proceed via the spinodal decomposition (SD) mechanisn1, when the rate of cooling was faster and obtained the interconnected-type structure for critical quench of the polymer solution (typical of SD quench).

There has also been several experilnental studies carried out for the investigation of the 22

effect of various process paran1eters on the properties and structure of the rnicroporous rnembranes forn1ation by the liquid-liquid TIPS process. Grahan1 and rvicHugh [55] studied the kinetics of liquid-liquid TIPS rnethod of phase separation and crystallization during thennal quenching of a polypropylene copolyrner in anisole solution using srnall angle light scattering (SALS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning electron n1icroscopy (SElVI), and they realized the cessation of dmnain growth, when the solution temperature crossed the crystallization ternperature. l\1atsuymna et al [56, 16] studied

the effect of the cooling rate and the quench ternperature on the membrane structures forn1ed via liquid-liquid TIPS method and successfully created anisotropic or asymrnetric rnernbrane structures for the systern of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and diphenyl ether (DPE) by allowing the melted solution to evaporate from one side, thereby creating a polyiller concentration gradient in the smnple before the cooling or quenching. These kinds of the anisotropic rnernbranes structures, with gradation in pore size, are highly desirable for the some n1icrofiltration
(l\~IF)

and/ or ultrafiltration (UF) application. Corn pared

with isotropic rnembranes with similar retention, anisotropic rnernbranes show significant irnprovement in permeability and throughput. In a further study of the properties and structural control of 1nicroporous rnernbrane, l\ilatsuyama et al [56, 17, 57, 58, 59] also studied the liquid-liquid as well as solid-liquid TIPS nwthod of rnernbrane forn1ation for various polyrneric systerns in order to investigate the effect of various pararneters, such as polymer rnolecular weight [58], diluent [57] and diluent evaporation rate or cooling rate [.56, 17], extraction and drying [.59] .

Other than above rnentioned experimental studies, rru:my nu1nerical studies have also been perforrned for the investigation of the forn1ation and structural analysis of the 1nicroporous polyrneric rnembranes. lVIany of these studies have revealed the fact that the spinodal decomposition (SD) rnechanisrn plays the 1nost important role in the TIPS nrethod of phase separation during the forrnation of the 1nicroporous menrbranes. Caneba and Soong [21]

23

were perhaps the first ones who rnodelled and simulated the conventional thennal inversion rnethod of liquid-liquid phase separation for formation of the anisot ropic membranes using the Flory-Huggins (F-H) theory for the polyn1er solution therrnodynarnics and the linearized Cahn-Hilliard theory for the spinodal decomposition (SD) n1echanisrn. In their findings, it was observed that the growth period was relatively short con1pared with induction and coarsening tirnes . In addition, it was also realized that the induction period increased with the phase separation ternperature. They concluded fron1 their rnodelling and silnulation work that the linear theory could adequately predict the relevant pore sizes of thermal-cast rnernbranes .

On the other hand , Barton et al [60] used a n1odel based on the non-linear Cahn-Hilliard theory to sirnulate the structure fonnation in thermally quenched polyrner solution in tht\ vicinity of a glass transition, which was found to be in excellent agreernent with their experirnental work done on the phase separation dynmnics in the Pl\!ll\!IA/ cyclohexanol systern. It was concluded that the non-linear Cahn-Hilliard theory for SD n1echanisrn could be ernployed for prediction of the rnicroporous structural development during the early stage as well as the late stage of SD. Barton and l'vlcHugh [61] also portrayed the used of droplet growth rate data, obtained frmn the light scattering rneasuren1ents and/ or spinodal decmnposition calculations, to rnodel the evolution of pore size gradients in solutions undergoing ten1perature-induced phase inversion and demonstrated the effects of quench ternperature on the transient and final pore size distribution in the quenched films (rnernbranes). Grahan1 et al [62] used the small-angle light scattering (SALS) and scanning electron microscopy (SElVI) to study the rnorphology developrnent in P:NilVIA membranes fonned by the TIPS rnethod of phase separation. Their nurnerical analysis of the early tin1e behavior of the scattered intensity in terms of Cahn-Hilliard theory established the spinodal decornposition (SD) mechanisrn as the rnechanisrn of phase separation for the conditions studied. l\!Iatsuyanra et al [6:3] perfonned kinetic studies of thermally-induced

phase separation (TIPS) method of n1icroporous mernbranes formation for polyn1er-diluent systern composed of polypropylene/nwthyl salicylate. Their results showed a good fit with the linear Cahn-Hilliard theory of the spinodal decomposition (SD) rnechanism.

2. 2

Thermal Diffusion Phenomenon in Polymers

Isothern1al static and dynarnical properties of polyrner blends/solution have been all well established [8, 64], but not many non-isothermal studies on phase separating polyrners in the presence of a non-uni.forn1 temperature field have been carried out so far. Although , there have been smne experimental [65, 66, 67] as well as nun1erical [68, 22] studies reported in the literature on the phase separating polyn1er solutions and/ or polyrner blends under the influence of externally applied temperature gradient in recent tin1es. None of these studies have taken into account the Luclwig-Soret effect, which leads to the n1ass flux as a result of externally applied temperature gradient across the polyrner solution/blend.

Krekhov et al [69, 70] theoretically investigated the phase separation phenomena for polymer blends by rnodeling and sitnulating the coupled equations of heat and the extended Cahn-Hilliard equation incorporating the Ludwig-Soret effect or therrnal diffusion phenornenon in presence of spatial periodic temperature rnodulations for the critical polyn1er blendjn1ixture. Their si1nulations produced a periodic kink-type patterns formation in the polymer sarnple dmnain. It was also determined, in one-dimension as well as twodimensions, the critical forcing arnplitude necessary to produce a periodic stripe pattern frorn s1nall randon1 initial conditions, which depended weakly on wave nurnber. It was also demonstrated from their experirnental work that long-living spatial variation patterns with lifetin1es of rnany hours could be written into polyrner blend in the vicinity of its critical point by local laser heating. Reasonable agreen1ent was demonstrated between their experiinental and theoretical work. Enge and Kohler [71, 72] employed a holographic grating

25

technique for the measurernent of diffusion and, for the first tirne, thermal diffusion properties of a critical polyrner blend of poly( dirnethyl siloxane) (PDlVIS) and poly( ethylrnethyl siloxane) (PEl\18). Experinwntal results showed that the Ludwig-Soret effect played an essential role in phase separating polyn1er systems subjected to temperature gradient. It was also concluded from their work that even srnall ternperature differences could cause substantial cornposition changes, which could not be neglected in the treatrnent of nonisothermal phase separation. Rauch and Kohler [73 , 74] investigated n1a.ss and thermal diffusion in polystyrene (PS) /toluene solutions over the whole concentration range from dilute to concentrated. The collective rnass diffusion, therrnal diffusion and Soret coefficients were detennined for the PS/toluene solution by a transient holographic grating technique and photon correlation spectroscopy. It was realized that the Soret coefficient, which was given by ratio of thermal diffusion to collective mass diffusion, was insensitive to the glass transition and followed the scaling law in the serni-dilute to concentrated polyn1er solutions without glass transition.

de Gans et al [75] presented the results on the thennodiffusion of poly( ethylene oxide) (PEO) in ethanol/water rnixture using the Ther·mal Diffusion Forced Rayleigh Scattering (TDFRS) technique. In these TDFRS experiinents, the PEO was found to migrate towards the region of lower ternperature in water-rich solvent mixture. This is typical for polyn1er solutions and corresponds to a positive Soret coefficient of PEO. In solvent-rich rnixtures, however, the polyn1er was found to rnigrate towards the higher temperatures, corresponding to a negative Soret coefficient of a polymer in solution. Thus, frorn these experimental findings, polymer n10lecules were found to rnove into the direction of the thern1odynan1ically favored preferentially solvating solvent shell cornposition. A sirnple lattice model for the polymer solvent system was presented and Soret coefficients were calculated with statistical n1echanics 1nethods, which were found to be in good agreement with their experiinental results.

Thesis Objectives

As rnentioned earlier, our previous work by Lee et al nurnerically studied the TIPS n1ethod of phase separation in polyn1er solutions under temperature gradient (22]. In their study: the thennal diffusion phenomenon Vilas not taken into consideration. Some researchers around the world pointed out that the Ludwig-Soret effect or the therrnal diffusion phenomenon could not be neglected while studying polyrner solutions under a ternperature gradient, as it also contributes to the overall phase separation mechanism in polymer solutions. Therefore, the n1ain objective of this research thesis is to study the Ludwig-Soret effect (Thennal Diffusion) on the thennal-induced phase separation (TIPS) rnethod via the SD mechanism in polymer solutions vvith an externally imposed spatial tmnperature gradient through rnathen1atical n1oclelling and computer sin1ulations. An ernphasis has been placed specifically on the understanding of the influence of the therrnal-diffusion phenornenon on the overall process of phase separation (TIPS in this case) under the spinodal or unstable region of the phase diagrarn in a binary polyrner solution. The sequential objectives of the research thesis are as follow:
1. To develop a n1athernatica.l rnodel (one dirnensional as well as two dimensional) ,

which describes the overall process of phase separation (i.e. TIPS via SD only) in a binary polymer solution sarnple involving therrnal diffusion phenornenon (LudwigSoret effect) under an externally irnposed spatial linear tern perature gradient. The binary polymer solution san1ple is well suited for the TIPS method, as it is one of the rnost comn1only used n1ethods for the fabrication of functional anisotropic polymeric rnaterials, i.e. PDLC films, rnicro-porous synthetic rnembranes etc. The theories, which will be taken into account during the developrnent of the rnathen1aticalrnodel for the research thesis : are the non-linear Cahn-HiUiard theory describing the TIPS method via the SD mechanisn1, Flory- Huggins theory describing the thennodynamics of polyn1er solutions, and theory of Ludwig-Soret effect describing the therrnal diffu27

sion phenornenon prevailing in a polyrner solution under a non-unifonn ternperature field. 2. To irnplernent, solve and validate a one-dimensional rnodel as specified and developed in the above rnentioned objective 1 for the TIPS rnethod involving the thennal diffusion phenomenon. An ernphasis is placed on the understanding of the influence of the thennal diffusion phenomenon on the overall phase separation rnechanisrn (TIPS via SD) in binary polymer solutions under an externally imposed spatial linear tenrperature gradient by cornparing the spatial structural profile (i.e. spatial concentration profile), obtained with and without thennal diffusion phenomenon. 3. To in1plernent, solve and validate a two-dirnensional rnodel as specified and developed in the above rnentioned objective 1 for the TIPS rnethod involving the thermal diffusion phenon1enon. Again, an ernphasis is placed on the understanding of the influence of the thermal diffusion phenornenon on the overall phase separation mechanisrn (TIPS via SD) in binary polyrner solutions under an externally imposed spatial linear ten1perature gradient by analyzing the structural morphologies obtained with and without thermal diffusion phenomenon.

CHAPTER 3 MODEL DEVELOP

E T

This chapter presents the theoretical background for development of mathernatical rnodel of the phenonwna of TIPS method of phase separation by the spinodal decon1position (SD) mechanism involving thermal diffusion phenmnenon under the influence of an externally imposed spatial linear tern perature gradient. As mentioned in the previous chapter, the TIPS method of phase separation by the spinodal decmnposition (SD) mechanism is the rnost widely used n1echanisn1 for the fabrication of the functional polyn1eric materials , such as PDLC and rnicroporous synthetic rnernbrane. This research thesis primarily concentrates on the TIPS rnethod of phase separation by the spinodal decomposition (SD) n1echanisn1. Spinodal clecornposition (SD) rnechanism is best described by the well-known non-linear Cahn-Hilliard (C-H) theory, which will be described later in the chapter. This chapter also describes the theory of Ludwig-Soret effect, as it best describes the thern1al diffusion phenornenon prevailing during the TIPS method of phase separation in a polymer solution under the influence of an externally irnposed temperature gradienL

Thermodynamics in Polymer Solutions

As mentioned earlier, the understanding of the thermodynarnics in polyrner solutions is very vital in order to study the phase equilibria, and consequently, the phase separation phenomena in binary polyrner solutions, especially under the influence of externally applied ten1perature gradient across the sarnple. The phase equilibria of a binary polymer

29

solution can be very well described by the Flory-Huggins (F-H) theory. Therefore, the Flory-Huggins theory will be discussed in the chapter , as it describes the free energy of mixing for a binary polyrner solution. And also, the construction of the phase diagran1 of a binary polymer solution using the Flory-Huggins theory will be illustrated later in the chapter.

T'he fundarnental therrnodynarnic equation to describe the systerns, such as polymer rnixture relates the Gibbs free energy of mixing, ~GM to the enthalpy of n1ixing, !j._HA1 and the entropy of n1ixing,

when the Gibbs free energy of solution, G 12 is lower than the Gibbs free energies of the constituent components of the rnixture in pure state, G 1 and G2 .

(3.2)

3.1.1

The Flory-Huggins Theory
jj._GA1

One of the rnost well-known expression for the free energy of n1ixing,

of a polyrner

solution is the Flory-Huggins (F-H) theory [5, 76), which is based on the two dimensional statistical lattice rnodel. This lattice 1nodel is used to characterize the possible arrangements of the cmnponents ' segn1ents in the polyrner rnixtures. Polyrner solutions are considered as the irregular nonideal solutions , in which both !j._HAI and f::l.SM deviate from their ideal values. To understand the behavior of polyrners in solution rnore fully, the knowledge of enthalpic and entropic contributions to .6..GA1 is essential.

30

For a systen1 in a given state, the entropic contributions, also referred to as the cornbinatorial contributions, are related to the nurnber of distinguishable arrangements the

components in that state can adopt. These entropic contributions can be expressed by following equation derived from the Boltzrnann's law ofentropy based on the two dirnensional statistical lattice model for the polymer solutions as follows [5]:

tiS'M

= - kB

u

[~Inc+
IV 1

(l- c) Jn(l- c)]
~TV2

where, kB is the Boltzmann's constant, IV1 and N 2 are the nurnber of molecules or degree of polyrneriza.tion of the cornponent 1 (solvent) and 2 (solute), respectively; c is the concentration of the cornponent 1 (solvent in this case) in terms of its volume fraction in the mixture; and u is the volume of the cell or segm.ent.

The enthalpic

contributions~

also referred to as non-com,binatorial contributions, are due

to the interactions of polymer molecules with solvent rnolecules, and are rnuch harder to quantify. The derivation of D.SM frorn the lattice theory has been made on the assurnption that no heat or energy change occurs on rnixing. This is an uncornmon situation as experimental experience suggests that the energy change is finite. The theory of the regular solution is utilized in order to obtain the expression for D.H 1VI, where this change in energy is assumed to arise from the formation of new solvent-polymer interactions on mixing, which replace sorne of the solvent-solvent and polymer-polyrner interactions present in the pure solvent and pure polyrner cornponents, respectively. Thus, based on the lattice model for the polyn1er solutions , the expression for the enthalpic contributions can be presented as follows [5]:

Now, combining Equations (3.3) and (3 .4) into Equation (3.1) to give the expression for the Gibbs free energy of rnixing, 6.GM or the Flory-Huggins free energy, .f(c) as follows [5]:

Phase Equilibria and Phase Diagram

The Flory-Huggins theory can be used to predict the equilibriun1 behavior of two liquid phases , when both contain amorphous polymer and one or two solvents. Consider a twocornponent syste1n consisting of a cornponent 1 (solvent) and cmnponent 2 (polyrner). Complete rniscibility occurs, when the Gibbs free energy of rnixing, t::..GA1 is less than the Gibbs free energies of the con1ponents, and the solution maintains its homogeneity only as long as ~GM rernains less than the Gibbs free energy of any two possible coexisting phases.

Figure 3.1 represents a schematic diagrarn of the Gibbs free energy of mixing, t:.GM as a function of the solvent concentration (top half), showing the transition frmn a system miscible in all proportions at a ten1perature, T1 through the critical temperature, Tc to partially miscible systems at ten1peratures, T2 to T 4 . The contact points for the comrnon tangents drawn to the rninima of the Gibbs free energy curve for ternperature, T4 are shown projected onto the tern perature-concentration plane to fonn the binodal (cloud point) curve , whereas projection of the inflexion points forn1s the spinodal curve, and the area under the spinodal curve represents the heterogeneous two-phase region, where there is limited solubility of component 2 (polyn1er) in cmnponent 1 (solvent) and vice versa, depending on the location of the quench point (c, T) [5]. This is also called a clo·ud point

c'urve. As the ten1perature is increased, the lirnit of this two-phase coexistence contracts,

The contact points for the cmnmon tangents drawn to the rninin1a are shown projected onto the te1nperature-concentration plane to forrr1 the binodal (cloud point) curve, whereas projection of the inflexion points forms the spinodal curve. The upper diagran1 shows the different Gibbs free energy curves corresponding to the ten1peratures T1 to T4 (T1 > T2 > T3 > T4) [5].

critical .soltdion ternperatv,re. The crit ical solution temperature is an irnportant quantity,
and can be accurately defined in terms of the chernical potential. It represents the point at which the inflexion points on tht: curve n1erge, and so it is the temperature where the first, second and third derivatives of the Gibbs free energy with respect to the solvent concentration are zero.

33

The phase diagram in Figure 3.1 can also be fonned numerically using the Flory-Huggins Equation (3.5) [77]. In order to deterrnine the equilibriun1 (binoclal curve) composition, the Flory-Huggins (F-H) free energy Equation (3.5) and its first derivative with respect to cmnposition are used to find the chen1ical potential of each cornponent in their respective phases. Following are the equations of the chen1ical potential of each component in their respective phases [77] :

Therefore, following two equations are obtained by equating Equation (3.6) with (3.7) and (3.8 ) with (3.9),

(3.11) Now, these two Equations (3.10) and (3.11) are solved simultaneously for values of ct and

c+ to construct the binodal curve, which represents the coexisting phases in equilibriurn.

The theta ten1perature, ()is a well-defined state of a polyrner solution at which the excluded vohune effects are elin1inated, and the polyrner coil is in an unperturbed condition.

The Cahn-Hilliard Theory

The theory of phase separation in hornogeneous single phase solution by spinodal decomposition was first given by J.vV. Cahn back in 1956 [78]. lVIost of the studies for the

kinetics of phase separation were lirnited to rnetals and glasses, but for last two decades or so, the study of the kinetics of phase separation has been extended to polyrner solutions and blends [79] as well. The non-linear Cahn-Hilliard equation, describing the spinodal decornposition
process ~

was derived fron1 continuity equation of mass, which relates the

inter-diffusional flux to the driving force of phase separation, i.e. the gradient in chemical potential.

The continuity equation is expressed as follows:

--::- = -\7. J

ac at

(3.17)

where, c is the concentration of solvent in terms of volume fraction, and J is the intersolvent). The kinetics of the initial stage of phase diffusional flux of the component (i.e. . separation can be obtained sirnply by solving the diffusion equation, in which the interdiffusional flux is related to the gradient in chernical potential by following equation.

(3.18) 36

where, Af is the 1nobility, which is defined by the ratio of the negative of inter-diffusional flux and the gradient in chernical potential. 1\!Iobility is considered to be the function of concentration, which will be discussed later in the chapter. p 1 and p.2 are the che1nical potentials of the cmnponent 1 (solvent) and 2 (polymer) of the binary polyn1er solution, respectively. For simple thermodynmnics considerations, mobility, lvf must be positive if diffusion, which results spontaneously clue to the gradient in chernical potential in the solution, is to result in decrease in the free energy of the syste1n. Now, consider an inhomogeneous binary polymer solution, whose concentration, c differs slightly from its average initial concentration, c0 everywhere with infinitesirnally small concentration gradients. Its total free energy of n1ixing can be given by following expression [78] :

F

Here, f(c) is the Flory-Huggins free energy density of hornogeneous solution of concentration, c whereas K(\7 c)2 represents the changes in the free energy of the solution due to concentration gradients.

Mutual and Self-Diffusion Coefficients

lVIutual diffusion process accounts for the relaxation of the thennal fluctuations in concentration of the binary solution. It describes the rnixing of the con1ponents in the n1ixture

38

through the n1utual diffusion coefficient, D given by following equation:

D=QA

(3.27)

where, Q is the thennodynamic factor related to the static correlation function of concentration fluctuations , and A is a kinetic factor presun1ed to be expressible in tenns of the self-diffusion coefficients of the components of the solution. The thennodynamic factor, Q is expressed as follows [80]:
(3.28)

where:

Jv~1

and JV2 are the degree of polyrnerization of the con1ponent 1 and 2 in the binary

solution, and c and (1 - c) are the volurne fractions of the cornponent 1 and 2 in the binary solution. However, as far as the analytical forrn of A is concerned, there exists two contradictory theories, namely slow rnode theory and fast mode theory, which take into account the self-diffusion coefficients of the individual conrponent of the solution.

The slow mode result is obtained with the randorn-phase approximation under the condition of rnicroscopic incompressibility and on the other hand , the fast mode result is obtained by ignoring the clynarnic correlations between the velocities of different particles [80] . Both these results are expressed as shown below:

or inter-diffusion coefficient corresponding to the

slow rnode theory and the fast rnode theory can be expressed as following in terms of the

39

self-diffusion coefficients [80].

Slow 1\!Iode: Fast J\1ode:

From Equations (3.31) and (3.32) , we can see that, for the case where one species is diffusing much faster than the other (i.e. D 1

>>

D 2 ) , Equation (3.31) predicts that the

interdiffusion is controlled by the slow diffusing cornponent , i.e. D:::::::: D 2 [N2 (1-c)/N1 c+ 1] (slow n1ode theory), while Equation (3.32) predicts that the interdiffusion is controlled by the fast diffusing con1ponent in the rnixture, i.e. D:::::::: D 1 (1- c) 2 [1 + 1V1 c/1V2 (1- c)] (fast n1ode theory). Thus, the mutual diffusion or interdiffusion process is dependent upon the self-diffusion coefficients of the individual cmnponents of the solution. There are several models or theories available, which help in deterrnination of the self-diffusion coefficients of the constituent cornponents of the solution , i.e. the spring-and-bead n1odel, the Rouse theory, the Kirkwood-Risen1an theory and the reptation theory [81]. This research thesis n1akes use of the Rouse theory based on the spring-and-bead rnodel to detern1ine the selfdiffusion coefficient, as it best describes the slow diffusion rnechanism behavior by the low rnolecular weight polyrner solutions such as the ones considered in this work, and therefore, only Rouse theory will be described briefly.

Based on the spring-and-bead model , the Rouse theory assumes that there are no hydrodynamic interactions between the polyrner segrnents, and therefore, the solvent rnolecules are able to move freely through the polymer coil. However, the presence of the solvent rnolecules in the polyrner coils inhibits the movernent of polyrner segrnents, i.e. there exists the molecular friction. l\!Ioreover, this theory is applicable to the systerns having short polyrner chains with no entanglernent effect , which is true for N 2 < 200. Keeping in rnind all these assurnptions, the self-diffusion coefficient, derived frorn the Rouse theory, can be 40

expressed as follo\vs [81,82].

Concentration Dependent Mobility

The n1obility is a rneasure of rate at which the concentration of the n1ixture is dispersed , and is known to be a function of concentration as mentioned earlier. The slow rnode theory states that the mobility, A1 is related to the self-mobilities of the constituent components,
1\111 (i.e. for solvent) and Jv12 (i.e. for polyrner) as:
1 1 1

(3.34)

The individual rnobility of the constituent cornponents can be expressed in tenus of the respective self-diffusion coefficient as:

fori= 1, 2

(3.3.5)

where, ci is the concentration of the component i, i.e. c 1 = c and c2 = (1 - c). Now, substituting the values of the respective self-diffusion coefficients fron1 Equation (3.33) and the respective second derivatives of the Flory-Huggins (F-H) free energy equation from Equation
(~3..5)

into Equation (3 .3.5) to obtain the respective rnobilities of the constituent

The Rouse theory based on the spring-and-bead model, which describes the rnotion of the polyrner chain as spring and bead, can be observed in the concentrated polyn1er solution
[81,83]. Since, we are rnodeling concentrated solutions containing short polyrner chains with

no entanglements and hydrodynamics effects, the Rouse model may be used to express the self-diffusion coefficients. The following expression is obtained for the total rnobility by cmnbining Equations (3.34), (3.36) and (3.37), and assurning no interaction between the two con1ponents (i.e.

6 = ~2 = ~).

The Ludwig-Soret Effect

In this section, the phenon1enon of the L·udwig-Soret elfect or ther,mal diffusion, which arises in a mixture if both the concentrations, and the ten1pera.ture are non-unifonn over the system, will be studied. For the derivation of the equation of the thern1al diffusion, consider the n1ulti-component isotropic fluids in which viscous phenomena may be neglected, and no external forces are present. Under these conditions, the pressure is unifonn over the system if it is assun1ed that rnechanical equilibrium is rapidly established. The entropy

GOVERNING EQUATIO SAN METHOD OF SOLUTIONS
This chapter describes the rnodel development for the TIPS method of phase separation involving the thennal diffusion phenomena under the externally imposed spatial temperature gradient in the binary poly1ner solution. Figure 4.1 shows a flowchart of rnathernatical rnodelling and cmnputational sinnllation procedures utilized in order to accon1plish the objectives of the research thesis. As per Section 2.3, the first and the forernost objective of this thesis is to develop the matheinatical rnodel based on the available theories, such as the non-linear Cahn-Hilliard theory, Flory-Huggins theory and Ltulwig-Soret theory, which altogether best describe the TIPS method of the phase separation in a binary polyrner solution as well as the thennal diffusion phenomenon under an externally irnposed spatial linear ternperature gradient. The ternperature gradient, which is assurned to be linear along the axis (i.e.
~c

or y - axis) in the polyn1er solution, will be defined later in this

chapter. Also mobility, A1 which is assurned to be function of concentration of solution, will be defined. The n1odel is then solved using the appropriate cornputational methods (i.e. numerical n1ethods) and cornputer programn1ing language. Finally, the nun1erical results obtained frmn the cornputer simulation of the matherrw.tical rnodel are analyzed and presented in such a manner that they can be validated with the published experimental and/or numerical results if any.

In this thesis, the following steps \vere followed for the computational n1odelling and sin1ulation of the TIPS n1ethod of the phase separation in the polymer solution involving the thermal diffusion phenon1enon.

1. Specify the independent and the dependent variables of the rnathernatical model.
The independent variables include time and space, where as the dependent variable include the solvent concentration for the TIPS n1ethocl involving the thern1al diffusion phenomenon. 2. Derive the governing tin1e-dependent partial differential equation to describe the TIPS rnethod of phase separation via the SD mechanism in a binary polyrner solution with an externally irnposed spatial linear ternperature gradient along with thermal diffusion phenomenon for the forn1ation of the functional anisotropic n1aterials taking into account above rnentioned independent and dependent variables. The non-linear Cahn-Hilliard theory, the Flory-Huggins theory and Ludwig-Soret theory are used for derivation of the governing equation for the overall process of the phase separation in the binary polymer solution. 3. Derive the appropriate boundary conditions for the study of the process of the phase separation (TIPS) in polyrner solution for the formation of the structural anisotropic polyrneric materials. The boundary conditions used in the derivation of the governing equation are the zero rnass flux and the natural boundary conditions. 4. N ondin1ensionalize the governing equation and boundary conditions obtained in steps 2 and 3, that describe the fonnation of the structural anisotropic polymeric materials by the TIPS method of phase separation via the SD 1nechanism involving the thennal diffusion under the influence of an externally in1posed spatial linear tmnperature gradient in binary polymer solutions and the dilnensionless parmneters obtained are listed.

5. Develop the Galer kin finite elen1ent n1ethod forn1ulations of the dirnensionless governing equation and boundary conditions obtained in step 4, that describe the fonnation of the structural anisotropic polyrneric n1aterials via the TIPS rnethocl of phase separation via. the SD rnechanisrn involving the thennal diffusion under the influence of an externally irnposecl spatia1 linear ternperature gradient in binary polyrner solutions. Galerkin finite elen1ent n1ethod fonnulations include the derivation of equations of the weighted residual vector and the jacobian matrix. 6. Implernent and solve the Galerkin finite element method fonnulations obtained in step 5 by choosing the appropriate dirnensionless pararneter values and with the help of the cmnputer prograrnming language, such as FORTRAN 77. Investigate the influence of the parameters that affect the fonnation of the structural anisotropic polymeric rnaterials via the TIPS rnethod of phase separation via the SD 1nechanisn1 involving the thennal diffusion under the influence of an externally irnposed spatial linear temperature gradient in binary polyrner solutions. 7. Analyze the con1putational shnulation output obtained in step 6 using the scientific visualization rnethods. i.e. 3-D surface plots and contour plots and the n1orphological analysis. 8.

Spatial Temperature Gradient

In this research work, a linear spatial temperature gradient, sirnilar to what Lee et al [22] adopted in their work, has been assurned to exist along a binary polymer solution sample. Following is the expression for an externally irnposed spatial linear temperature gradient across a binary polymer solution samples, which is assurned to exist along the :r:-direction

(4.7)

where, T(:T) is the spatial ternperature, and T 1 and T2 are the lower and upper limits of the linear ternperature gradient corresponding to the positions x 1 and :r 2 on the :r-axis.

For the one-dirnensional study, the linear ternperature gradient is assurned to exist along the study don1ain of length L during the phase separation phenmnena, whereas for the two-dilnensional study, the linear spatial ternperature gradient is assurned to exist only along the
~r-direction

of a square computational domain with the din1ension L x L (i.e.

0 :::;; :r :::;; L and 0 :::;; y :::;; L). It irnplies that there is no temperature gradient along the y-axis in the two dirnensional study (i.e. 8T(y)j8y = 0).

Concentration Dependent Mobility

Unlike the conventional nurnerical studies of the Cahn-Hilliard (C-H) equation, the mobility, 1\1 has been assumed to be the function of concentration of the components in the solution (refer to Section (3.4)). Either the slow mode theory or the fast rnode theory can be em.ployed to calculate the total mobility of polymer solution. The slow rnode theory has been used in this research work, as it better represents the slow diffusion behavior exhibited by a polyrner solution. According the slow rnode theory and in absence of the entanglement effects, the total mobility can be expressed as:

Auxiliary Equatio11s

As n1entioned earlier, the infinitesimal concentration fluctuations are always present in the polyrner solution initially even in the single-phase region. These infinitesimal concentration fluctuations are sufficient to drive the process of phase separation by the spinodal decomposition (SD) 1nechanis1n. Therefore , the expression of the dirr1ensionless initial concentration
56

can be given as:
c*(t* = 0) = c~

+ <Sc*(t*

=

0)

(4.16)

where, c0 is the dirnensionless initial concentration , and 8c* ( t*

= 0) represents any devi-

a.tion from the average initial concentration c0 or the infinitesimally sn1a.ll concentration fluctuations, which rnay be present in the solution. Chan and Rey [28] used the l\'fonte Carlo sirnulations incorporated with the linearization approxirnation and the equipartition theorem in their work for the developn1ent of the expression for the initial condition for the phase separation in polyrner solution.

4.2.1

Boundary Conditions

In order to solve Equations (4.14) and (4.15) nurnerically, two kinds of boundary conditions are taken into consideration: the zero n1ass flux boundary conditions and the natural boundary condition.
The zero 1nass flux boundary condition refers to the system in which it is assumed

that there is no exchange of n1ass with its surrounding. It is obtained by setting Equation (3. 21) equal to zero [84]. For one-dirnensional study, the dimensionless form of the zero mass flux boundary condition can be expressed as follows [28]:

The natural boundary condition is obtained from the variational analysis, and is expressed in generalized fonn as [85]:

(4.20)

where, n is the outward unit normal to a bounding surface. The dirnensionless natural boundary condition for the one-dimensional study is given as:

Method of Solution

As the governing equation derived in the study is a non-linear fourth order partial differential equation, the nurnerical rnethod of finite elen1ent ( Galerk'in finite element m.ethod to be specific) is ernployed to solve it. In the finite elernent rnethod, the dornain is divided into subdomains cmnmonly referred to as finite ele·rnents [86]. These subdomains or elements are called the fundan1ental building block of the finite elernent rnethod. The Galerkin finite elernent n1ethod for the two-dimensional problern is described briefly in the following subsection, and also described are the first order irnplicit Euler predictor-corrector
1nethod (for tirne integration) and an adaptive t-ime-.step control mechanisrn to reduce the

58

computational tirne while maintaining accuracy of the nun1erical solution.

4.3.1

Galerkin Finite Element Method

Consider a general non-linear partial differential equation with appropriate initial and boundary condition as shown below:

Lu(·)-

f =

(4.23)

where, L is a co~efficient of function u(·)~ and

f is an arbitrary constant. Let

tta.

be the

approxirnate solution of the above mentioned partial differential Equation (4.23) and can given by following expression:
N

'Ua(·) =

represents the set of unknown coefficients; ¢j represents the set of linearly in-

dependent functions, which are chosen to be polynornials that satisfy certain boundary conditions irnposed on the given equation; and N is the nurnber of nodes in the spatial discretization of the cmnputational domain. Substitution of u 0 from Equation (4.24) into Equation (4.23) results in the residual R(·) as given below.

LtLa ( ·) -

f

=

R(·) # 0

(4.25)

Here, the objective is to find the set of undetennined coefficients

u.i

such that the residual

is rninirnized in some sense. A straightforward scheme would be to set the double integral of R( ·) to zero for two- dirnensional case to yield the residual vector Fi.

Fi =

R(·) · wi(·)dA =

J}A {

R(·) · ¢i(-)dA = 0

(where i = 1, 2, 3, ... , 1V)

(4.26)

where,

?.Dis

represent the weighting functions. For Galerkin finite element n1ethod, the

weighting functions are chosen to be the basis functions, ¢is (i.e. Hermitian bicubic basis function to be specific). Equation (4.26) yields a set of N independent sirnultaneous equaticms, which can be solved simultaneously with the use of both Newton-Raphson iterative n1ethod and first-order irnplicit Euler predictor-corrector n1ethod.

The Hermitian bicubic basis functions are the appropriate choice for the basis functions for solution of the two-diinensional fourth-order partial differential equations such as the one represented by the governing Equation (4.13). The approximate solution in tv.ro din1ensions is given by

Euler's Predictor-Corrector Method

This subsection briefly describes the first-order in1plicit Euler predictor-corrector rnethod , which is employed for tirne integration of the governing equations. A fundamental source of error in Euler's rnethod is that the derivative at the beginning of the interval is assumed to apply across the entire interval. One rnethod to solve the estin1ate of the slope involves

61

the detennination of two derivatives for the interval, one at the initial point and one at the end point. The two derivatives are then averaged to obtain an improved estin1ate of the slope for the entire interval. This 1nethod is also called H ev:n 8 1nethod, and is depicted graphically in Figure 4.1 in which Figure ?? describes the predictor method (also called
Eulerjs forward rnethod), and Figure?? describes the corrector ·method (also called Euler's backward ·method).

Now, the slope at the beginning of an interval y~

62

the calculation of an slope at the end of the interval:

This average slope is then used to extrapolate linearly frorn y1 to

[6].
(4.39) which is called a Corrector equation. Note that because Equation (4.39) has Yi+l on the both sides of the equal sign, it can be applied in an iterative fashion. That is , an old estin1ate can be used repeatedly to provide an irnproved estirnate of
Yi+l·

It should be

understood that this iterative process does not necessarily converge on the true answer , but will converge on an estirnate with a finite truncation error, following expression.

4.3.3

Time Step-Size Control

There are ways to estirnate the local truncation error (LTE) , and it can be used to adjust the step-size. In general, the strategy is to increase the step-size, if the error is s1nall and decrease it, if the error is large. Press et al. have suggested the following criterion to

63

accomplish this [87]:
hne'ID

Ia

(4.41)

where,

hpresent

and

are the present and the new step sizes, respectively. ~present is the

is the desired accuracy, and n· is a. constant power that
L':lpresent

is equal to 0.2, when the step-size is increased (that is, when when the step-size is decreased ( .6-present >
.6.new) .

:=:;

.6.new)

and 0.25,

Constant Step-Size: In general , experiences indicate that an optimal step-size should be srnall enough to ensure convergence -vvithin three iterations of corrector. In addition, it rnust be srnall enough to yield a sufficiently small truncation error. At the same time, the step-size should be as large as possible to rninin1ize runtirne cost and roundoff errors. As \vith other methods for ODEs, the only practical way to assess the rnagnitucle of the global error is to cornpare the results for the sarne problem but with a halved step-size.

Adaptive Step-Size: It is also called variable step-size. Two criteria are typically used
to decide whether a change in step-size is warranted. First, if Equation 4.40 is greater than some prespecified error criterion, the step-size is decreased. Second, the step-size is chosen so that the convergence criterion of the corrector is satisfied in two to three iterations. The criterion is intended to account for the trade-off between the rate of convergence and the total number of steps in the calculation. }or srnaller step-size, the convergence will be rnore rapid, but more steps are required . For larger step-size, the convergence is slower, but fewer steps result. Experience suggested that the total steps will be rninimized if step-size is chosen so that · the corrector converges within two to three iterations. Therefore, if over two (or three) iterations are required, the step size is decreased and if less less than two (or three) iterations a.re required, the step-size is increased.

64

Finally, the set of Equations (4.33) are solved for the unknown coefficients , CJ . Since this is a set of non-linear tirne dependent ordinary differential equations for cj ' they a.r e solved silnultaneously with a Newton-Raphson iterative n1ethod. The Jacobian matrix of partial derivatives is determined frorn Jii = DFd 8CJ , and the convergence is assurned to occur, when the length of the vector of the difference between two successive cmnputed solution vector is less than 10- 6 . The finite difference rnethod is used to discretize tin1e, and a first-order in1plicit Euler's predictor-corrector 1nethod is used for tilne integration. In order to n1inirnize the cmnputational tirne without losing the accuracy at the same time, an adaptive time step controller suggested by Finlayson (88] is employed. As far as the size of nwsh is concerned , a rnesh of 32 x 32 nodes is ernployed in this cmnputational study. Since each node contains four variables (refer to Equation (4.27)) , the resultant

J a.cobian matrix is of size 4096 x 4096, i.e. a whopping 17 rnillion (approx.) entries in this
matrix alone. In addition, other 1nesh sizes used in this cmnputational study are 21 x 21 and 35 x
3.~.

The nu1nerical results of this cmnputational study were obtained frorn the

simulations performed on SHARCNET High Perforrnance co·mpv.ting Facility (CPU: 4 x Opteron 1@2.2 GHz & RAIVI: 4.0 GB).

USSION

This chapter presents and discusses the sirnulation results obtained by solving the twodirnensional mathernatical n1odel (see Equation (4.15)) representing the phase separation mechanis1n (i.e. TIPS via SD) in binary polyn1er solutions under an externally irnposed spatial linear ten1perature gradient and also involving the therrnal diffusion phenmnenon. This chapter has been divided into the following three sections, which will help us understand and analyze the potential outcornes of the research thesis.

The Str"Ltctures and Patterns Formatio11

Figure 5.1 shows an asymrnetric phase diagram of a binary polymer solution used in this study. The phase diagrarn is a plot of dirnensionless ternperature, T* versus din1ensionless solvent concentration, c* and it has been constructed following the procedure outlined by Kurata (77] ; the procedure is briefly discussed in Subsection 3.1.2, and the parameter values used in the calculation are given in Table B.l in Appendix B. The solid curve represents the binodal curve, and the dashed curve is the spinodal curve. In addition, the three intervals AB, CD , and EF in the unstable region indicate the locations in the

66

phase diagram for which sitnulation results will be presented and discussed in this chapter. These three intervals represent the overall depth of an externally imposed linear spatial temperature gradient across a polytner solution used in the sirnula.tion of the TIPS method of phase separation. Locations of these three intervals in the phase diagrarn highlight the rnain difference in SD pattern forrnation phenmnena. The intervals AB and EF are at off-critical concentrations, (c~ < <) and (c~ > c~), respectively, whereas the interval CD is

, T*) at critical concentration, (c0 = c~). Table 5.1 lists the phase diagrmn coordinates (c0
of these three intervals, which represent the initial conditions used in the sin1ulations.

Note that Table 5.1 represents a srnall sarnple of nurnerous sirnulations perfonned for the study of the phase separated structures and the pattern forrnation during the overall phase separation process (TIPS via SD) involving the therrnal diffusion phenornenon in binary polyrner solutions under an externally imposed spatial linear temperature gradient. The results, based on these sirnulation cases, are reflective of all the simulations performed for this study, and also, these results are sufficient to fulfil the objectives of the thesis. Figure 5.2 shows the time evolution of the dirnensionless spatial concentration profile, c*(1:*, y*) (first column) and patterns (second column) fonned during the phase separation phenornena (TIPS via SD) involving thennal diffusion under an externally imposed spatial linear tern perature gradient corresponding to interval AB in the phase diagran1 (see Figure 5.1), using a dimensionless diffusion coefficient, D* = 8 x 10~) and a dirnensionless thern1al diffusion coefficient, D'* row), t*

This sirnulation represents pattern formation via the SD rnechanism for a non-unifonn offcritical quench case with a dirnensionless initial average concentration, c0 = 0.60, and the resultant rnorphology is of droplet-type. The phase separated structures consist of droplets of solvent dispersed unifonnly in the solute (i.e. polyrner) n1ediurn.

72

Now, analyzing the sirnulation results presented by Figures 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4, it can be depicted that during the phase separation n1echanisrn of TIPS via SD involving the thermal diffusion phenornenon under an externally irnposed spatial linear temperature gradient for non-unifonn off-critical quench cases (intervals AB and EF in Figure 5.1), theresultant pattern or 1norphology fonnation is of droplet-type, whereas for a non-uniforn1 critical quench case (interval CD in Figure 5.1} , the resultant pattern or n1orphology formation is of interconnected-type structures. It should be noted that the pattern or rnorphology forrnations in the simulation cases studies in this work, are anisotropic in nature, which is clue to the fact that the phase separation is induced by non-uniform (under spatial linear temperature gradient) quenching of the polymer solution. The shnulation results describing the fonnation of droplet-type rnorphology at intervals AB (Figure 5.2) and EF (Figure 5.:3) (off-critical non-uniforn1 quench cases) and the formation of the interconnected-type structures at interval CD (Figure 5.4) {critical non-uniform quench case) are consistent with the experi1nental results presented by Kyu et al [89] and Tanaka et al [90). In addition~ these results are also in good agreernent with the nu1nerical results presented by Copetti and Elliott [91], Chakrabarti [92], Brown and Chakrabarti (93), Chan and Rey [28, 33], and Jiang and Chan [1 9). l\:Ioreover, analyzing the spatial concentration profiles and patterns in Figures .5.2 , 5.:3 and .5.4, it is interesting to note that the initiation of the phase separation phenornena begins at the low ternperature region of the polyrner solution sample at early times, and the phase separated regions grow over tin1e increasingly from the region,
~r:*

= 0 to :r* =

1 to occupy the entire solution sarnple area. This kind of n1orphological

developrnent is due to the externally imposed spatial linear ten1perature gradient across the polyrner solution smnple, which induces the effect of differential quench along the :c* direction. At low ternperature region, i.e. close to x *

= 0, srnall droplets are fonned

initially at early stage clue to the deep quench effect and become larger at later tirnes clue to coarsening in the late stage, whereas at the high ternperature region, i.e. close to :r* = 1, fairly large droplets are formed initially at early stage due to the shallow quench effect, 73

and that is why the resultant pattern or n1orphology forrnation is of anisotropic in nature. And also, since the droplets are fonned at different tirnes due to the difference in quench depth across the polyrner solution sarnple in x* -direction, the droplets will undergo the
thre(~

stages (i.e. the early stage, the intermediate stage and the late stage, refer to Figure

1.4) of SD at different tirnes [22]. But, after certain period of time of phase separation, the droplets size in both low and high ternperature regions becornes apparently uniforn1, as it is evident frmn Figures 5.2 and 5.4. These anisotropic rnorphological results are in good agreement with the experimental results presented by lVIatsuyama et al [16 , 56] and numerical results presented by Lee et al [22]. Other important phenmnenon, which could be contributing to the above n1entioned n1orphological developrnent, is the thennal diffusion phenon1enon or Ludwig-Soret effect. As discussed earlier, a spatial ten1perature gradient applied to a fluid mixture generally induces net rnass flows across the n1ixture, which leads to the fonnation of concentration gradients at rnicroscopic level in the mixture. This cross effect between ternperature and concentration gradient is known as Ludwig-Soret effect or thermal diffusion phenon1enon. These rnicroscopically induced concentration gradients also increase the total free energy of the solution sufficiently to enhance the phase separation process in a polyrner solution by the spinodal decornposition (SD) rnechanism, as the initial conditions of the solutions are rnaintained such that the quench interval of the solution always lies in the spinodal region of the phase diagram (see Figure 5.1 and Table 5.1).

Apparently, it is very difficult to visualize the effect of the thennal-diffusion on the overall phase separation mechanism in a polyrner solution, as there are no visual differences in the pattern or rnorphological development with or without consideration of the thermaldiffusion phenmnenon at microscopic level. Therefore, in order to identify the effect of the thennal diffusion phenomenon on the overall phase separation rnechanism (TIPS via SD) in a polyrner solution n1icroscopically, the tirne evolution of the dirnensionless struc-

74

ture factor and the dimensionless transition tilne can be utilized, which will help us better understand the characteristics of the phase separation mechanisn1 in a polyn1er solution.

5.2

Time Evolution of Dimensionless Structure Factor

The dirnensionless structure factor is an in1portant parmneter used to characterize the developn1ent of phase separated don1ains by the SD n1echanisrn in polymer solutions or blends, and it helps relate the nurnerical results and experirnental studies perfonned on the phase separation rnechanisn1 in poly1ner solutions. Therefore, the tin1e evolution of the twophase structures, such as ones produced during the phase separation process in the polymer systems studied in this work, can also be quantified using the dirnensionless structure factor , S*(k*, t*). Before, we jump onto the dirnensionless structure factor calculation, it is very important to understand the relationship between the dirnensionless structure factor,

S*(k*, t*) and the scattered light intensity, I 8 in the s1nall angle light scattering (SALS)
experinwnts, which are carried out to study the extent of phase separation in polyrner solutions or blends. lVIatherna.tically, the relationship between the scattered light intensity,

Is in srnall angle light scattering (SALS) experirnents and the dimensionless structure
factor , S* (k*, t*) in the numerical study for the phase separation meehanisrn in polymer solutions or blends is of following forrn [91 , 94] .

\Nhere, Is is the scattered light intensity, q is the scattering wave vector or wave nurnber ,

and A* (k* , t*) is the magnitude of the Fourier transfonn of the concentration fluctuations in the system. Thus, experiinental light scattering data is directly proportional to the diInensionless structure factor and a detailed discussion of the development of this expression

75

(Equation (5.1)) can be found elsewhere [94]. The following sumrnarizes the characteristics of the early stage to the intennecliate stage of phase separation by the SD rnechanisrn in relation to the light scattering data obtained from the SALS experirnents [7]. Early Stage: According to the linear Cahn theory [78] in the early stage of SD, Is can be related with tirne t as:

I 8 (q, t) ex I 8 (q, t

= 0) exp [2R(q)t]

(5.2)

where, R( q) is a growth rate of the concentration fluctuation. \Nave nurnber, q is given by following expression:

Here, n is the solution refractive index, and .\ 0 is the wavelength of light in vacuo.

R(q) can be correlated to q as:

(5.4)

where,

Dapp

is the apparent diffusion coefficient, and qm is the wave nurnber of

rnaxirnum scattered light intensity. Equation (5.2) in1plies that the scattered light intensity, Is grows exponentially during the early stage of the phase separation by the SD mechanisrn and the growth rate of the concentration fluctuation, R(q) is weakly non-linear as can be observed from Equation (5.4). Therefore, a plot of natural log of the scattered light intensity given by Equation (5.2) should produce a straight line for the early stage of phase separation by the SD nrechanism. Inter1nediate Stage: During the intermediate stage of the phase separation by the SD nrechanism , the scattered light intensity continues to increase, but at a slower rate
76

than in the early stage of phase separation by the SD rnecha.nisn1. And also, in the intennediate stage, the wave nurnber q decreases and the wavelength .X increases, which is due the fact that q ex

A typical plot of the scattered light intensityj Is versus the wave number, q in the early to the beginning of the intennediate stages for phase separation by the SD rnechanisn1 is shown in Figure 5.5.

Figure 5.5: Typical light scattering profiles showing the time evolution of phase separation by the SD mechanism in the early stage to the beginning of the intern1ediate stage in the small angle light scattering (SALS) experilnent. Each profile represents scattered light intensity at certain tirne, t. The scattered light intensity, 18 is increasing with tirne, while the wave nun1ber, q remains constant, which is typical characteristic of the early stage of SD [7].

Thus, in sumn1a.ry, the dirnensionless structure factor, S*(k*, t*) and the dirnensionless wave (position) vector, k* closely resmnble the scattered light intensity, 18 (q, t) and wave nurnber,

structure factor , S*(k*, t*) is calculated sirnply by taking the squares of the magnitude of the Fourier transforrn, A* (k*, t*) of the concentration fluctuations in the systern. Therefore, from Equation (5.1), the dilnensionless structure factor can be expressed as:

In order to calculate the din1ensionless structure factor , 8* (k*, t*), a sn1all computer prograrn written in NIATLAB R2007a was used to detennine the Fast Fourier Transforn1 (FFT), A * (k*, t*) of the simulation results (sarnple data) at a specific tin1e, t* and then taking the square of this FFT results yields the dirnensionless structure factor. Table 5.2 lists the dirnensionless parameters used in four simulation ca'3es considered for the investigation of the effect thermal diffusion phenon1enon during the phase separation rnechanisn1 in binary polyrner solutions under an externally in1posed spatial linear ten1perature gradient.

intennecliate stage. It is also interesting to note that the wave vector remains constant in all the four cases shown during the phase separation process in the early to the beginning of the intern1ediate stages, which is quite normal trend during the early stage of the phase separation mechanisrn [7] and is consistence with the results reported in the experirnental [62, 63] as well as numerical [34] works. It can also be noted that as n1agnitude of the dirnensionless therrnal diffusion coefficient increases, the tin1e to reach the maximum structure factor S*(k;n, t*) decreases, i.e the phase separation rnechanis1n proceeds at a faster rate. Thus, it can be concluded from these findings that the thermal diffusion phenomenon does have some sort of the i1npact on the extent of phase separation mechanism as it speeds up the overall phase separation process at 1nicroscopic level, but not significantly.

81

5~3

The Transition Time fron1 the Early Stage to the Intermediate Stage

Another important characteristic paran1eter, called the dinwnsionless transition time,

t; ,

can also be used to characterize the extent of polymer phase separation process by the SD rnechanism. It will also help us analyze the effect of the dirnensionless thennal diffusion coefficient, D'* on the overall process of polyrner phase separation (i.e. TIPS) by the SD mechanism. As discussed in Chapter 1, the overall phase separation process by the SD rnechanisrn is cornprised of three stages: the early stage, the interrnediate stage, and the late stage. The transition tin1e basically represents the din1ensionless time of transition between the early stage and the intennediate stage of the phase separation process by SD.

Figure 5.10 shows a plot of the natural log of the dimensionless ma.ximurn structure factor, S*(k~ 7, , t*) versus the dirnensionless tirne, t* for a non-uniform quench case of polyrner phase separation n1echanisrn (TIPS via SD) in polymer solutions. This curve is typical of the spinodal decomposition (SD) rnechanisn1, since there is an exponential growth initially at early stage, and then it slows down when it enters the intern1ediate stage of the phase separation mechanisnL The intersection of the tvvo straight lines drawn on each side of the curve represents the transition point between the early and the intennediate stages of the SD rnechanisn1 and the dimensionless time indicated by the downward arrow gives the

t; (refer to Figure 5.10). Table 5.3 lists the calculated values of the dilnensionless transition tirne, t; corresponding to the sirnulation cases listed in Tadirnensionless transition time, ble 5.2 with respect to the different thern1al diffusion coefficients. It can be observed from these results that as the value of the dimensionless therrnal diffusion coefficient increases, the value of dirnensionless transition time decreases very little in magnitude comparatively, which is again indicative of the fact that the thennal diffusion phenon1enon or the LudwigSoret effect does have sorne influence on the phase separation n1echanisrn (TIPS via SD)

82

in polyrner solutions, as the phase separation process proceeds at relatively faster rate in presence of the thern1al diffusion phenomenon in polymer solutions under an externally irnposed spatial linear ten1perature gradient.

This curve is typical of the spinodal decon1position (SD) nwchanisrn, since there is an exponential growth initially at early stage, and then it slows down when it enters the intern1ediate stage of the phase separation mechanisrn.

In sumrnary, the pattern or rnorphology forrnation during the polynwr phase separation mechanism (TIPS via SD) in polyrner solutions involving the therrnal diffusion phenornenon under an externally irnposed spatial linear temperature gradient is of droplet-type in cases of non-uniforrn off-critical quench , i.e. (c0 <

to note that both the rnorphologies, the droplet-type as well as the interconnected-type structures are of anisotropic in nature as the phase separation is induced by non-uniforn1 (under tern perature gradient) quenching of the polymer solution. These results are consistent with the experimental as well as the numerical results reported in the literature (refer to Section 5.1). As far as the effect of thern1al diffusion on the pattern or rnorphology forrnation concerned, there are no visual rnorphological differences ·during the phase separation rnechanisrn with or without the consideration of the thennal diffusion phenomenon. On the other hand, at n1icroscopic leveL the thennal diffusion phenornenon or the LudwigSoret effect has very little or negligible effect on the phase separation rnechanisn1 (TIPS via SD) in polymer solutions under non-uniform tern perature field in the early to the intermediate stages of the SD as expected, which is evident frmn the studies of the time evolution of the dirnensionless structure factor (refer to Section 5.2) and the dimensionless transition tilne (refer to Section 5.3).

CHAPTER 6 CONCLUSIONS
Thermal-induced phase separation (TIPS) nwthod is one the n1ost widely used rnethods for the rnanufacturing of the functional polymeric rnaterials, i.e. PDLC fihns for electrooptical devices, rnicroporous synthetic rnen1branes, etc. Also, the induced temperature gradient for producing the structural anisotropy in the polymer filn1s. A rigorous rnathematical n1odel, representing the phase separation mechanisrn, i.e. TIPS via the spinodal decomposition (SD) mechanisrn, and also involving the thennal diffusion phenomenon in binary polyrner solutions under an externally irnposed spatial linear ternperature gradient, was developed and solved successfully. The rnathematical rnodel is composed of the nonlinear Cahn-Hilliard theory describing the dynarnic behavior of the spinodal decornposition (SD) mechanisrn, the Flory-Huggins (F-H) theory describing thennodynan1ics of polyrner solutions, the slow n1ode theory and Rouse law for diffusion phenornena in polymer solutions, and the theory of Ludwig-Soret effect describing the thennal diffusion phenornenon in polyn1er solutions under the influence of an externally imposed spatial ternperature gradient. The mathernatical model wac; solved using the rnunerical methods of Galerkin finite elen1ents with Hermitian bicubic interpolants and finite differences, respectively for spatial and ten1pora.l discretizations. The first-order in1plicit Euler predictor-corrector method was used for time integration; and the tirne steps were controlled using an adaptive time-step control n1echanisn1 on the local truncation error and tolerance in such a rnanner that a given accuracy was always n1aintained.

85

The rnathematical n1odel was successfully irnplemented to study the Lud\vig-Soret effect in the phase separation rnechanisn1 (TIPS via SD) involving the therrnal diffusion phenomenon in binary polymer solutions under an externally irnposed spatial linear temperature gradient in one-din1ension as well in two-dirnensions, although only two-din1ensiona.l simulation results have been presented and discussed in this work. In order to investigate the effect of therrnal diffusion phenmnenon on the phase separation rnechanisrn (TIPS via SD), two kinds of the quench rnethods (i.e. uniform and non-unifonn) to induce the phase separation in single phase hon1ogeneous polyrner solutions , were studied for cornparison. For uniforrn quench, a single phase hon1ogeneous polymer solution is quenched to a temperature, which is uniform everywhere in the solution, i.e. no ternperature gradients. vVhereas, for non-uniforn1 quench, polyn1er solution is quenched in such a way that a spatial terrlperature gradient is formed in the solution. The sirnulation results represented by the pattern or morphology formation during the phase separation process of TIPS via SD in a binary polymer solution involving the thern1al diffusion phenornenon under an externally imposed spatial linear ternperature gradient indicated that non-uniform off-critical quenching of the polyrner solution produced the droplet-type morphology, whereas a non-uniform critical quenching of the polymer solution produced the transient interconnected-type structures, which are of anisotropic in nature. These simulation results describing the formation of the droplet-type n1orphologies (off-critical quench) and the interconnected-type structures (critical quench) were consistent with the ones reported in the literature. And also, the externally irnposed spatial linear temperature gradient contributed to the formation of the anisotropic n1orphological structures, which were also found to be consistent with the experirr1ental as well as nurnerical results presented in the literature. As far as the effect of thermal diffusion phenmnenon on the phase separation rnechanisrr1 (TIPS via SD) was concerned, it was very difficult to identify the effect of thennal diffusion on the pattern forrnation during the phase separation process, as there were no visual differences in the patterns fonnation with or without the consideration of therrnal diffusion phenon1enon.

86

Therefore, in order to investigate the influence of the thermal diffusion phenomenon on the phase separation mechanism in polymer solutions at n1icroscopic level, the time evolution of the dirnensionless structure factor and the transition time were analyzed. The dimensionless structure factor was calculated by taking the squares of the magnitude of the Fourier Transfonn of the concentration fluctuations in the polyrner solution. For that a small computer progra.rn written in rviATLAB R2007a was used to calculate the Fast Fourier Transfonn (FFT) of the simulation results (sample data) at specific time, and the squares of these FFT results yielded the dimensionless structure factor. It was evident from the tin1e evolution of the dimensionless structure factor and the transition tirne that the thennal diffusion phenomena actually had very little or negligible influence on the phase separation rnechaniSin (TIPS via SD) during the early to the intermediate stages of SD, although it assisted the phase separation rnechanisn1 at microscopic level in polymer solution by speeding up the process smnewhat.

This chapter provides recornrnendations for future work, which could be carried out based on this sirnulation study. This study, for investigation of the effect of thermal diffusion phenomenon or the Ludwig-Soret effect in the phase separation nwchanisrn (TIPS via SD) in polyn1er solutions under non-uniform ten1perature field, was carried out using computational technique. The governing mathen1atical rnodel was solved using nun1erical n1ethods of Galerkin finite element and finite differences, respectively for space and temporal discretizations, also ernploying Ne-vvton-Raphson iterative n1echanisrn. The cmnputational tirne taken by each sin1ulation was from 20 hrs to 28 hrs (average). One of the reconlmendation for future work would be to try to solve the mathematical n1odel using acmnmercial software such as COI\!ISOL nmltiphysics, which might help reduce the cmnputational tirrw significantly, and at the sa1ne tin1e smaller mesh sizes could also be employed with it.

Another recomrnendation would be to try and solve the mathematical rnodel using the deeper quenching of the polymer solutions in the unstable region of the pha-,e diagrmn , and also using the larger temperature gradient across the polymer solution sarnple for more analysis.
