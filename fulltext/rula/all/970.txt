ABSTRACT
The Fey receptor is a cell surface protein essential in the immune response that binds IgG-opsonized particles resulting in phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is a process used to remove pathogens and confine them in a vacuole that will enable their breakdown. The members of the Ras superfamily of small G proteins have been identified in samples where the activated Fey receptor complex was captured and analyzed using tandem mass spectrometry. The protein Rap, belonging to the Ras superfamily, guanosine triphosphatases (GTPase) activating proteins (GAPs), which promote the dissociation of GTP, and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), that permits the exchange of GDP for GTP, were detected by SEQUEST in RAW 264.7 macrophages and further analyzed using various methods. In this study, Raps, RasGAPs, and RapGEFs, were observed by tandem mass spectrometry and sequence correlation analysis. The selected isoforms were confirmed by Western blots, live cell confocal microscopy with fluorescent fusion constructs and antibody staining to verify the localization of Ras proteins, specifically Rapl, p120RasGAP and C3G, a RapGEF, to the activated Fe reeceptor.

INTRODUCTION
Cell surface proteins such as the receptor complexes are recognized as potential targets for many immune system associated diseases (Davis, 2007). As members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (Fridman, 1991), Fey receptors have shown great potential as immunotherapy targets because of their ability to regulate the immune response through the interaction with IgG antibodies enabling the stimulation of pro or anti-inflammatory responses (Nimmerjahn, et al. , 2008). These membrane proteins play a vital role in the regulation of the immune response in mammalian cells via complex cascades of signaling networks. The identification of these signaling proteins and the roles that they play specifically in the uptake of foreign matter has been studied extensively but not all signaling molecules and their functions have been identified (Greenberg, et al., 2002). Further investigation of the pathway proteins may provide great insight towards understanding the immune response and the activating and inactivating molecules that may have potential as therapeutic targets in the treatment of many human associated diseases. White blood cells such as neutrophils and macrophages are capable of removing pathogens and confining them in a vacuole that will enable their breakdown. This process is known as phagocytosis. Macrophages provide a working model of the phagocytic pathway due to their ability to engulf IgG-opsonized particles such as latex beads. This model provides insight about the proteins and their functions within the Fey receptor complex as well as the cellular process that are involved in immunity and the signaling events that trigger the inflammation response (Greenberg et al., 2002). This study will investigate selected members of the Ras superfamily and their associated regulatory proteins in RAW 264.7 macrophages at the site of the activated Fey receptor complex.

Immune Response
The antigen nonspecific innate immune system and the antigen specific adaptive immune system are the two related components of the vertebrate immune system that function to protect against invading organisms (Hoffmann, et al., 1999). The adaptive immune system is comprised of memory cells such as the autoreactive T lymphocytes and autoantibody producing B lymphocytes among others, which possess a variety of cell surface receptors that enable recognition of pathogens. The engagement of these adaptive receptors requires the recognition of a specific antigen belonging to a pathogen that has previously infected the body, thus resulting in a highly specific and amplified response (Medzhitov, et al., 1997). In the absence of prior exposure to a pathogen the adaptive response may take days or weeks to trigger an immune response, thus putting the victim at high risk of harm or even death. In contrast, the innate immune system corresponds to the immune response that does not require previous exposure to a pathogen in order to elicit an antimicrobial effect and it is the primary line of defense against microbial infections (Greenberg et al., 2002). The innate immune system is composed of anatomical barriers, the complement system, secreted antimicrobial peptides and particularly phagocytosis and its ancillary reactions. Phagocytosis by macrophages initiates the innate immune system via the activation of specific phagocytic receptors that aid in the discrimination between pathogens and self. These receptors engage in a specific recognition mechanism that enables identification of conserved motifs on pathogens that are not found in higher eukaryotes (Aderem, et al., 1999). Cellular receptors that are involved in the recognition mechanism are mannose receptors, that recognize pathogen associated residues such as mannas and integrins, as well as scavenger receptors that recognize modified lipoproteins including low density lipoprotein (LDL), resulting in the formation of foam cells that have been identified in

2

atherosclerotic plaques (Brown, et al., 1983). Toll-like receptors (TLR) interact with pathogenassociated molecular patterns leading to inflammatory responses as well as development of antigen-specific adaptive immunity (Takeda, et al., 2003). The production of specific antibodies by the adaptive immune system or the naive antibody repertoire, provide high affinity IgG that permit efficient interaction with the family of Fey receptors. Thus antibodies that recognize epitopes on infectious agents represent the intersection between the adaptive immune system and the innate immune system via the Fe receptor pathway that is stimulated by their Fe domains (Aderem et al., 1999).

that not all but some genes and functions are conserved between species (Nimmerjahn, et al., 2006). Although differences between human and mouse Fey receptors are evident, the mouse provides a valuable model of the mechanisms involved in Fey receptor signaling, which has been confirmed in human models (Davis, 2007; Nimmerjahn, et al., 2005; Revetch, 2003). The complexity of the Fey receptor family can be better illustrated by their interaction with the antibody Fe fragment and number of different IgG subclasses that can bind the receptor with different affinities and vary between species. In humans, for instance there are four different subclasses of IgG, namely IgG 1-IgG4. In mice there are also four, IgG 1, IgG 2a, IgG 2b and IgG3, that vary by their affinity and specificity to different Fey receptors (Dijstelbloem, et al.,

Fe receptors The family of Fe receptors for IgG or Fey receptors, simultaneously trigger various activating and inhibitory signaling pathways that generate an immune response, as well as function in the process of antigen presentation, regulation of B-cell activation, plasma-cell survival and immune-complex-mediated maturation of dendritic cells (Bolland, et al., 1999). Fey receptors fall into approximately three categories divided according to their affinity for IgG, the structure of the Fe fragment and the activating or inhibitory signaling pathway they induce through direct association with their immunoreceptor tyrosine based activating motifs (IT AM) and immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibitory motifs (ITIM) localized on the cytosolic a-chain (Fig. 1). In order of highest to lowest affinity for IgG they are: FcyR1 cluster of differentiation (CD) 64, FcyRIIA/B/C (CD32), and FcyRIIIA/B (CD16). The FcyR1 is the high-affinity receptor in both mouse and human, and all other receptors retain medium to low affinity for the Fe fragment of IgG. These classes of receptors have been recognized in mice and homologous genes for the family of Fey receptors have also been identified in humans and monkeys, thus implying

2001; Nimmerjahn et al., 2005). Antibodies mediate effector functions and cellular immune responses by interacting with Fey receptors and stimulating pro and anti-inflammatory functions. The activation of cell surface receptors via antibodies varies extremely and has engaged much interest in the field of immunotherapy. For instance, enhancing or blocking antibody binding has been known to regulate the immune response and improve the therapeutic outcome in many human diseases (Nimmerjahn et al., 2008).

resulting phagolysosome is targeted to the phagocyte oxidase complex. The second function is to utilize phagocytosis to direct antigens to peptide presenting molecules such as MHC I and II compartments (Greenberg et al., 2002). It is these two functions that allow phagocytosis to serve a dual role in the innate immune response, as well as link the innate and acquired immune responses.

importance for the initiation and generation of acquired immunity. MHC class II molecules take time in their transport to the cell surface from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), that sorts and delivers proteins to various cell destinations, in order to intersect with the endocytic pathway (Traub, et al., 1997). In professional antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages, the late

endosomes and lysosomes become enriched in the MHC class II molecules and these specialized endo/lysosomes become known as the MHC class II compartments (MIICs). It is thought that antigen presentation is a result of the fission and fusion events involved in the maturation of the phagosome and that a portion of the phagosome containing a partially degraded antigen undergoes fission and fuses with a MIIC (Vieira, et al., 2002).

Phagocytosis Phagocytosis is the process by which for~ign particles and apoptotic bodies are eliminated and it is a dynamic component of the innate immune system. Phagocytic leukocytes such as neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages are essential players in the immune system since they destroy invading pathogens (Rabinovitch, 1995). A remarkably complex, and biologically important phagocytic signaling pathway triggers the encapsulation of foreign particles and microbial pathogens by phagocytosis. Phagocytic leukocytes have two essential functions in the immune system, the first of which is in the microbial death pathway whereby the ingested particle is directed to the lysosomes and treated with hydrolytic enzymes, and the

Phagocytosis is triggered by a complex network of signaling proteins, which is mediated by the activation of ce~l surface receptors. Many different cell surface phagocytosis promoting receptors that mediate innate immune responses in mammalian cells have been described (Greenberg et al., 2002). The cell surface receptors of the innate immune system must discriminate between various pathogens and its own cellular components. Cell surface receptors fall into two categories; those that bind pathogens or particles coated with a host-derived ligand, termed opsonic receptors, and those that bind ligands endogenous to the pathogen or external particle, termed non-opsonic receptors (Aderem et al., 1999). Opsonic receptors are those that recognize particles coated with antibodies by the host complement system and are recognized by

the Fe receptors respectively (Underhill, et al., 2002). The roles of the diverse cell surface receptors in phagocytosis are specific in signaling actin polymerization and particle internalization (Aderem et al., 1999). The functions of the innate immune system resulting from phagocytosis are mediated by the interaction of cell surface receptors with their cognate ligands. The response of phagocytes, such as macrophages to engulf particles, is triggered and regulated by multi-ligand receptors on the cell surface including the Ig superfamily members such as the Fe receptors. The family of Fe gamma receptors for IgG not only stimulate the innate response but also determine whether an immunogenic or tolerogenic response is initiated upon ligand recognition, therefore making them attractive targets for novel immunotherapy practices (Nimmerjahn et al., 2008). Immunogenic reactions are those that efficiently mediate pro-inflammatory responses and lead to the removal of infected cells, whereas tolerogenic responses do not initiate the immune response and suppress inflammatory responses. The many ligands that are recognized as pathogens or foreign by the innate immune receptors and stimulate the activation of phagocytes via the Fe receptor include hydrophobic surfaces such as polystyrene particles, IgG, ox-LDL, C-reactive protein, other modified lipids and apoptotic cells (Febbraio, et al., 2001). The activation of the Fe receptor by binding IgG-opsonized particles is a well studied process, however the events that proceed the triggering of the complex cascade of protein activation and inactivation processes are much less understood and not all the proteins involved in the Fe receptor pathway have been identified. Studies involved in the identification of specific proteins and their roles in the uptake of pathogens via the Fe receptor complex pathway may provide potential targets in the treatment of disease (Davis, 2007).

Many signaling pathways in cellular processes converge on and regulate phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), whose inositol lipid products are key mediators in trafficking of membranes along the endocytic pathway and are critical for phagosome maturation (Vieira et
al., 2002). The family of PI3Ks phosphorylate the free OH groups of the inositol ring producing

phosphoinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P3]. The activated PI3K converts the plasma membrane lipid phosphinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] into PI(3,4,5)P3. Three classes of PI3Ks have been derived which are based on their regulation and substrate preference. Class I PI3K is activated by a cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), or G-protein-coupled receptors to generate PIP3. Once activated by their receptors, class I PI3K phosphorylates plasma membrane phosphoinositides that bind with and then activate serine-threonine kinase Akt (Baumgartner, et al., 2000; Domin, et al., 1997; Jones,
et al., 2005; Riley, et al., 2006). Akt are protein kinases that regulate cell survival, metabolism,

angiogenesis as well as various human diseases when deregulated (Manning, et al., 2007). The class II PI3K is a p 170 molecule and these proteins are found predominantly in the membrane of cells and are activated by insulin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), or platelet-derived growth factor. Class II enzymes as of yet, have not been identified in phagosome maturation or formation (Vieira et al., 2002). Class III PI3Ks however play a key role in intracellular trafficking through the synthesis of PI(3)P and PIP2 (Knight, et al., 2006). These classes of PI3Ks have very significant and different mechanisms in endocytic trafficking. For instance, the activation of class I PI3K results in the inhibition of degredative processes of endocytosis, while class III PI3K is required for the formation of vesicles and their subsequent transport to the lysosomes (Deretic, 2006; Vieira et al., 2002). Thus, class I and class III PI3Ks are important regulatory molecules in phagocyte maturation (Vieira et al., 2002).

The elimination of invading microorganisms and other foreign particles by macrophages and neutrophils can be distributed among three different stages relevant to the molecules that are active at each stage. The three stages of phagocytosis consist of the early phagosome, the late phagosome and the phagolysosome. Initially the internalization of a foreign particle into the plasma membrane derived vacuole, known as the phagosome, is not competent to kill and eliminate the ingested microorganism. This is because the phagosome is similar to the lipid bilayer plasmalemma and its contents resemble the extracellular milieu, thus only enabling internalization but not digestion (Scott, et al., 2003; Vieira et al., 2002). Following sealing, the phagosome undergoes a sophisticated series of rapid fission and fusion events that result in the modification and formation of vesicles and tubules, their limiting membrane and their contents. This process is know as phagosome maturation and bestows the vacuole with a host of degredative properties, which are central to its microbial function (Beron, et al., 1995; Tjelle, et
al., 2000). Phagosome muturation is dependant on a remodeling sequence that resembles the

sequential acquisition of fusion determinants during phagosome maturation, there is an overall agreement that it is the orderly interaction with elements of the endocytic pathway that grants lytic ability to the phagosome. Phagosome maturation and the endocytic pathway are interrelated. The maturation process that provides the phagosome with lytic activity depends critically on the interaction of the nascent vacuole with the endocytic pathway (Vieira et al., 2002). The endocytic pathway is an organized continuum of organelles ranging from early endosomes to lysosomes. In endocytosis, after internalization of a receptor-ligand complex, the contents of an endocytic vesicle are targeted to a sorting endosome, also know as an early endosome. Sorting endosomes are responsible for organizing and re-routing the assortment of internalized molecules. The ligand and its receptor dissociate and the receptor is returned back to the cell periphery in recycling endosomes, while the ligand continues along the degredative stages of the endocytic pathway towards lysosomes. Sorting or early endosomes are recognized by the presence of Rab5 or early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1), or experimentally by applying short pulses of ligands or fluid-phase markers.

progression of the endocytic pathway, whereby phagosomes fuse extensively with sorting and late endosomes and lysosomes, and are ultimately converted from plasmalemma-like organelles to a lysosome like hybrid organelle, the phagolysosome (Beron et al., 1995; Pitt, et al., 1992).

The early phagosome This process is thought to involve various fusion events with components of the endocytic pathway, as well as the removal of components by vesicular fission. These sequential interactions have been termed the "kiss and run" hypothesis (Desjardins, 1995) and bring about tremendous changes to the phagosmal contents and membrane. It has been proposed that through this mechanism, endosomes or lysosomes and phagosomes all form transient hybrid organelles connected by fusion pores that allow selective exchange of some membrane and luminal components to occur, followed by fission. Regardless of the detailed mechanism involved in the Rab5, a member of the superfamily of small G-proteins is thought to control the earliest identified stages of phagosomal maturation (Duclos, et al., 2000; Roberts, et al., 2000). The recruitment of Rab5 to the endosomal membrane has been suggested to be modulated by Ras, through the mediation of guanine nucleotide exchange factor RIN1 (Barbieri, et al., 1998; Hoffenberg, et al., 2000; Li, et al., 1997). When in its GTP bound form, Rab5 can interact with several effectors, such as Rabenosyn-5, Rabaptin-5, and Rabex-5. Rabaptin-5 is a cytosolic

10

protein that is recruited to endosomes by Rab5-GTP and inhibits GTP hydrolysis, and Rabex-5 is a 60 kDa cytosolic nucleotide exchange factor specific for Rab5 that exists in association with Rabaptin-5 (Hoffenberg et al., 2000; Horiuchi, et al., 1997; Lippe, et al., 2001). A novel Rab5 effector, Rab5 FYVE-finger effector, Rabankyrin-5, was recently discovered to localize to the early endosomes and shown to stimulate fusion activity (Schnatwinkel, et al., 2004). Like other small GTPases, Rab5-GTP is capable of recruiting downstream effectors. One such effector is EEA1, which at each terminus contains a spatially separate Rab-5-binding domain, thereby allowing it to serve as a bridge between two early endosomes (Mu, et al., 1995). EEA1 also contains a FYVE zinc finger domain that interacts with PI(3)P and is required for the endosomal targeting of EEA1 (Lawe, et al., 2000; Patki, et al., 1997; Stenmark, et al., 1996). Membranes containing Rab5 and PI(3)P are permitted to be tethered or bridged to the membrane due to the formation of antiparallel dimers by EEA1(Callaghan, et al., 1999). Another critical Rab5 effector is vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 34 (hVPS34), a type III PI3K. Class I, II and III PI3K are all capable of PI(3)P synthesis in vitro and regulate endocytic traffic, however, it is the Class III kinase that is the biologically relevant source of PI(3)P and is the PI3K that participates in phagosome maturation (Leevers, et al., 1999; Vanhaesebroeck, et al., 1997). VPS34 exists in a complex associated with p150, a VPS15like serine/threonine kinase subunit of the complex, which is thought to regulate the membrane association and activity of VPS34 (Murray, et al., 2000; Murray, et al., 2002). Besides EEA1, Rab5 also recruits the p150/VPS34 complex to generate PI(3)P, a lipid that is crucial in the subsequent maturation process. Nascent phagosomes acquire PI(3)P shortly after sealing and it localizes to the membrane of the phagosomes within 1-2 minutes into the sealing process and persists for approximately 10 minutes, disappearing subsequently. Downstream effectors of

PI(3)P contain specific binding domains for the lipid, such as the PX domain in the p40 subunit of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex or the FYVE domain found in EEA1 (Ellson, et al., 2002; Gaullier, et al., 1998; Patki, et al., 1998). NADPH oxidase complex is a membrane-bound enzyme consisting of multiple subunits that generate highly-reactive superoxides in the phagosome by transferring electrons from NADPH across the membrane. Binding to PI(3)P through its FYVE domain is required for the interaction of EEA1 with the docking and fusion machinery of the endosomal membrane (Wurmser, et al., 1999). While the fusion events that characterize phagosome maturation are important, remodeling of the phagosome also requires a loss of membrane and luminal components through budding, or fission, of vesicles. This process is imperative for ensuring that the mature phagosome maintains a constant surface area despite ongoing fusion events. In the endocytic pathway, internalized cell surface receptors that are destined for degradation are targeted to the inner vesicles of a subset of late endosomes, while receptors that are destined to be recycled back to the plasma membrane remain on the endosomallimiting membrane. Specialized endosomes, termed multivesicular bodies, allow the cell to physically separate proteins intended for lysosomal destruction from those that are to be conserved by the cell. The transition of the sorting endosome or early phagosome to the late endosome/phagosome is indicated by the absence of Rab5, EEA 1, and Pl(3 )P from the phagosomal membrane, followed by the acquisition of Rab7, Rab9 and other molecular markers (Vieira et al., 2002). The equilibrium between the active membrane bound Rab5-GTP and the inactive cytoplasmic Rab5-GDP may be regulated by GAPs. GAPs control the lifetime of the activated state of Rab proteins and are thought to promote Rab GTPase hydrolysis by properly aligning a catalytically important glutamine residue and inserting a so-called arginine finger

11

residue directly into the Rab active site to stabilize the transition site of the hydrolysis reaction (Pfeffer, 2005). Possible GAPs for Rab5 include p120RasGAP, the tumor suppressor tuberin which is a product of the TSC2 complex, and RN-tre (Haas, et al., 2005; Lanzetti, et al., 2000; Liu, et al., 1998). Another GAP for Rab5 includes RabGAP-5. The over expression of this GAP results in a loss of EEAI from endosomes and blocks endocytic trafficking, while the depletion of this GAP results in increased endosome size, more endosome associated EEAI, and disrupts the trafficking of lysosomal-associated membrane proteins (LAMPs), specifically LAMP-l (Haas et al., 2005; Pfeffer, 2005). Regulation of Rab5 by RabGAP-5 limits the amount of activated Rab5 and regulates trafficking through endosomes.

into the mechanism of cargo progression between the early and late endosomes (Rink, et al., 2005). This process occurs via a bulk change of a Rab5 organelle into a Rab7 late endosome. The loss of Rab5 and acquisition of Rab7 requires the class C vacuole protein sorting/homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (VPS/HOPS) complex, which is a know Rab7 GEF and interacts with Rab5. Rab5 mutants defective in GTP hydrolysis result in endosomes that recruit Rab7 but fail to displace Rab5, since GTP hydrolysis is prevented. Therefore, it is likely that following class C VPS/HOPS-dependant recruitment of Rab7 onto Rab5-positive endosomes, the completion of conversion involves nagative feedback between Rab7 and Rab5 domains, possibly through the action of a Rab5-GAP (Rink et al., 2005). There are three effectors for Rab7: the Rab7-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP), oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)-related protein-1L

The late phagosome
The late endosome/phagosome is characterized by an increase in acidity and the presence

(ORP1L), and Rabring 7 (Cantalupo, et al., 2001; Johansson, et al., 2005; Jordens, et al., 2001; Mizuno, et al., 2003). Rabring7 functions in late endocytic trafficking and lysosome biogenesis downstream of Rab7. It has also been discovered that Rabring7 is a Rab7 target protein on the

of Rab7, Rab9, mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR), syntaxin 7, LAMPs and lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA), which appear between 15 and 45 minutes after phagosome sealing (Vieira et al., 2002). The increase in acidity of the late endosome causes the release of lysosomal enzymes from the M6PR, thus permitting the recycling of the receptor to the TGN (Nishi, et al., 2002). In studies where the pH of the phagosome was artificially increased it was observed that phagosome maturation was arrested and Rab5 remained on the phagosome in its GTP-bound form (Huynh, et al., 2007). The mechanism of this effect is still unknown, but it can

basis that it binds the GTP-bound form of Rab7 and is recruited by the GTP-bound form of Rab7 onto late endosomes/lysosomes (Mizuno et al., 2003). ORPIL also localizes to the late endosome/lysosome and interacts physically with GTP-bound form of Rab7 (Johansson et al., 2005). Likewise, GTP-bound Rab7 recruits RILP, and in tum RILP is capable of simultaneously binding microtubule motor dynein/dynactin on Rab7-positive organelles. These motors are responsible for the transport of Rab7 -positive organelles toward the minus end of microtubules so they may be removed from the cell periphery and directed towards the perinuclear region (Colucci, et al., 2005; Jordens et al., 2001). Another small G-protein that localizes to the late phagosome is Rab9. Rab9 is required for the transport from late endosomes to the TGN and for lysosome biogenesis (Pfeffer, et al.,

be speculated that a low pH might function in recruiting RabGAP-5, which inactivates Rab5. The small G-protein Rab7 functions in the transition between early and late phagosomes and/or phagolysosomes. A recent fundamental breakthrough in understanding the role of the Rab5 to Rab7 switch on endocytic organelles, referred to as Rab conversion, has given insight

2004). Rab9 protein resides in a late endosome microdomain along with M6PR, which play a role in carrying newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes from the TGN to the endosomes, and the return to the Golgi (Ganley, et al., 2004). The stability of Rab9 on the late endosomes requires interaction with the effector tail-interacting protein of 47 kDa (TIP47), which binds directly to Rab9 and enhances its affinity for M6PR cytoplasmic domains (Carroll, et al., 2001).

(Boros, et al., 1991; Segal, et al., 1984). Fe mediated phagocytosis is dependant on PI3K and Ras super family pathways but the exact class, isoforms and regulatory factors are not known (Scott, et al., 2005; Vieira, et al., 2001). The function of one protein in a multi protein pathway may be of great importance, but the identification and isolation of all proteins in a complex may be more useful. Although surface proteins have been affinity captured from the cell plasma membrane by biotinylation (Sostaric, et al., 2006), the isolation of the whole super molecular

et al., 2003; Schuchardt, et al., 2008; Wu, et al., 2003). The assembly of a receptor complex with

The transition of the early phagosome into a mature, late phagosome, and eventually to the phagolysosome is mediated by Rab7, RILP, and LBPA (Vieira et al., 2002). The elevated concentrations of hydrolytic proteases and extreme acidity (pH 4.5-5) are characteristic of the phagolysosomes and are required in order to degrade the remaining cargo. Lysosomes and phagolysosomes share many markers with the late endosomes/phagosomes, including LAMPs, which can be best identified in "pulse-chase" labeling experiments through the delivery of internalized probes to a terminal, lysosomal compartment in ensured. Phagosome maturation is driven by a variety of cellular processes ranging from receptor biology, signal transduction, cytoskeletal remodeling, membrane trafficking and ion transport. All these biological processes follow an ordered sequence of events. From the number of various molecules described, there are still existing gaps in understanding the function of proteins in the entire phagocytic process that remain to be elucidated. The activation of the Fe receptor complex with IgG-opsonized micro particles stimulates the recruitment and assembly of proteins that play specific roles in the internalization of foreign particles. Specific proteins associated with the activated Fe receptor complex on the surface of cells have been studied by various methods including fluorescently tagged antibodies or proteins

all its participating molecules occurs only in live cells where the cellular energy, membranes, electrical potentials and active cytoskeleton are all required (Yeung, et al., 2006). Hence the Fe receptor complex was activated by a ligand opsonized microscopic beads and captured from the surface of live cells. The proteins of the internalized phagosome have been enumerated by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) (Foster, et al., 2006; Garin, et al., 2001) and the proteins of the Fe receptor complex have been collected on the cell surface by liquid chromatographyelectrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) (Jankowski, et al., 2008). Data generated by LC-ESI-MS/MS can be searched against a library of proteins to identify the peptides within the sample (McCormack, et al., 1997). Utilizing a data analysis software designed to correlate acquired tandem mass spectra of peptides with amino acid sequences from protein and nucleotide databases can be done quickly and efficiently using SEQUEST (Yates, et al., 1995). The list of peptides identified by the search algorithm SEQUEST can be analyzed based on cumulative unified scores, and fully tryptic sequences, if the samples were digested with trypsin, in order to eliminate false positive identification. To further investigate the true presence of the protein, confirmation by microscopy using the same

IgG-opsonized micro beads, fluorescently labeled antibodies, and protein constructs fused with GFP may be used (Jankowski et al., 2008). In this study three proteins identified with high cumulative scores by LC-ESI-MS/MS, were analyzed by laser confocal microscopy in order to confirm their presence at the activated Fe receptor complex. Analysis dfe Fe receptor associated proteins by LC-ESI-MS/MS has identified many known and previously studied proteins of the phagocytic receptor (Botelho, et al., 2000; Chung,
et al., 2000; Ellis, et al., 1991). Many low-abundance regulatory protein isoforms relevant to the

suggest which members of the Ras superfamily are likely to play a role in phagocytosis. Moreover there is need to infer which proteins are likely to regulate the Rap function in the Fe receptor pathway. The members of the Ras superfamily of small GTP binding proteins is evident in the data obtained from LARC and the controls but some of the activators and effectors of this group of proteins are only evident in the LARC data and not the controls, such as the inactivating protein for Ras, pl20RasGAP, and the activating protein of Rap1, a GTP binding protein belonging to the superfamily of Ras proteins, Rap 1GEF. This study will target the reliability of the mass spectrometric data obtained by LARC for Rapl, p120RasGAP and Rap1GEF, as well as verify the presence of these low abundance, signal transduction proteins at the site of the activated receptor complex.

The agreement between proteins identified by live-cell affinity receptor chromatography (LARC) with previously identified molecules of the Fe receptor that were studied by biochemical and genetic methods supports the discovery of novel proteins associated with the receptor complex.

Furthermore, the recruitment of proteins signal the initiation and termination of various cellular processes by binding GTP molecules.

successive steps in phagocytic uptake by mammalian cells (Fig. 2). A group of GTPases belonging to the Rho family, Cdc42 and Rae, have been confirmed to localize to the site of particle binding during phagocytosis, where Cdc42 regulates pseudopod extension and Rae regulates phagosome closure (Caron, et al., 1998; Castellano, et al., 2001). GTP bound Cdc42, Rac1 and Rac2 have been implicated as distinct regulators that coordinate the rearrangement of actin and membranes during phagocytosis in macrophages via the downstream activation of the Arp 2/3 complex which functions to localize and orient actin polymerization to the site of particle binding (Hoppe, et al., 2004). Rap1, another member of the Ras superfamily has been linked to signaling pathways that enable adhesion-like receptors to actively internalize particles

G-proteins are present in two interconvertible forms: GDP-bound inactive form and GTPbound active form. Molecular switches stimulate the upstream dissociation of GDP from the GDP-bound form that is followed by the binding of GTP, leading to a conformational change enabling the interaction and activation of downstream effectors. The rate-limiting step of the GDP/GTP exchange is the dissociation of GDP from the inactive form, which leads to the activation of G-proteins but this process is extremely slow. In order to catalyze the dissociation of GDP, regulators are necessary to speed up the reaction and convert G-proteins to an active GTP-bound form. Activation of small G-proteins is achieved by upstream regulators and downstream effectors. These regulators and effectors are recruited to the protein of interest and regulate the amplitude and the kinetics of signaling. It is this process that triggers a downstream

via phagocytosis (Caron, 2003). Although Rap1 has shown to be an essential prerequisite for the internalization of a complement-opsonized particle the mechanism of its action is still unclear. Several Rab proteins have also been found on phagosomal membranes including Rab3, Rab4, Rab5, Rab7, Rab9, Rab10, Rab11 and Rab14 (Desjardins, et al., 1994; Garin et al., 2001). In order to achieve fully functional phagocytosis a mechanism enabling membrane replenishment must be present to compensate for the net loss of the plasma membrane. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) and Rab11 are two GTPases essential in membrane delivery to the cell periphery. The function of Arf6 is essential for pseudopod extension around IgGopsonized particles and recycling the phagosomes to the plasma membrane or the nascent phagosomes (Niedergang, et al., 2003). Similarly Rab11 regulates phagosome recycling and is also required for optimal Fe receptor mediated phagocytosis (Cox, et al., 2000). Other Rab

19

proteins are mostly involved in phagosome maturation, such as Rab5 that functions in early phagosome fusion and Rab7 that acts as a marker in the late phagosome (Roberts et al., 2000; Vieira, et al., 2003). Aside from the functions mentioned previously little is known about the remaining isoforms and their roles. Currently the numbers of proteins interacting with G-proteins that modulate activation and downstream signaling is increasing and the ongoing study to provide insight about their functions in the mechanism of phagocytosis continues.

Ras proteins
As members of the G family of proteins, Ras proteins function as fundamental regulatory switches that control normal cell growth and differentiation by cycling between active and inactive confirmations at the plasma membrane. Deregulation of the activated Ras family has drawn much attention to this specific group of G-proteins when its members were identified in signaling cascades involved in oncogenesis (Grewal, et al., 2006; Hancock, 2003). Structurally, Ras proteins are 30-55% homologous to one another and all share consensus amino acid sequences responsible for specific interaction with GDP, GTP and GTPase, as well as a region

This theoretical model illustrates the subsequent steps during phagocytosis upon binding of an IgG-opsonized microbead followed by Fe receptor activation and the GTPases that regulate the signaling cascades involved in adhesion dependant activation, actin polymerization and pseudopod extension, membrane delivery and phagosome maturation.

interacting with downstream effectors (Bourne, et al., 1991). The activation of Ras and its members is dependant on the ratio of bound GTP to GDP and since Ras proteins have a slow rate of GTP/GDP exchange and possess low GTPase activity these processes are regulated by GAPs and GEFs also known as guanine nucleotide exchange proteins (GEPs) (Cullen, et al., 2002; Donovan, et al., 2002; Quilliam, et al., 2002). These regulators facilitate the exchange of GDP-

Regulation of Ras activity
The Ras superfamily cycles between two conformational forms induced by the binding of either GDP or GTP. GEFs induce the dissociation of GDP from Ras and allow for its association with GTP, which in tum is hydrolyzed to GDP through the intrinisic GTPase activity of GAPs. A number of specific GAPs and GEFs for Ras have been identified that are essential for the normal functioning of Ras. The GAPs associated with Ras are: p120GAP, neurofibromin, and GAPl, and the GEFs are: son of sevenless (SOS), Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (GRP), Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing factor (GRF) (Zwartkruis, et al., 1999). Little is known about how the GAPs and GEFs are regulated, but it has been proposed that GAPs can have additional functions as effectors of Ras signaling (Clark, et al., 1997; Medema, et al., 1992). Effectors of Ras are proteins that specifically bind to and are activated by the GTP-bound form of Ras and the activation of effectors usually results from the translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. Activation of plasma membrane receptors leads to the recruitment of GEFs, which stimulate the activation of Ras, subsequently activating its effectors that signal cellular pathways. For instance, the activation the receptor tyrosine kinase leads to the recruitement of GEFs that activate Ras and in tum activate its effector Raf-1, from which the phosphorylation cascade proceeds, translocating extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which promotes gene transcription (Wittinghofer, 1998). The downstream function of the ERK/MAPK pathway renders the Ras family of GTPases proto-oncogenic, since mutations leading to continuous activation of Ras are among the most prevalent in human cancers. The Ras-Raf-MAP kinase pathways have been most extensively studied however, Ras also activates PI3K which has been implicated in mitogenic signaling and inhibition of apoptosis,

thus confirming its involvement in intracellular protein degradation process in cell growth control (Lee, et al., 2002). Other known effectors for Ras are the pliO catalytic subunit of PI3K, Ral GDP dissociating stimulator (GDS), afadin (AF6), Byr2 protein kinase (homolog to mammalian MAP kinase), and as mentioned Raf-1 (Goldfinger, 2008). Ras functions as a molecular switch linking receptor kinase activation to downstream cytoplasmic or nuclear events through two key effectors: Raf and class I PI3K (Furuta, et al., 2004; Rodriguez-Viciana, et al., 1997). Class I PI3K associate with an adapter molecule of 85 kDa containing two Src homology2 (SH2) domains. The function of the p85 subunit allows PI3K to migrate from the cytosol to the membrane where its pliO catalytic subunit can bind to Ras and activate PI3K (Baumgartner et
al., 2000).

p120RasGAP
The p120RasGAP is a key element of the Ras signaling pathway of small inner membrane-localized G-proteins that are known to regulate gene expression in cellular processes such as differentiation, migration, polarity, growth and death (Olson, et al., 2000; Takashi Matozaki, 2000). p120RasGAP was the first GAP to be characterized at a molecular level and is active on Ha-Ras, Ki-Ras, N-Ras and R-Ras but not on Rho/Rac/Rab proteins (Table 1) (Boguski, et al., 1993; Gibbs, et al., 1988; Trahey, et al., 1987). This negative regulator ofRas is a cytosolic protein that stimulates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras through its C-terminal GAP domain (Trahey, et al., 1988; Vogel, et al., 1988). The GAPs facilitate the switch between the active GTP-bound Ras to the inactive GDP-bound Ras, thus effectively switching the GTPase off and inactivating Ras (Bar-Sagi, et al., 2000; Etienne-Manneville, et al., 2002; Mackay, et al., 1998). Ras proteins have been known to function irregularly in certain cancers,

21

24

leading to decreased apoptosis and increased invasion and metastasis (Adari, et al., 1988; Downward, 2003). Other studies have addressed the importance of the GAPs for Ras in cell motility, whereby RasGAP is directly involved in cell movement and indirectly involved in complex formation to direct orientation and migration (Sarang V. Kulkarni, et al., 2007) . Therefore, it is important to focus on the specific roles of the p120 RasGAP and the selective pathways that these proteins regulate in cellular functions. Since RasGAP has been proposed to participate in cell signaling, identifying its partners is an essential step in understanding its regulatory function (Pronk, et al., 1994). The binding domain of the 120 kDa GAP for Ras plays an essential role in the recruitment of some proteins to the cell periphery (Bradley, et al., 2006). These domains include two SH2 domains, an Src homology-3 (SH3) domain, and pleckstrin homology (PH) and protein kinase C2 homology domains in addition to the GAP domain. The orientaion of the binding domains from the NH2 -terminal region contains two SH2 domains flanking an SH3 domain, a central region containing CalB and PH domains and the carboxy-terminal responsible for the catalysis that drives the conversion of Ras-GTP to Ras-GDP (Fig. 3) (Gawler, et al., 1995; Pawson, 1995). These domains mediate the recruitment of RasGAP to the membranes and their receptors whereby it subsequently localizes to Ras.

The binding domains of p120 RasGAP have been closely studied and many interacting proteins have been identified for each domain. The SH2 domains bind phosphorylated tyrosine residues and in RasGAP have been noted to interact with p56, p62do\ and p190 RhoGAP (Di Cristofano, et al., 1998; Ellis, et al., 1990). Other important molecules such as an SH2 domaincontaining tyrosine phosphatase (SHP2) has been shown to down-regulate phosphorylation and disengage RasGAP, thus sustaining Ras activation by the interaction of Gab1 with the RasGAP SH2 domains (Montagner, et al., 2005). The SH3 domains are conserved in many cellular signaling proteins and mediate protein interactions via specific proline-containing peptides. The complex formation of p190 RhoGAP with p120 RasGAP upon tyrosine phosphorylation results in a conformational change that exposes the target binding surface of the RasGAP SH3 domain allowing for additional protein interactions (Hu, et al., 1997). Furthermore, one of the RasGAP SH3 domain binding protein is G3BP, a 68 kDa cytosolic protein containing two RNA-binding domains that signify that this interaction may modulate translational efficiency of mRNA and is essential for proper growth and development (Parker, et al., 1996; Zekri, et al., 2005). The carboxy-terminal catalytic domain interacts with and enhances the GTPase activity of protooncogenic p21 Ras and acts as a direct negative regulator of p21 Ras signaling by accelerating Ras GTPase activity (Adari et al., 1988; Zhang, et al., 1990).

Figure 3: The Human RasGap protein (Swiss-Prot, P20936). RasGAP contains a total of 1047 amino acid residues with the amino terminal region consisting of the SH3 domain flanked by two SH2 domains, followed by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a membrane targeting C2 domain, and a GTPase activating domain (GAP) at the carboxy-terminal.

Rap proteins
Another group of small GTPases belonging to the Ras family of proteins are Raps, which are regulated by an array of specific GEFs and GAPs. Rap1 has been noted to regulate various cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, cytoskeletal rearrangement, MAPK

-~ltmlltW-L.i.ll till2:')

signaling, cadherin-mediated cell junction, as well as integrin-mediated cell adhesion (Bos, 2005;

2n

Bos, et al., 2001; Stork, 2003). There are five isoforms of Rap: RaplA, RaplB, Rap2A, Rap2B, and recently discovered Rap2C, (Paganini, et al., 2006) with which RaplA and RaplB share more than 90% sequence homology and show no distinct variation in cellular functions and for the purpose of consistency will be referred to as Rap 1 from now on. Recently Rap 1 was shown to be present at the site of the activated phagocytic receptor in RAW 264.7 macrophages (Jankowski et al., 2008). Rapl is a monomeric, Ras-like small GTPase regulator that functions in cellular processes by coupling signals generated within the cellular membranes to intracellular effectors. The signal transduction of Rap 1 is common to that of Ras due to the similarities of the effector domain region between Rap and Ras. The activation of Rapl is mediated by distinct GEFs that increase the concentration of GTP-bound Rapl to elicit a cellular response. The localization of Rap 1 has been monitored and shown to recruit to perinuclear structures (Y anhong Liao, et al., 2001), TGN (Caron, 2003; Johannes L. Bos, et al., 2001), lysosomal vesicles (Johannes L. Bos et al., 2001), endosomes (Caron, 2003; Chengbiao Wu, et al., 2001; Randall D. York, et al., 2000), and most interestingly, the plasma membrane (Xianlong Gao, et al., 2001; Yusuke Ohba, et al., 2003). For some cellular responses, the choice of cell-type-specific Rapl exchangers may both activate Rap 1 and direct it to a specific target. As is the case with many GTP binding proteins, the roles of Rap and its associated proteins in cellular functions are complex and not yet fully understood. However, evidence has suggested that Rap exerts biological activities in cellular growth and differentiation as well as in phagocyte specific pathways eluting to the fact that Rap may play a very specific role in certain cells (Bokoch, 1993). There are various specific inactivating GAPs associated with the signaling pathways of Rap. The GAPs specific for Rap are RaplGAP (Rubinfeld, et al., 1991), the tuberous sclerosis

complex 2 product tuberin (Wienecke, et al., 1995), and SPA-I (signal-induced proliferation associated gene- I) (Hattori, et al., 1995). Specific RapGAP activities have been detected in the cytosol and the plasma membrane of different cells (Kikuchi, et al., 1989; Ueda, et al., 1989). Numerous GEFs have been identified as activators ofRapl, including C3G (a homolog to RaplGEF), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) GEFs, Ca2+ and/or diacylglycerol (DAG) activated GEFs (CalDAG-GEFs) and PDZ-GEFs (Bos et al., 2001; Ehrhardt, et al., 2002). Rapl has been proven to be vital for various morphogenic processes in migration and cell shape and mutations of Rapl impair embryo development is some organisms (Asha, et al., 1999; HaenaLopez, et al., 2005). Mutations of the Rapl effectors have also been shown to cause significant effects in signaling pathways. C3G binds through the proline-rich domain (PRD) to the SH3 domain of Crk, an adaptor protein involved in tyrosine kinase-dependant activation of Rapl occurring on membrane receptors and adaptor proteins (Gotoh, et al., 1995). cAMP-GEFs contain two cyclic nucleotide binding domains (CNBDs) one of which, cAMP binds and activates thereby stimulating Rap-dependant signaling (Bos et al., 2001; de Rooij, et al., 1998). CalDAG-GEFs are regulated by distinct calcium and DAG binding domains and were identified as a critical regulator in inside.,.out integrin activation in human T lymphocytes, neutrophils, and platelets (Kawasaki, et al., 1998; Pasvolsky, et al., 2007). PDZ-GEFs are recruited to membrane receptors and proteins via cAMP-binding domains and a PDZ domain that is specific for Rapl and Rap2, a close relative ofRapl (de Rooij, et al., 1999). The function of GEFs and GAPs is cyclical and complimentary, where GEFs promote the conversion of GDP-bound or inactive form of small G protein to GTP-bound or active forms and GAPs enhance the hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP. Ras and Rapl proteins have both been shown to recruit to the plasma and endosomal membranes (Ehrhardt et al., 2002; Hancock,

27

2R

2003). Ras and Rap1 share extensive homology within the regions involved in effector binding and both bind to the effectors Raf-1, B-Raf, RalGDS and AF-6 (Bos et al., 2001). Rap1 antagonizes the actions of Ras in a variety of cellular systems, but it also enhances Ras action in others (Stork, 2003). The similarity between Ras and Rap are evident and the individually distinct cellular effects that they exert may be due to the consequence of their localization. Ras residing in the plasma membrane and Rap in the perinuclear membrane compartments may result in differential signaling (Mochizuki, et al., 2001). These two signaling molecules have been of interest in recent studies due to their involvement in a wide range of cellular processes, however, due to the extreme diversity of signal transduction their actions still lack full consensus. The direct association of Rap with the phagocytic receptors can be demonstrated by molecules common to both the protein and the process. Recent findings suggest that Rap signaling positively contributes to cadherin-mediated adhesion (Price, et al., 2004). The route of entry by pathogens through the host cell phagocytic pathway is mediated by adhesion molecules that bind E-catherin (Mengaud, et al., 1996). E-catherin is a transmembrane adhesion molecule important in the formation and maintnance of cell contacts in solid tissue. In this light, it is possible that Rap may function to regulate cell-surface adhesion receptors, such as the phagocytic receptor. It has also been shown that Ras regulates the activation of PI3K, the key regulatory element of endocytic trafficking. Although the main GTPases that drive the phagocytic pathway belong to the Rab subfamily of small G-proteins, there are many functions within phagocytosis that are still not yet explained and provide the rational that Ras and its associated members may also play unknown roles in phagocytosis.

RATIONALE
Considerable evidence is available from the genetic and biochemical analysis of the innate immune system and the signaling agents associated with the Fe receptor that might be potential therapeutic targets for the prevention of immune associated diseases. Over the last two decades substantial progress in the understanding of signal transduction at a molecular level has resulted in the identification of signaling cascades involved in innate immunity. The Fe receptor signaling pathway and actin assembly resulting in pseudopod extension and remodeling of the cell membrane has been extensively studied and is best understood in comparison to other cell surface receptors (Aderem et al., 1999; Cox, et al., 1999). The uptake of IgG coated particles by phagocytic cells is well established, thus making the Fe receptor an ideal surface receptor to use as an experimental model (Kasai, et al., 1982). The effect of many proteins at the cell surface as activators or inhibitors leads to complex downstream signaling pathways that are still not well understood. The use of liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry is a practical method that can be used to identify most regulatory proteins of the Fe receptor pathway. However the sensitivity of these instruments is still not at its ideal level and extensive sample preparation is required, thus further investigation of these proteins via biochemical analysis is necessary. p 120RasGAP may regulate some Ras-dependant cellular processes and has been shown to be important in growth and development through its association with key regulatory proteins. The determination of p120 RasGAP at the site of the activated receptor in RAW 264.7 macrophages will further expand our understanding of this complex protein and its regulatory functions that have been shown to promote downstream signaling aside from inactivation of Ras (Clark et al., 1997; Wittinghofer, 1998). GAPs and GEFs may direct the immediate response to

human immune diseases. Monoclonal mouse anti-Ras-GAP was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Jose, CA). Monoclonal rabbit anti-Rap1A/Rap1B was obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies, Inc. (Danvers, MA), monoclonal rabbit anti-C3G was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc (Santa Cruz, CA). Cy2-, Cy3-, and Cy5- conjugated anti-rabbit and antimouse secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). The 2 micron polystyrene beads were obtained from Bangs Laboratories (Fishers, IN). Human IgG and all other reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated.

Nucleic acids

The following plasmids encoding p 120 RasG AP and Rap 1A were used in these experiments. Construct for p232-mRFP-NI, was generously provided by William D. Bradley (Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven) (William
D. Bradley, et al., 2006). The p232-mRFP-Nl construct consisted of the SH2-SH3-SH2 (232

kDa) domains of p120 RasGAP were cloned into the pmRFP-Nl vector (Clontech's pEYFP-N1 vector with EYFP excised and mRFP from Roger Tsein cloned into the Agel and Not1 sites). The mRFP sequence is 3' to the 232 sequence, resulting in a carboxyl-terminal tag constructed by Tony Koleske and Bill Bradley. Primer information is not known, however, template was likely pRcHA-p120RasGAP from Jeff Settleman. 232 was cloned into the pmRFP-Nl vector using Xhol and Agel. This 232 fragment of p120RasGAP binds to the RasGAP binding region of p190RhoGAP disrupting its ability to bind p120RasGAP. This event will disrupt the

translocation of p190RhoGAP to the cell periphery and prevents its ability to inhibit RhoA in vivo (Bradley eta/., 2006). Constructs for EGFP-Rap1A (in pFLAG-CMV-2) were generously donated by Dr.Tohru Kataoka (Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Kobe University, Japan). A BamH II BamH I fragments encoding wildtype Rap1A was subcloned into the BamH I site of the mammalian expression vector pFLAG-CMV-2 and a Hind III/Hind III fragment encoding EGFP was inserted into the Hind III site of pFLAG-CMV-2 (Xianlong Gao et al., 2001).

(FA-078A, Thermo Electron, Waltham, MA, USA) and the beads were isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation (Beckamn, USA) (Jankowski et al., 2008). The protein fraction obtained from the extractions was digested with trypsin and analyzed by LC-MS/MS in at least three replicates alongside controls as described by Jankowski et al., (2008). The MS/MS data files generated by the LC-ESI-ion trap were searched against a non-redundant library of proteins using the SEQUEST algorithm, with scoring conditions and settings recommended by the manufacturer (Chelius, et al., 2002; Yates, 1998).

Celllysates were prepared by scraping cells that were grown to 80-90% confluency in a 75 cm2 culture flask in cell culture conditions. Approximately 5 ml of 2xSDS-PAGE sample buffer containing approximately 5mM PMSF, 5mM AEBSF, 5mM EDT A salt and eukaryotic anti-protease cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the scraped cells and immediately heated for 1Omin at 100Â°C. Approximately 30 !-!1 of cell lysate alongside a molecular weight marker was run on discontinuous polyacrylamide gels with 4% monomer stacking gels with Tris pH 6.8 and 7% monomer separating gels with tris pH 8.8 in tricine anode and cathode buffers (Schagger, et al., 1987). Proteins from SDS-PAGE were transferred to Immobilon-P Transfer Membrane, 0.45!-!m pore size (Millipore, Bedford, MA) (Burnette, 1981). The membrane was stained with Coomassie stain with no acetic acid, destained with 50% methanol, dried, and marked with a pencil indicating the location of the molecular weight marker bands. The membrane was soaked in 100% methanol until completely de-stained and blocked with PBST (PBS + 0.1% Tween) 5% skim milk, and 1% goat serum for 30 min. After blocking, membranes were washed 3 times with PBST prior to incubating with 1:2000 primary antibody for RasQAP, Rap1A/Rap1B, or C3G, in PBST for 30 min, and washed 3 times again.

Sheep red blood cells (SRBC) or 2 micron polystyrene beads were opsonized with rabbit anti-SRBC or human IgG at room temperature, for 30min and washed three times with 1xPBS as described previously (Marshall J.G., et al., 2001). Cells grown on glass cover slips were incubated with opsonized particles for 5-7 min at 37 Â°C. Cover slips with cells were put on ice and washed with ice cold PBS and fixed for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1xPBS. The fixed cells were gently washed 3 times with 1xPBS and then 3 times with 1xPBS and 5% glycine. After this step cells were either left overnight in 1xPBS with 0.1% MgCl at 4Â°C or were permeablized with 0.1% Triton in 1xPBS (or PBST) for 30 min before blocking. Cells were blocked with 5% skim milk and 1% donkey serum in lxPBST for 1 hour. After blocking the cover slips were washed 3 times with 1xPBST. On the cleaned cover of the 6 well plate, 24 !-!1 of PBST was spotted and incubated with 1 !-!1 primary antibody, the cover slips were then placed face down on the 25!-!1 spot, avoiding air bubbles, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Then the cover slips were placed back in the wells and washed 3 times with 1xPBST. Cells were incubated with the cy2-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:20000 dilution in 1xPBS for 30 min at room temperature. The cover slips were washed 3-5 times with 1xPBS and fixed onto microscope slides with DAKO (Dako, Denmark) until dry and analyzed using a laser confocal microscope.

internalized (Fig. 7). The localization of Rap1A/Rap1B to the cell periphery is also indicated by an increase in fluorescence at the bead that is bound to the Fe receptor and not for the beads that have already been internalized (Fig. 7). C3G antibody staining was done to predict the presence of GEFs for Rap due to the lack of reagents for other GEFs. As an indicator, C3G shows strong

accumulation near the bound beads (Fig. 7). Thus antibody staining showed increased fluorescence at the bead suggesting the recruitment of RasGAP and Rap1A/Rap1B to the site on the plasma membrane as well as a potential activator or isoform of C3G, a GEF for Rap, where the receptor complex was activated by the binding of the ligand coated beads (Fig. 7).

cells were incubated with IgG-opsonized beads, fixed and stained only with the secondary antibody conjugated to cy3 anti-mouse and anti-rabbit and imaged using the same settings as for the cells stained with both the primary and secondary antibodies. The control stained with only donkey anti-mouse cy3 secondary antibody revealed no fluorescence at the bead (Fig. 7) signifying that the signal obtained for RasGAP is true, and there is no non-specific binding. The control stained only with donkey anti-rabbit cy3 secondary antibody revealed fluorescence specifically at the bead and nowhere else in the cell (Fig. 7). This implies that the anti-rabbit

secondary antibody reacts with the human IgG, which the beads were coated with and that the signal obtained for Rap1A (Fig.7) is a summed fluorescence of the localization of Rap1A to the bead and the fluorescence from the bead alone. The anti-rabbit cy3 antibody staining seems to be significantly present on the bead itself within the cy3 donkey anti-rabbit (Cy3DantiR) secondary antibody control, however with the cells that were stained with Rap 1A/Rap 1B and C3G the distribution of fluorescence seems to be present within the body of the cell and predominantly around the bound beads instead of the entire surface of the bead. Rap 1A/Rap 1B stained cells seem to fluoresce throughout the cytosol and form a haze around the bound bead but do not display a specific increase in fluorescence within the internalized beads. The same can be seen for C3G staining, where the whole body of the cell fluoresces as well as the plasma membrane around the bound particles and not in particularly the whole bead in comparison to the cy3 antirabbit controls. Although non-specific binding was observed for the anti-rabbit secondary controls, the signal seems to be the strongest only at the bead and not throughout the cell body.

Confirmation by confocal microscopy with transfected fusion proteins
The accumulation of p 120RasGAP and Rap 1 in the stimulated phagocytes was studied by transient transfection of fusion proteins consisting of essential binding domains linked to GFP or RFP. Cells transfected with the EGFP-Rap1A wildtype construct and the p232-mRFP-N1 dominant negative construct were visualized by live-cell confocal microscopy to study the localization of these proteins to the site on the plasma membrane where the receptor was activated by a ligand-coated bead. In the cells transfected with the Rap1A linked to EGFP it is evident from the fluorescence intensity that Rap 1A localizes through the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane but is not present in the nucleus (Fig. 8). The line scan corresponding to the distribution of Rap 1A within the cell indicates a uniform distribution of fluorescence throughout the body of the cell where there is no bead bound to the surface of the cell. The fluorescence drops significantly at the nucleus and spikes again in the cytosol of cell near the nucleus and slightly less at the bead. Although the fluorescence intensity at the phagocytic cup is comparable to that of the entire cell, the cup formation is evident and Rap 1A, a cytosolic protein, localizes to the membrane, thus possibly participating in the uptake of the ligand-coated particle.

The distribution of RasGAP in the stimulated phagocyte was studied by transient transfection of a fusion protein consisting of the SH2-SH3-SH2 binding domain of p 120RasGAP linked to RFP. The fluorescence distribution of the line scan shows intensity saturation at the phagocytic cup, then drops down at the nucleus and spikes again within the body of the cell (Fig. 9). The distribution of p232-mRFP-Nl indicated that the binding partner for the binding domain of p 120RasGAP is present in the cytosol and is recruited from the cytosol to the cell periphery upon activation of the Fe receptor complex. Interestingly, the distribution of the wildtype Rap and the binding region of p120RasGAP appears to be quite similar. The effect of the dominant negative construct that binds to the RasGAP binding region may have an effect on the number of particles taken up by the cell in comparison to the control cells. The cell transfected with p232-mRFP-Nl engulfs more IgG-opsonized beads than the neighboring cells that show no sign of transfection (Fig. 10). Thus it is possible that the dominant negative construct may have an effect on phagocytosis and disrupts the regulatory function of RasGAP at the site of the activated receptor and by binding RasGAP interferes with other signaling proteins necessary for regulation of phagocytosis.

DISCUSSION
In this study the member of Ras superfamily of GTP binding proteins, Rap and some regulatory proteins were identified by tandem mass spectrometry and confirmed by detection with antibodies, immunostaining, and transient transfections with GFP fusions of protein binding domains coupled to laser confocal microscopy. The mass spectrometry data for Rap, GAPs and GEFs shows significant scores, with at least three different peptides identified for each protein, as well as tryptically cleaved peptides. Data meeting all these aforementioned criteria has shown to eliminate false positives 95% of the time (Cargile et al., 2004). Here we conclude that based on cumulative scores the identification of Rap, GAPs and GEFs was accurate. Ras superfamily members are noted to be involved in vesicle transport and fusion. For instance, Rap proteins are consistent with the vesicular supply of plasma membrane during early events of phagocytosis (Pizon, et al., 1994; Seas tone, et al., 1999). The presence of Ras superfamily member Rap was observed in RAW 264.7 macrophages by LC-MS/MS. LCMS/MS was able to identify various isoforms of Rap including Rap I A, Rap1B, Rap2A, Rap2B, Rap 1/Rap2 and various other isoforms. Some isoforms of Rap were seen with higher relative scores and identified by a number of different tryptic peptides. A FASTA alignment for Rap1A indicated that the four peptides that were identified by tandem mass spectrometry were in fact aligned with the protein sequence listed by NCBI. Fragmentation spectra for the three selected peptides identified for Rap1A shows low noise and well resolved peaks thus signifying that the detection by SEQUEST and the spectra are reliable. / The analysis of collected samples by the LARC method has shown evidence for the presence of Rap activating GEFs . Among the different GEFs identified for Rap, there was evidence that Ras GEFs were also present in the samples. RapGEF1 and PDZ GEF were

identified with a greater number of peptides than other GEFs associated with Ras or Rap. The FAST A alignment of the RapGEFl correlated five peptide sequences to the full length protein sequence, thus suggesting that spectrometric analysis generated reliable results. Mass spectra for peptides specifically associated with RapGEFl shows well resolved peaks and low noise levels for the three peptides identified by LARC. It can be concluded that LARC was able to reveal some of the relevant isoforms of the Rap associated GEFs. Analysis of the captured activated receptor complex by LARC from the surface of live cells revealed the presence of GAP variants for Ras. A distinct presence of p120RasGAP was observed with relatively higher scores and greater number of peptides compared to other identified GAPs. This implies that RasGAPs are present within the activated receptor complex captured by LARC. The alignment of 6 different peptide sequences to the full length FAST A protein sequence confirmed that the sequences generated by tandem mass spectrometry were in agreement with the native sequence of the p120RasGAP protein. Good fragmentation patterns with high relative abundance and low noise were obtained for peptides correlated with the native sequence of p120RasGAP. Therefore, p120RasGAP and associated GAP isoforms were detected with high accuracy by the LARC method suggesting their localization to the activated receptor before it is internalized. Biochemical techniques supporting the association of Ras superfamily member Rap and its associated GEFs and GAPs indicate that these molecules are present in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Western blotting supported the presence of Rap 1/Rap2 in RAW 264.7 macrophages, although the associated p 120RasGAP and the RapGEF C3G were detected with less confidence possibly due to cleavage of these proteins within the whole cell lysate or due to degradation in strong detergents used in SDS-PAGE and sample buffer. Proteins bearing an

immunological relation to those observed by tandem mass spectrometry were confirmed by western blot. Therefore, it can be concluded that Rap, p 120RasGAP and RapGEF are present in 264.7 macrophages. Immunostaining of RAW 264.7 macrophages in the presence of an IgG-opsonized beads was used to further address the association of Rap, RasGAP and C3G. RasGAP was detected at the site of the activated receptor near the bead. The presence of RaplA/RaplB and C3G near the nascent phagosome was also seen in immunostained macrophages. Thus it can be concluded that RasGAP, RaplA/RaplB and C3G were observed at the site of the activated receptor near the bound particle in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Similarly, cells transfected with Rap 1 and p120RasGAP show distribution of fluorescence at the cup formation in live macrophages. Utilizing antibodies and fluorescent fusion proteins to detect Ras protein Rap, p120RasGAP, and RapGEF has indicated that these proteins localize to the activated receptor and may play a role in phagocytosis. Thus is can be concluded that Rap, RasGAP and RapGEF play a role at the activated Fe receptor complex however, further experimentation utilizing knock outs or silencing RNA is required to investigate further into the functions of these proteins and study the effects of suppression of there molecules during phagocytosis. The distribution of the Rapl and p120RasGAP within live macrophages is very comparable and may indicate that these two proteins act together in the phagocytic pathway. Another point supporting this argument may be the presence of a GAP for Ras within the mass spectrometry data, but a lack of Ras itself. Based on these preliminary results it can be hypothesized that the equal distribution of the binding domain of p 120RasGAP and Rap may suggest that RasGAP may play a role in the inactivation of Rap or be its downstream effector. The support provided by mass spectrometry data for the presence of Rap GEFs at the activated

()()

receptor contributes to support the theory that Rap is activated and may interact with p120RasGAP. I conclude that p120Ras GAP and Rap1 showed localization to the activated Fe receptor complex by live cell confocal microscopy and therefore are associated with the receptor complex. Further investigation into the signaling pathway of these Ras proteins may provide sufficient evidence for this argument. There is much support for the association of Rap with integrin mediated cell adhesion implying that Rap is associated with the stage of the phagocytic pathway that has to do with the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton at the surface of the cell in the formation of the phagocytic cup (Pizon et al., 1994; Seastone et al., 1999). However the association of GAPs and GEFs that trigger pathways of Rap are not well understood and their functions are not yet known. Rabs are currently the GTPases that drive the early stages of phagocytosis, but not all their interactions and functions are known (Vieira et al., 2002). Belonging to the same family of small G-proteins, Rabs and Ras both act as molecular switches that mediate signaling of cellular functions. This study shows the association of the Ras superfamily member Rap and it's associated GAPs and GEFs. Therefore, it is possible that the Ras family of proteins and its associated regulatory molecules may play a significant role in the phagocytic pathway. Ras and Rap are higly homologous and it may be possible that they share common effectors. It has been proposed that Rap functions as an antagonist by trapping Ras effectors in an inactive complex and if overexpressed, it can revert to the morphological phenotype of K-Ras (Kitayama, et al., 1989). Although this has been documented, it is not the case for all scenarios, and Rap is not always found to be capable of reverting to the transformed phenotype charecteristic of Ras transformed cells (Sato, et al., 1994). The overexpression of Rap can interfere in Ras effector signaling, but it has been shown that it is unlikely that Rap activation

solely serves to repress Ras signaling. Here, we propose that this might be the case. The detection of the p 120RasGAP and RapGEF isoforms by tandem mass spectrometry may suggest that these two molecules regulate Rap, however further studies to investigate this argument are still required.

CONCLUSION
Mass spectrometry was able to accurately identify Ras superfamily member Rap, its associated GEF proteins and GAPs. The LARC method has shown evidence to capture receptor associated proteins by mass spectrometry and further confirm their localization to the Fe receptor by confocal microscopy (Jankowski et al., 2008) with high accuracy, thus suggesting that the Ras inactivator p120GAP may in fact be present at the activated complex. Additionally, antibody staining has shown that Rap, p 120RasGAP and C3G are recruited to the cell membrane at the site of the activated receptor near the bound bead. Expression of fluorescent fusion proteins of the p 120RasGAP binding domain and Rap was observed within the cytosol and near the phagocytic cup in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Ras family of proteins, especially Rap and their associated GAPs and GEFs, may play a role in phagocytosis and further in triggering an innate immune response, although further evidence is required to establish the mechanisms involved.

FUTURE OBJECTIVES
Future directions that may provide more support for the arguments made in this study could focus on establishing evidence for the function that p120RasGAP and RapGEF may play in phagocytosis. The ability to use mass spectrometry and antibodies for the detection of specific proteins near the sight of the activated Fe receptor is sufficient for gaining a foundation in the investigation of molecular signaling within a cellular pathway. However, further study is required to identify the various isoforms and track their activity throughout the entire process of internalizing ligated particles. The use of GFP fused constructs of the critical binding domains of Ras, Rap, p120RasGAP and RapGEF are all required to track the activation of Rap and the deactivation of Ras simultaneously. Also the use of dominant negative constructs that have the ability to interfere with the native binding of these interacting molecules is also necessary in order to investigate the physical effect on phagocytosis. Another method that can be used to completely investigate the role of these molecules is by using silencing RNA. Silencing RNA has the ability to silence or significantly reduce the expression of a specific protein within a cellular network thus enabling the study of the proteins function in phagocytosis. For instance, reduced phagocytosis upon silencing of a specific protein will render that protein as an essential signaling molecule in the uptake of pathogens. Confocal microscopy enables the visualization of the effects that dominant negatives or silencing RNA may have on the role of Ras, Rap, 120RasGAP, and RapGEF in the uptake of opsonized particles. Phagocytosis assays to investigate the potential of phagocytosis in cells that have been transfected with silencing RNA or dominant negatives can provide a statistical analysis of the effects on the uptake of ligated particles as well (Steinberg, et al., 2007). In this light further experimentation is required to identify the roles of these molecules in the Fe receptor complex although, mass spectrometry

70

data and immunostaining has provided evidence that these molecules are present during phagosytosis. Inactivation of Ras by various drugs can also provide potential methods for analyzing the contribution of Ras and its related proteins to the activated Fe receptor. Manumycin A is a Ras specific inhibitor that was shown to inactivate class I PI3K (Li, et al., 2007). Further investigation of the actions of this inhibitor could lend further insight on the role of Ras protein in the activation of the Fe receptor.
