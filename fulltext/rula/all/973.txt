It goes on to show that discussing interaction associated with photovoltaic materials and building forms is one essential step in the process of decision making.

1.3 Literature review

Many books have studied the micro features of photovoltaic materials. However, few documents contribute to material studies on a macro-scale. Most of them refer to the field only in an engineering manner therefore missing ample opportunities for creative form-making in photovoltaic integration, and for conveying architectural meaning through

Can photovoltaic technologies present opportunities for creative architectural design?
Hermannsdorfer and Rub (2005) state: ...they [solar facilities] can enhance the architecture, accentuate it and distinguish it

from the mass; they can express adaptation and transformation or modernity while at the same time preserving the traditional features" (p. 9).To demonstrate this, a German-Italian team conducted a research project, PVACCEPT, to improve the aesthetic design of photovoltaic materials, focusing on new applications of
photovoltaic materials in existing or historic buildings. Photovoltaic modules are generally used as surface materials. Thus both the materiality and technology of photovoltaic materials are critical aspects of creative architectural design.

building forms.

Research into photovoltaic materials on a macro-scale uncovers opportunities for

creative architectural design. Moreover, the paper intends to explore principles of creative photovoltaic integration by analyzing building form-making and relevant tradeoffs.

Johan Bettum (2002) stated "the focus on surface articulation is fundamentally linked to, even
uniquely expressed as, a corresponding interest in materials and material technology" (p. 72). This perspective will assist architects discovering the aesthetic values of photovoltaic technologies on a two-dimensional level.

Besides the technology and materiality of photovoltaic materials, I believe the interaction between building forms and photovoltaic materials is one of the major aspects of creative

architectural design. A discussion of the relationship between surface and architecture can be found in Bettum's article (2002): In contrast to approaches based on types of topology or topography, current concerns with surface articulation are subject to the possibilities and resistances of the surface
as a three-dimensional material entity. The surface must therefore be conceptualized and designed with respect to its depth, (p. 25)

Bettum also suggests architects have to think of surface materials in both micro-scale
and macro-scale. Material studies in micro-scale are limited to the individual characteristics of

selective surface materials. Material studies in macro-scale investigate the optical, physical

and scientific phenomena of materials in applications by observing and analyzing the
connection between selected materials and other materials. Through macro and micro

studies architects can better comprehend building materials by integrating architecturally
innovative ideas with them.

Without knowledge of photovoltaic materiality, practical solutions for this dilemma cannot be achieved. To explore the transparency of photovoltaic materials, for instance,

started to experiment with integrating photovoltaic systems into buildings. Early applications

Photovoltaic materials are evolving. Recently, crystalline silicon and thin-film have become two major technologies of the photovoltaic industry. The major difference in

of Building Integration of Photovoltaic (BIPV) systems dated back to the 1980s, when large
photovoltaic plants were established in many advanced industrial countries, such as Germany, Japan, and the United States. Some European architectural firms, such as Kiss + Cathcart Architects, and Bear Architecten in Germany, engaged in BIPV research and design
in the same period (Lugue & Hegedus, 2003).

Their physical characteristics of both mainly refer to five aspects: transparency, colour,

Photovoltaic technologies were "born" in a period when contemporary architecture was involved in complicated discourse and practice. On the one hand, the development of the post-modern architecture movement inspired many young architects. Material assemblage,

other hand, theoretical thinking on the preservation of classical tradition spread through Europe, America, and Asia (Fazio, Moffett, & Woodhouse, 2008).

Typical crystalline photovoltaic modules consist of crystalline cells. Usually, the

crystalline cell size is approximately 150 x 150 mm; these cells are "glued" in transparent

"sandwich" glass sheets. These panel types vary from 200 x 200 mm to 2000 x 3000 mm.
Some solar panel sizes and their relevant properties in selected manufacturing can be

Manufacturers provide both opaque and semi-transparent photovoltaic products. Individual crystalline silicon cells are opaque, while thin film cells based on cadmium-telluride (CdTe) or copper-indium-diselenide (CIS) are semi-transparent. By arranging the pattern of
crystalline silicon cells or changing the cells' shape, photovoltaic panels can have relative

circulation areas. Along the Trinity Street facade, the architects integrated thin-film panels
into the building's curtain wall in order to reduce the stress that the building's volume brings to

The efficiency of photovoltaic systems influences the performance of photovoltaic cells, indirectly impacting on the market acceptance of photovoltaic systems. Generally speaking,

whether a building is suitable for photovoltaic installation and what types of photovoltaic cells
can meet energy goals depend on the efficiency and cost of photovoltaic products.

The ideal solar cell efficiency limit of photovoltaic cells has a maximum value of 95%

To achieve higher efficiency,

one practical way in crystalline silicon technology is to increase the thickness of base

Evolution of photovoltaic building forms

Photovoltaic building forms are also evolving. Similar to organisms' evolution, building forms develop from simplicity to complexity, from monotone to variety. One economic reason for this is that capital costs of photovoltaic material keep falling due to economy of scale. Meanwhile, conversion efficiency, affecting photovoltaic materials for use as building
components, keeps increasing over time.

Some scientific facts explain why prototypes of photovoltaic buildings have been relatively simple in details. First, fragile photovoltaic materials such as silicon cells need

transparent materials, usually highly transparent glass, with reliable hardness for support. Second, different angles of the photovoltaic material towards the sun will generate different voltages, which can result in the failure or bad performance of the photovoltaic system. In addition to this, products those are easy and cheaper to manufacture dominated architects'
design of photovoltaic buildings. These factors influenced the architects' early explorations of form-making. However, architects are now attempting to break through this barrier against architectural design, as shown in the projects discussed in the following sections.

Because of functional and material limitations, a single mono-pitched roof doesn't satisfy as an architectural composition to arrange space and building materials. Besides, size, shape, and aesthetic quality will direct an architect to find other means to deal with photovoltaic panels. In this situation, multi-louver techniques as visual or semi-visual elements can be considered. This strategy is suitable for individual multi-storey buildings, such as hospitals, hotels, museums, and city halls. The photovoltaic louver can be a major or

minor component of a building. Balance and equilibrium can be achieved through delicate architectural composition. In this case, surface consciousness is raised when photovoltaic
louvers are mounted on a building facade (see Figure 5).

Rather than being translated into buildings gracefully, photovoltaic technologies

radically changed buildings' forms at an early stage of Building Integration of Photovoltaic systems (BIPV). In this early period, building forms were not made particularly for this technology. On the one hand, the low efficiencies of photovoltaic technology required a relatively large surface area on buildings, which usually for other building components. On
the other hand, the high cost forced architects to consider technical function first. As a result,

prototypes of photovoltaic integrated buildings were designed in a more engineering way. To maximize energy generation from these expensive but low efficiency materials, architects

had to sacrifice most of the roof areas, tilting them into optimizing angles. So the building space had to become the secondary consideration in a photovoltaic building. As a result, these prototypes were not attractive to ordinary people. This posed the question of functional
conflict (see Figure 4).

A factory in Germany (see Figure 6) is an example of a whole facade installed with

photovoltaic awnings. Mounted on the facade are 575 m2 photovoltaic modules generating one fifth of the electricity needs of the factory; 210 m2 modules are in front of the south facing
wall. The angle is assigned to optimize summer sun radiation, and to allow the winter sun to

penetrate into the building. The interior space under the tilted facade is a circulation area.

Figure 7. Transformation of building forms to satisfy technical requirements.

This example, based on engineering thinking, aims to maximize efficiency. Building forms can be lengthened to house more rooms or functional areas. By separating one roof
into louvers, photovoltaic panels can harvest equal solar radiation. The drawback to this solution is that the distance between louvers has to be carefully calculated in order to avoid possible shadow on them. To satisfy this technical requirement, the building's appearance,
layout, and space have to be transformed to suit the changes (see Figure7). These

2.3.2 Form making towards aesthetic and cultural expression

Synthesis of materials and form making towards artistic and cultural expression are architects' challenges. When a new building material is invented, architects will seek ways to integrate it into buildings through form-making, space design, structure, and other

architectural factors. During this process, the new material's artistic expression in building integration will be discovered gradually. This process of design is also happening with the
architectural integration of photovoltaic materials.

challenges are beyond engineers' capacity to solve.

Photovoltaic materials can be integrated into various building forms. First, cubic thinking

is a given for most architects. Mont-Cenis Academy is an example (see Figure 8). This public institution consists of many different functions: college, library, office, hotel, restaurant,

glass that is inserted into an aluminum frame. The glass envelope has an area of 20.000 m2 and produces a climatic buffer zone so that the inside always enjoys a Mediterranean climate.

The summer house in Figure 4 is one example. The facade of this building is completely tilted,
but this leaves many interior spaces hard to use. The gable roof or facade is a traditional

Another successful facade, achieving harmony with other building materials, is shown in Figure 35. Photovoltaic modules are regarded as wall elements like other wood panels, creating harmony in this building. This notion of photovoltaic architecture can become possible if the efficiency and cost are acceptable to clients. When a photovoltaic system is integrated into a building envelope, the price to performance ratio can also be reasonable
(Dehra, 2004).

notion for an architect; the advantage to it is the aesthetic quality of symmetry. However, the
shaded side of the gable roof is usually made with other materials, which gives a sense of

imbalance to the building. To use the interior space better and create an independent effect, another technique is to raise the mono-pitched roof up, leaving more interior spaces for use.
This technique is demonstrated in the Solar Cafeteria built in Germany (see Figure 9). Its

mono-pitched roof holds a recreational space for a cafeteria. This is a prototype of a typical photovoltaic building. The building form is simple. The function of the cafe, demanding little of space or form, can be easily satisfied.

Figure 9. Solarcafe "Sonnenzeit" in Kirchzarten,Germany.

What if the space need is changed or the area needs to be increased? Can this

simple form be used in this situation? Canoga Park Branch Library in Los Angeles provides a good solution, (see Figure 10). This library's space needs are more complex than those of

small residential and service buildings. To house the major function areas, the architects designed a tilted roof supported by a steel grid system. The lecture room, separated from the

major reading area, is a massive cylinder.

This one storey building does not show the

conflict between space arrangement and roof forms.
16
17

One of the aesthetic challenges for a single-pitched roof is the monotony of a large area of deep blue photovoltaic panels. To solve this problem, some tectonic techniques are

applicable.

For instance, a single photovoltaic roof can be transformed into saw tooth roofs.

By doing this, the architect has extended the whole span north-south, providing opportunities
for housing many functional areas. Interior space can be flexible due to the structural system. The side curtain wall offers great daylight (see Figure 12).
Figure 10. Canoga Park Branch Library in Los Angles.

'

Can mono-pitched photovoltaic roofs be used in multifamily buildings and

communities? A possible approach to relieving the dull sense that mono-pitched roofs bring is to employ the principle of rhythm, for instance, designing even multi-unit communities in which the tilted roofs can be arranged in rows. In the case of the Solarsiedlung project (see
Figure 11), maximizing solar gain was the primary goal, but by separating solar roofs into

several similar forms in the principle of rhythm, architect Rolf Disch also created a successful
harmony.

Figure 12. San Diego Children's Museum, photos showing multiple pitched roofs integrated with
photovoltaic and interior space.

Saw tooth roofs can also be integrated into other irregular forms, such as oval

shapes. The office building of Flora Exhibition International in Shenzhen China (see Figure

13) is oval shaped with a photovoltaic roof. This is an example of how creative design of
multiply pitched roofs becomes possible. However, a new problem presented by this building is that the oval shape cannot satisfy both optimum solar radiation and other architectural issues such as interior space and natural ventilation. In this case, the long axis of oval is

useful for arranging photovoltaic panels, but not for conducting the south east wind in the
summer.

One aspect that clients and architects for the Oldenburg stadium had to consider is the conflict between constant electricity generation and dynamic energy use in stadium buildings. However, this would not be a problem in a country where the government promotes

Approach one: Fixed angles (Turbulence House)

An opportunity for creative design lies in geometrical transformation. As shown on the top diagram of Figure 18, an XY plane representing the photovoltaic roof can conform to any
shape and form underneath without altering the slope angles. This demonstrates that building forms, roof perimeters, and space can be complex.

Turbulence House, designed by Steven Holl's studio for an artist couple Richard Tuttle and Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge, is an example of the approach to photovoltaic integration.
The Berssenbrugges hoped to construct "a 'green' self-sustaining building," (Giovannini,2003, 138-144). To response this, Steven Holl proposed a two-storey house, 900 square foot house with prefabricated aluminum cladding. This house, inspired by an iceberg, has a guest room

and study area situated on the second floor. Steven Holl convinced his client that integrating
photovoltaic technology with an organic form need not lose the function of the building; more than that, the building he designed generated a style with an unforgettable sense of space (see Figure 19, Figure 20).

Figure 20. The tilted roof of Turbulence House covered by thin snow.

Figure 19. Turbulence house, designed by Steven Holl. The tilted roof is mounted with photovoltaic
panels to optimize solar gain. The second floor houses a bedroom and a study area.

There are long hours of solar radiation annually in New Mexico where this house situates. " The average number of hours of annual sunshine ranges from near 3,700 in the southwest

to 2,800 in the north-central portions " (Western Regional Climate Center, 2008, p.1 ). Due to this, the initial photovoltaic roof panels can generate enough electricity to power the whole guest house. Additional PV panels can produce up to 3.3 kw-hr/ day for this couple's own adobe house that not far from this house. The radiant floor heating system is also powered by
26 27

the roof PV cells (Nakata, 2006, pp. 45-53). The wind is moderate and there is little precipitation in that area. However, the snow, from 3 to 100 inches, might be a problem for this photovoltaic roof in winter (Western Regional Climate Center, 2008). This building form has a strong relation to technology, context, and the architect's intent.
For instance, the roof slope is suitable for optimizing electricity generation. The desire to produce a sustainable building merges appropriately with its geographical context. In addition, Turbulence House demonstrates that complex building forms and space can be realized by using elastic materials such as aluminum, steel, and polymer.

Approach two: tracing system (Heliotrop)
Figure 21. Heliotrop and its perspective, designed by Rolf Disch.

By rotating cylinder- formed buildings, the photovoltaic roofs potential for energy generation will be maximized. Rolf Disch, a German architect, has promoted the idea of rotating houses with Heliotrop (see Figure 21). Photovoltaic and thermal collectors are
mounted on the roof and perimeter of its cylindrical form. This house can rotate along its central vertical axis to maximize solar gain.

Approach three: flowing forms (Steinhude Sea Recreation Facility)

Flowing forms, containing surfaces with various angles, are one of the approaches to

achieve this kind of satisfaction in architectural design. Geometrically, by shifting the XY

consumption and energy generation. One aspect for concern is that the extra electricity gained through this approach is only about 10% in a two direction tracking system and less than 20% in a three direction tracking system. On the other hand, the investment in the mechanical system could be several times higher than the extra electricity gained from the tracking system. Another aspect for concern is that these revolving buildings are not suitable for large scale building for mechanical reasons. The larger a building is, the more energy and the larger mechanism for rotating the building will be needed.

Architect Randall Stout brought this idea to photovoltaic technology. In the small Steinhude Sea Recreation Facility in Germany, he challenged the nature of photovoltaic cells against

the nature of contemporary architecture (see Figure 22). This building's flowing form, derived from his schematic idea of eels, could provide opportunities for creative architectural design

Any new material experiences a long process of being adapted into buildings and structures. Plastic, for example, has been adopted into buildings for decades.

What they have done proves that plastic forms, from folded-plate to dome structures, from shells to

2.4.3 Expression of Particular Cultures (The Japanese Sanyo Solar Ark)

To express particular cultures, architects can turn to study connections among themes in this culture and society. For example, different accessories might be culturally linked to different levels of social status. The Sanyo Solar Ark is an example of such a way of expressing the rich Japanese culture and spirit (see Figure 27). The form of the Japanese Solar Ark building imitates the form of the Japanese traditional sword or archway. Japanese

swords have a long history in which their shapes have changed many times. However, many

styles of antique Japanese sword have an arc shaped scabbard and handle (see Figure 28).
Different forms of sword also identified the owners. Hoso tachi, one style of Japanese sword,

could be worn only by the highest ranking royal officers in ancient Japan. Thus this shape of
sword can evoke cultural memories of nobility and elegance. By integrating this unique shape

into the building, the architects successfully expressed a cultural meaning through this solar

building (see Figure 29). The purity of the whole building's coloured envelope, in harmony
with the unique colour of the solar panels, also conveys the Japanese spirit through the
colour of the Japanese traditional archway and Zen Garden.

2.4.4 General Social Beliefs (The Canadian Museum for Human Rights)

More general social beliefs can also be expressed in photovoltaic buildings. The Canadian Museum for Human Rights, planned to be completed in 2012, is an example. This museum designed by Antoine Predock proposes to " feature, explore and promote discussion on human rights legislation such as the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and other human rights legislation " (CMHR Commission, 2008).

Conveying the notion of human rights in architecture challenged Predock who has

responded by using " shingled glass to wrap several stone galleries (see Figure 30).

The

glass panels, embedded with photovoltaic cells, represent "cloud" which is one of three
symbolic elements in his design" ( Pearson, 2006, p. 194). These clouds, as Predock

explains, are curved surfaces in architectural geometries. This building's forms evoke the
sense of faith, embrace, and protection (see Figure 31).

Some architects intent to achieve aesthetic pleasures in architectural design rather than concerning issues like building performance, maintenance and daily operation. However, these issues largely influence people's satisfaction towards buildings. The main problems architects will face in the process of integrating photovoltaic buildings can be categorized into three groups: electrical performance, technical, and architectonic aspects.

advantage of solar potential power output before they start a conceptual design.
If maximizing electricity output is not the priority, integrating photovoltaic systems into

the facade provides more opportunities for architectural design. Take Lux Nova, designed by Canadian stained glass artist Sarah Hall, for example. This wind tower delivers a dream-like beauty from every photovoltaic cell laminated in its transparent facade (see Figure 34).

surfaces. First, different geographical locations influence the annual electricity output of
photovoltaic panels in buildings. Figure 32 shows the relationship between geographical

location and electricity output of photovoltaic materials. The closer to the equator, the lower
the photovoltaic panels' slope angles are.

Second, electricity generated by photovoltaic panels in a given geographical location

is determined mainly by two factors: slope and azimuth angle. To illustrate the major factors influencing the architectural integration of photovoltaic panels, a diagram (see Figure 33) is
drawn to show how much annual electricity a given type of solar panel can generate in different spatial positions at a specified site in Toronto. This diagram is based on the data of Mila Aleksic, an undergraduate student working for Solar Decathlon 2009. This module type

for reference is Sharp NT-185u1 (1575 x 826 x 46 mm) with14.22% efficiency.

The PV

energy absorption rate is 100%, and a 72KW inverter with 100% efficiency is used. Assume that 0% miscellaneous losses happen in the photovoltaic system. All the data is calculated by
the software RETScreen Version 4.

Every square represents a unique spatial location with a different slope and azimuth angle (no scale). The spectrum from deep red to deep blue represents the power the solar panel generates annually. The deeper red the square, the more power the solar panel in that position will generate. The deeper blue the square, the smaller the amount of electricity the solar panel in that position will generate. The optimized slope is 33 degrees with azimuth 90 40

2.5.2 Technical and architectonic implications

If architects manage to integrate cultural meaning into photovoltaic buildings, then

what other issues besides electrical performance can affect the form making of photovoltaic

buildings? What potential risks will architects face in creative architectural design? The
questions at hand provoke detailed discussions on technical and architectonic aspects in
creative design and practice.

First, the clients' expectations are the priority in architectural integration of
photovoltaic technologies. For instance, the clients' expectations for Turbulence House were

not colour and transparency, but conversion efficiency of photovoltaic panels. In this case photovoltaic panels are a minor part of the building visually. Furthermore, the tiled roof of the Turbulence House provides an effective solution for the clients by achieving uniformity in both
form-making and photovoltaic performance.

Second, clients' expectations imply that architects need to concern availability, accessibility and perceptibility of building surfaces for photovoltaic material. When architects seek suitable parts of building envelopes for photovoltaic materials in conceptual design; availability of building surfaces including the size, consistence and orientation should be

systematically considered. For instance, rigid, opaque and dull crystalline silicon materials

are suitable for metal roofing systems. Comparably, flexible, semi-transparent and colourful
thin film materials have the potential to be integrated with skylight, facade, and windows.

One primary challenge in the rooftop renovation at London City Hall is to seek enough area for photovoltaic modules (see Figure 17). The building was designed as a passive solar

building as architects didn't expect to add new components to the rooftop. Consequently, the
photovoltaic rooftop of the oval building tiling facing north brings difficulty for the optimization
of electrical performance.

Accessibility of building surfaces for photovoltaic material refers to the idea that

photovoltaic panels integrated into buildings should be easily accessible for cleaning and maintenance. Lack of proper consideration for accessibility degrades photovoltaic

performance. For example, the large tiled photovoltaic roofs in Solarsiedlung community
(Figure 9) post a problem of accessibility. The affordable design, due to its standardized photovoltaic arrays, expose fragile, slippery and inaccessible glass roofs presenting considerable difficulties for cleaning and maintenance. The major implication for accessible
photovoltaic roofs is that structural supports for photovoltaic modules need to be simple, durable and sturdy.

German solar company stromaufwarts, do not perform major insulating functions so the
facade still requires insulating layers. Roof integrated photovoltaic modules also raise
questions about seeking additional layers for insulation and moisture protection. For instance,

the idea of a photovoltaic roof challenges various architectural performances such as thermal comfort, lighting and insulation in Mont-Cenis-Academy. The academy's envelope was
designed as a transparent "shell" resistant to solar radiation, rain, and wind. On the rooftop photovoltaic panels perform only few functions of a conventional roof. Architects had to

and texture should be carefully considered in a rational manner. Spinnereistrasse in
Vorarlberg, Austria is an example of inspiring architectural composition in photovoltaic buildings (see Figure 35). Visible dark blue photovoltaic modules are regarded as facade panels that seek equilibrium and harmony with other building components. In addition, the

Fourthly, complex photovoltaic systems may generate difficulties in construction, maintenance and electric performance therefore increasing initial costs. The inconsistent arrangement of photovoltaic panels generates difficulties in technical integration. For architectural form-making different convex slopes occurring along a short length can cause difficulties in photovoltaic integration. Responding to these technical limitations, Steinhude Sea Recreation Facility has relatively gentle slopes when integrating convex surfaces with rigid photovoltaic modules. In addition, using standard photovoltaic modules will reduce
complexity and installation costs.

notion of photovoltaic architecture is feasible because the price to performance ratio is satisfying (Himanshu, 2004).

Finally, the awareness about building surfaces triggers a further discussion on suitable building types for photovoltaic materials (see Table 2). Table 2 analyzes the potential for photovoltaic materials integrated into various building types. Different building types
supply possible building surfaces with various spatial positions while at the same time providing architects with the potential to express cultural and artistic motifs. For instance, a

institutional buildings also have potentials to integrate photovoltaic materials. Generally, some owners of commercial buildings in urban area are selective about their exterior because they worry that shoppers dwindle due to the dark frontage integrated with photovoltaic panels. However, an imaginative design will challenge negative views about solar materials. The roofs or canopies of commercial buildings are potential surface areas for
photovoltaic integration. Compared to commercial buildings, industrial buildings provide

choice of locations in a particular urban context.

Residential buildings are a major market for photovoltaic technologies. Due to their large number, the economic and environmental impact of photovoltaic integration of

residential buildings would be significant. This energy strategy would stimulate the
development of solar energy technologies. Currently, the main market for photovoltaic technologies is small scale residential buildings such as houses, townhouses and mid-rise apartments. Architecturally, the traditional prototype of a house with tilted roofs benefits photovoltaic technologies, and the facade of residential buildings also offers areas for photovoltaic integration. However, maximizing daylight in residential buildings limits the

designers with more exterior surface for photovoltaic integration. High efficiency and good performance are the two priorities in photovoltaic integration of industrial buildings. As a result, the panels should be installed on the roof, which reduces the design opportunities to
showcase photovoltaic technologies to the public.

The basic requirement for photovoltaic integration is that there is no shading in the site. Based on this principle, agricultural areas are a natural fit for photovoltaic technologies,
except that this would consume valuable land areas. Urban areas without shading are also appropriate for photovoltaic integration. Urban

their function changes over the years. In many post-industrial cities, old industrial low-rise buildings that have been changing their functions would be appropriate sites for photovoltaic integration.

based on the research presented in this thesis. The project, titled a Recreational Facility

Integrated with Photovoltaic Technologies, presents form exploration and architectural
intervention. The application of the research is understood through the process of this design. The intention is to present: First, the importance of interaction between building forms and photovoltaic materials in conceptual design. Second, how the architectural theme is conveyed. Thirdly, how relevant details of the building can be sophistically developed to
achieve an efficient solution.

To find a meaningful project for photovoltaic technologies three major aspects must be considered including topographical, economic and social feasibility. Topographical feasibility emphasizes the solar analysis of the site which helps to determine the appropriate

area for the proposed building during a year. Economic feasibility refers to the comparison of
energy generation and consumption of the proposed building while questions like whether the

energy generation is significant compared with the energy consumption of the building have
to be framed to judge the proposed project. Social feasibility is assessed and determined through investigating demographics of local communities and public demands on building space. This step-by-step logic and reasoning is the basis and criteria for the design project.

Based on the three aspects, the author selected Lamport Stadium Recreational Park - one of numerous green spaces in Toronto - as the proposed site. This site contains an aged stadium, a green space and various municipal parking lots. The major topographical

character of the neighbourhood is the flatness of urban fabric consisting of low rise office
buildings and industrial parks (see Figure 37, 38). There are around 20 conifers and other

deciduous trees five to 12 metres tall mainly distributed along the west and east edges of the
site. An historic house is located on the northwest corner on the King Street W. The economic

urban environment.

rain collection, patio and expressive structure into a cubic form. The architectural theme is to express the shape of energy flow, the weightlessness of a photovoltaic roof and the dynamic
photovoltaic facade.

Information of the proposed site was obtained and gathered following several site trips

Historically this area was used for prisons followed by a major industrial centre (Wieditz, 2007). After urbanization in recent decades, the neighbourhoods were gradually transformed into an art centre accommodating various industries related to arts such as furniture design (Green design studio), radio (Sirius), and 3D film (Geneva Film Co).

employment and distinctive landscape drove young professionals to move into this area
therefore promoting local economic activity and recreational opportunities. As a public green

space the existing Lamport Stadium Park fails to service new residents in the area. These
social and geographical factors, combining with solar shading analysis, make the proposed

site an ideal place for proposing a new recreational facility integrated with photovoltaic
technologies.

Objectives and building programs presented in this section address the technical and

architectural challenges of photovoltaic integration with building forms to maximize electricity
generation. These challenges are constructed based on the research and investigation of the site. Form exploration examines the objectives and building programs determined in the previous process. The research presented in Section One guides form exploration with criteria such as electricity generation, urban context, structure, flexibility for various technologies and building programs.

An explicit form model generated in the previous step has to be integrated with an
architectural theme to develop an elaborate design. In the process of architectural intervention the author integrated aspects such as expressive ideas, thermal insulation, structure, solar control, dimension, proportion, scale, details of the building, mechanical systems and electronic systems as a whole. This process, depending largely on individual imagination and experience, would lead to various designs. For example, the proposed design project concentrates on the idea of integrating photovoltaic technologies with daylight,

Shading analysis is an essential phase for solar building design. During the conceptual phase architects can use simulation tools such as Sketchup or Ecotech to generate a diagram showing the area available for photovoltaic materials. The process helps determine
the appropriate area for proposed buildings. In this process, the adjacent buildings vegetation,

limited due to the considerable height of the adjacent buildings or vegetation. Finding an
appropriate site for the photovoltaic integration in urban areas becomes important. The diagrams in Figure 39 illustrates that the proposed site is a good fit for photovoltaic

integration because most parts of it are annually free from shades of adjacent low rise buildings. In addition, only the perimeter of the site would be shaded from large conifers and other deciduous plants that are around five to12 metres tall (see Figure 38 for the site views and Figure 40 for area appropriate for photovoltaic integration). Solar analysis implies three
potential shade-free parts in the chosen area for the photovoltaic integration: close to the

Liberty St. (south), at the centre of the site, or close to King St. W (north).

The intention of the design is to provide local residents with convenience of engaging in

activities and events. A proposed location close to Liberty St. or in the centre of the site will fail to achieve this goal. Another concern of a central location is that the whole site divided
into three small pieces lacks flexibility for hosting large events.

The area appropriate for photovoltaic materials is illustrated in Figure 40. The distance between the perimeters of the suitable area and the adjacent trees is designed at least 1.5

times the height of these trees. Since the adjacent buildings do not cast continuous shade on
the chosen part of the site, sunrise and sunset times in Toronto can be approximately taken as the daytime hours for this design project. Table 4 shows the sunrise and sunset times for

Toronto's Eastern Time Zone in 2009. The data calculated and collected through an online

3.3 Site Analysis

The following figures illustrate the site with information consisting of its urban context, demographic data and community centres in the neighbourhoods. The site is located to the south of King St. W., close to Dufferin St (see Figure 41). The area is experiencing a fast

growing development in which more young professionals are moving in. Young people, a
growing population in local communities, have a strong desire to increase recreational opportunities at the proposed site. However, community centres (see Figure 42) in the neighbourhood are either too small or serve only particular age groups such as high school students. The data from the City of Toronto (see Figure 43) reveals the imbalance between social demands and supply in recent years.

be applicable for photovoltaic materials. Another distinct advantage is the whole built-up structure of a cubic form can be integrated with imaginative motifs on which architecture rests. Beyond these benefits of a cubic form one architectural concern is that a large form has to be grounded in careful building programs.

Based on the previous research, there are potential building forms suitable for the
proposed site. Each concept has advantages and disadvantages.

For the diagonal form A (see Figure 44) a slope for optimizing electricity generation can be achieved by tilting the building facade to a certain degree- 20 to 30 degree in Toronto. The efficiency increased compared with horizontal surface is around 10 percent. However, architects have to solve the difficulties that the diagonal interior space brings and gauge the
higher building costs the diagonal form brings. In many cases diagonal interior space is hard

Snow is one concern to the power output of solar panels in cold regions as Toronto.

The diagonal form A and the vertical form C need low or minimal maintenance of snow because their slopes allow the snow to fall down. Both the waving form B and the cubic form
D, compared to form A and form C, need regular maintenance of snow to stabilize the power
output affected by the snow covering the solar panels.

to use as previous research indicates, especially large scale buildings. Visually, a giant dark
blue building is also like an extraneous object to its context.

One of the objectives in the design project is to maximize solar generation. To achieve this goal, the potential power output each form generates should be examined. The following

For waving forms B (see in Figure 44) a better visual effect is achieved easier than

diagonal forms. It reduces the shadows cast by the building on the street and the potential height of the building. One of the major disadvantages is that less than half of the roofs surface faces the sun making less available for flat photovoltaic materials. In addition, the

Figure 45, Figure 46, Figure 47, and Figure 48 illustrates the process that an architectural idea is integrated with the cubic form and develops into a building.
Service block Flexible space for community use

Photovoltaic canopy

Outdoor space can be used as multifunctional fields that hold many sports activities (see Figure 49). For interior space, only the service block is proposed to be air conditioned to minimize energy use. The fluid interior space, shaped by steel tube structural components, develops a structural theme to explore the design opportunities that rest upon the cubic form.

A proposed service block consists of essential space for the requirements of building property management, public washrooms, storages, multifunctional rooms and a fitness centre (see Figure 50, Figure 51). Multifunctional rooms are located close to King St. W. to benefit circulation. A shipping and receiving area is designed close to the northwest entrance, allowing easy transformation from multifunctional rooms to storage space in the future. The

The south part of the service block contains a mechanical room, an electrical room, a communication room and a fitness centre for local residents. Some retractable seats can be placed against the wall of the service block (see Figure 52). During community events like a
basketball or indoor soccer game, these seats can be drawn out allowing spectators to enjoy the game. When the square needs to be converted into a market, these seats can be retracted to give additional space. The rooftop of the service block, linked by the spiral stair

The idea to design a steel framework (see Figure 53) is driven by the facts that the average lifespan of photovoltaic technologies is less than that of the building and that the
forms of photovoltaic materials are diverse. Generally, most manufacturers guarantee their

photovoltaic materials for 15 to 25 years while steel buildings can last more than 50 years. For future photovoltaic materials with different requirements a cubic framework provides more possibilities than the diagonal or waving form.

The last one is opaque tubular photovoltaic material (see Figure 55). The advantage

of this material is its fine design for flat surfaces and certain climates. This type of material

needs lightweight hook-like supporters while all the tubes are laid on the supporters. The
gaps between tubular materials are good for ventilation and waterproofing. In addition, these

There are four typical photovoltaic materials and technologies proposed in the project. The first is an opaque thin film panel, First Solar FS-270, 1200 x 600 x 6.8mm, 70 W
(see Figure 54). This thin film module is becoming a major player in the future of the

photovoltaic market. The dimensions of this module usually range from 1000 to 2000 mm
depending on the manufacturers. A proper installation needs extra structural supports like clips and framing anchors to fasten flat panels onto the corrugated metal sheet of the roof. In most cases manufacturers provide fundamental hinges to join adjacent flat panels for even surfaces. The design provides an even surface for flat opaque panels like FS-270. Panels

have to be raised up a certain distance from the roof metal sheet for ventilation and drainage.

The second one (see Figure 54) is a typical mono-crystalline photovoltaic cell. This material dominates the photovoltaic market. The reason to choose this material is that when these cells are integrated into a flat glazing roof, many design opportunities exist for skylight and space underneath the roof. As the research reveals, considerable patterns of these cells

are applicable for this roof. One concern is that once the corrugated metal sheet is replaced by this type of sealed translucent roof, the new roof has to take on a waterproofing function that will increase difficulties of maintaining photovoltaic panels.

The third one (see Figure 55) is a thin film, opaque, flexible sheet that is also an

emergent product type. The flat roof can also satisfy the installation requirements of this
photovoltaic module. The reason to choose this material is its considerably low installation cost compared to other photovoltaic materials. It is easy and quick to install and usually only requires small fasteners to fix onto the roof. However, the dimension of this material is large

than that of other photovoltaic materials due to its low efficiency. For instance, SI-M2 288,

Principles and conclusions

4.1

Principles for the building forms integrated with photovoltaic materials The research and the design project revealed four general principles that influence

the design of buildings integrated with photovoltaic materials. The principles discussed in this section are applicable to most photovoltaic integration in northern hemispheres. Generally, photovoltaic materials can be installed or integrated with various building surfaces including

flat roofs, sloped roofs, free form roofs and exterior walls. The type of photovoltaic material is
significant to the design process, affecting the form making, architectural ideas and detail
design of photovoltaic integration.

For large scale photovoltaic integrations, accessibility, flexibility and separation from S structure are critical in the design processes. These three criteria affect installation details

and other design decisions. For small scale photovoltaic integration form making and building
geometries vary. Understanding the general principles of photovoltaic integration helps to

Solar modules installed on the roof are more efficient and economical than solar tiles.
However additional racks of framework must be built to accommodate the solar modules. Efficiency and performance is reduced in the summer when solar tiles are used on the roof
because there is no air convection.

In cold climates, an enclosed interior space provides occupants with more opportunities of
activities than an open structure.

A steel structure is an important option for large scale photovoltaic integration where

large spans are needed. The steel truss system, ranging from 20 metres to more than 100

functions, such as moisture protection, thermal insulation and noise protection. If a tilted
circular roof integrated with photovoltaic materials is visible to the public, the margin between photovoltaic array and the roof edges produces a visual concern. Flexible thin film photovoltaic materials are usually not designed to take on as much static load as roofs do; therefore a supporting structure is needed if flexible thin film sheets are installed on the
building roof.

A sealed roof surface with appropriate photovoltaic panels is preferable if waterproofing function has to be considered in the design. This may result in a thicker roof layering and higher construction cost because a sealed roof needs to bear dynamic and static loads. If an independent canopy is integrated with photovoltaic panels, the roof can be designed into a saw tooth roof to increase performance of photovoltaic panels. If a

If opaque photovoltaic panels replace conventional building facades, then insulation layers should be considered. This is especially important in colder climates. If translucent
photovoltaic panels (amorphous panels, solar cells or other micro photovoltaic cells) replace one part of the building fagade, then the built-form will take on a dark glaze-like appearance. Designers should select other building components to balance the appearance of
photovoltaic materials.

large-scale building roof is integrated with flat photovoltaic panels, better air convection will
improve the performance of the materials in the winter.

If a large structural glazing is integrated with photovoltaic cells, a suitable glazing

structure such as a truss system should be considered because the glass panes integrated with the photovoltaic modules are thicker than normal glazing fagade. If the design objective
is to achieve high performance of photovoltaic panels, then designing a semi-transparent

photovoltaic fagade will not achieve this goal because of its low efficiency. In addition, fagade

integration costs twice as much as roof integration.

Building programs and functions take priority over photovoltaic materials to create building structures. It is important that the structure should be designed to accommodate the
building programs first.

If it is difficult to transform a building form into a diagonal form or free form, then a cubic form with a flat roof may be an alternative. The structure of a flat roof is simpler as compared with other forms, which reduces the construction and electrical costs. If solar

modules are designed with functions such as acoustic protection, thermo-protection and

Because of limited information collected and analyzed in this thesis, only major

photovoltaic materials and technologies such as flat photovoltaic panel, tubular thin film
collectors and flexible thin film panels are included. New photovoltaic technologies like semi-spherical materials, due to their experimental stages, are not included in the research.

materials has not been explored thoroughly. Whether building types influence building

surfaces applicable to photovoltaic materials remains unclear.
