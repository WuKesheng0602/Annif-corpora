DEVELOPMENT OF PERSONALIZED ONLINE SYSTEMS FOR WEB SEARCH, RECOMMENDATION, AND E-COMMERCE By Hao Wen Mechanical Engineering, Ryerson University, 2011

Abstract Personalized online systems for Web search, news recommendation, and e-commerce, are developed. The process of personalization of online systems consists of three main steps: determining a user's needs, classifying products or services, and matching the user's needs with suitable products or services. A multi-feature based method to automatically classify Web pages into categories of topics hierarchically representing the Web pages is proposed. An approach to modeling and quantifying a user's interests and preferences using the user's Web navigational data is presented. The approach is based on the premise that frequently visiting certain types of content or Web sites indicates that the user is interested in related content or retrieving information from those sites. A personalized search system utilizing a Web user's interest, preference and search context models is developed. A Web user's interest and preference models are constructed and updated by analyzing the user's navigational data and automatically classifying Web pages. A user's search context model is used to determine how the user's interest and preference models impact his or her search behavior. An algorithm to re-rank search results generated by a conventional search engine is designed to provide a personalized Web search service. A hybrid recommender system for personalized recommendation of news on the Web is developed. Based on the similarities between Web pages and users' models of interest and preference, the Web pages are recommended to the users who are likely interested in the related topics. Moreover, the technique of collaborative filtering is employed, which aims to choose the trusted users and incorporate machine intelligence combined with human efforts. Once trusted users are determined, their behavior on the Web is considered as the manual recommendation part of the system. A method of classifying Web customers for planning customized emarketing is proposed. The proposed e-marketing approach can be divided into four steps: determining a customer's general interest model, ascertaining a customer's local browsing model, classifying Web customers, and designing a personalized marketing and promotion plan for e-commerce based on the customer classification. Various experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches and systems.

Chapter 1 Introduction

1.1 Background
The Internet is a global system consisting of a vast number of interconnected computer networks all over the world. It connects computers located in government organizations, schools, libraries, corporations, and homes through wired or wireless communications based on the Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Due to many conveniences offered by the Internet, affordable computer devices and internet access, there are billions of users and personal computers connected to the Internet, and are constantly growing. Canada's National Statistical Agency reported that "In 2009, 80% of Canadians aged 16 and older, or 21.7 million people, used the Internet for personal reasons, up from 73% in 2007 when the survey was last conducted" (Statistics Canada, 2010). By using the Internet, individuals can obtain news, send electronic mail, make audio and/or video calls, conduct distance learning, play games with people around the world, etc. It can be affirmed that the Internet has become an indispensable tool for the daily lives of people. Specifically, people rely on the wide variety of services that adhere

1

to the Internet. In this dissertation, any application service that requires data transfer between clients through the Web is defined as an online service. Due to the Web market demands and rapid progress of software and network technologies, a significant number of online services have been developed and are widely used, including email, Web search engines, news distribution system, wiki systems, elibraries, blog sites, e-bank Web sites, e-shopping Web sites, e-marketing systems, emuseum, and entertainment system. The nearly infinite amount of information and a large number of online services bring a digital lifestyle in which the Internet is helpful for people to satisfy their daily and working needs. However, everything has two sides. Because of the large amount of Web information and the individual diversity, a uniform interface and way of offering service will inevitably reduce some individuals' experiences of using the online services. With the explosive growth of the Internet and the rapidly increasing number of internet users, the personalization of online services of both academia and industry have been paying much more attention to the proficient skills and navigational needs of users. Eirinaki and Vazirgiznnis (2003) define Web personalization as the process of customizing a Web site to the needs of specific users. They emphasize that a personalized Web site can take advantage of knowledge obtained from the analysis of a user's navigational behavior/data in correlation with the collected Web information such as the Web structure and content. This research expands the definition of Web personalization to all types of online services. A personalized online service is a targeted service that can provide a specific interface and/or result data to an individual or a group 2

of Web users based on the matching of available data sets and the collected profile of the users. The importance of the personalization of online services can be observed through a few cases. Case 1: For a certain query, a conventional search engine provides the same search result to all users, regardless of different profiles and different interests of users. For example, when a user searches for "apple" using a conventional search engine, the search engine may provide the information of Apple Company on the top of the list, since it does not know whether the user is asking for the information of the apple fruit or the Apple Company. Therefore, the effectiveness of such search engines can be improved by integrating a user's model of interests/needs into the ranking process. Case 2: As a repository of news and information, the Web has some inherent advantages over other forms of media, such as newspaper, radio, and television. The most significant advantage of distributing news on the Web itself is the infinite expandability of the Web. However, a news Web site can offer a large amount of daily news and information that exceeds a user's ability to consume it. At a traditional news Web site, a user may browse through it and filter out the uninterested items, which is time-consuming and tedious. For this reason, it is necessary and practical to develop a personalized news recommendation system that is based on a user's interests and preferences. Case 3: Since the 1990s, e-business and e-commerce models have been implemented by many companies, for instance, AmazonTM, Apple iTunesTM store, and eBayTM. In order to make profit efficiently, an effective e-marketing strategy is required 3

by internet shops. Although many e-marketing strategies such as recommending bestselling items, random recommendation, and presenting similar items are available, the emarketing strategy of recommending the items based on a user's desires is obviously the most effective way if the user's models can be accurately constructed. From these cases, it can be seen that online service providers are challenged by how to effectively satisfy the various needs of different users. Traditional online services usually leave the process of refinement to users, which means users may spend time on searching for the relevant results themselves. In order to relieve users from tediously searching massive data sets, approaches to personalized online services attempt to intelligently find out the relevant results for each user/group-user according to user profiles. In other words, the personalization of online services is one of the solutions to improve the performance of information systems. Today, through the work of different researchers, many methods and techniques regarding Web personalization have been developed (Yong et al., 2005; Stamou and Ntoulas, 2009; Wen et al., 2010). Because of the variety of online services, different types of personalization systems may have different goals, data sets, user sets, etc. For example, a personalized Web search engine aims to rank Web pages based on a user's information needs, while a personalized online shop is supposed to recommend to a user certain items that the user may purchase. These two types of online services have different goals: to satisfy user's information needs and to sell products; different data sets: Web pages and products; and different user sets: information diggers and potential 4

customers. Thus, the approaches to personalization may be apparently varied in different online service systems. However, from the perspective of research, personalization systems are more or less connected since they have three common elements: human, content, and a matching process (Liu et al., 2004; Ardissono et al., 2005; Wei et al., 2005; Teevan et al., 2010). In other words, most personalization systems need to face the challenges of effectively distinguishing users, classifying contents, and matching content with user profiles. Therefore, research on Web personalization covers a broad range of topics, such as user modeling, content based classification, collaborative filtering (CF), and system integration. The topic of user modeling always occupies an important position in Web personalization because one of the prerequisites of conducting Web personalization is to determine a user's specific needs. In terms of the way to construct user models, it can be divided into two types: the explicit method and the implicit method. With an explicit user modeling method, a user's profile is structured directly from survey data or other user information. The advantages of explicit user modeling are a low computational cost and high accuracy method, while the disadvantages are dependency on user effort and limited scalability. Contrarily, a system of implicit user modeling can build a user's models without or with little participation from the user. The process of implicit user modeling is usually based on the analysis of a user's normal navigational data, instead of intentional enquiry. For example, Ng et al. (2007) presented a method to learn a user's preference by analyzing the user's click-through data on a search engine. Currently, the technique of 5

implicit user modeling has been widely used in many personalized systems, which implies the practicality of the implicit modeling method. Nevertheless, these personalized systems do not share a uniform model of constructing a user profile. This research involves applying a method of implicit user modeling to different types of online services. A user's generally navigational data is used to construct a user's interest and preference models. By investigating the similarity between a user's models and available contents provided by the online services, the contents which are likely to satisfy the user's needs are presented to the user.

1.2 Objectives of the Research
The overall objective of this research is to provide a solution to the personalization of various online services. The proposed solution is based on the technique of user modeling and the integration of user models and online services such as Web search engines, Web news recommendation systems, and e-marketing systems. A user's interest and preference models are constructed by analyzing the user's navigational data. Three different types of personalized online services are developed by combining the user's models and the traditional online services. There are several sub-objectives of this research:

6

1. To develop a Web page classification method for analyzing a user's viewed Web pages. Using the proposed classification method, Web pages can be grouped into categories based on topics. 2. To design a system of user modeling that is used to identify a user's interests and preferences. A user's navigational data is tracked and analyzed by the proposed Web page classification system. A user's models of interests and preferences are constructed based on the statistics of the viewed items. 3. To develop a personalized Web search engine based on the proposed user modeling method. The proposed personalized search engine can re-rank the Web pages obtained by a conventional search engine according to a user's interest model. 4. To construct a personalized Web news recommendation system. News pages are classified using the proposed method of Web page classification. Based on the similarity between a news page and a user's models of interest and preference, the system will determine whether the news page is recommended to the user. 5. To propose an architecture of a personalized e-marketing system. In the system, a content-based filtering method is used to generate a personalized e-marketing strategy. As mentioned above, this is related to several research fields, such as text information classification, user modeling, personalization, Web search engines, recommendation systems, and e-marketing systems. Figure 1.1 shows the overall architecture of this research. There are four components in the proposed architecture of 7

personalization system: Web page classification, user modeling, online services, and personalized online services.

In the proposed architecture, a user's navigational data is tracked by the system as the raw data to model the user. Using the proposed Web page classification method, the viewed Web pages of a user are redirected to related category topics. A user's interest and preference models are constructed and updated by analyzing how often the user views the Web pages of each category. Three types of online services, search engines, news recommenders, and e-marketing systems are associated with this research. Each of them is integrated with the proposed user modeling method to provide a personalized service. The proposed personalized search engine aims to re-rank the search results based on a user's models. The personalized news recommender is developed to offer users the news of their interests. The proposed personalized e-marketing system is expected to present to a user the items that the user would potentially purchase. In the rest of this dissertation, the proposed Web page classification method, the proposed user modeling system, and the personalized systems for search, news recommendation, and e-marketing will be discussed in details.

Chapter 2 Literature Review

As mentioned in Section 1.2, this dissertation is related to several research topics. In this chapter, a literature review is presented which is composed of five components. These five components are: Web page classification, user modeling, personalized Web search, personalized Web news recommender, and personalized e-marketing.

2.1 Web Page Classification
Web page classification can be considered as a specific case of text document classification or clustering. Ever since computers were invented, researchers have paid attention to text document classification. The computer revolution and the rise of the Internet in the 1990s have created a large amount of digital text documents, which have inspired researchers to develop a number of approaches to text document classification (Wang and Chiang, 2007; Isa et al., 2009; Lan et al., 2009).

11

The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) is a proprietary system of library classification developed by Melvil Dewey in 1876 (Scott, 2005). It has also been widely used in digital book classification with some revisions. The DDC attempts to organize all knowledge into ten main classes. The ten main classes are each further subdivided into ten divisions, and each division into ten sections, giving ten main classes, 100 divisions and 1000 sections. DDC's advantage in using decimals for its categories allows it to be both purely numerical and hierarchical. Yu and Xu (2008) experimentally compared the performances of blocking spam emails using four machine learning algorithms. The terms in an email are extracted and compared with certain, frequently used words that typically appear in spam emails. Depending on an appropriate threshold of similarity, an incoming email can be classified into two categories: accepted or rejected. Kim et al. (2005) proposed a dimension reduction method to reduce the dimension of the document vectors. They also introduced a decision function for the centroid-based classification algorithm and support vector classifiers to handle the classification problem where a document may belong to multiple classes. They concluded that with several dimension reduction methods that are designed particularly for clustered data, higher efficiency for both training and testing could be achieved without sacrificing the accuracy of text classification predictions even when the dimension of the input space is significantly reduced. Aggarwal et al. (2004) discussed the merits of building text categorization systems by using supervised clustering techniques. They claimed that completely unsupervised clustering has the disadvantage of being difficult to sufficiently isolate finegrained classes of documents relating to a coherent subject matter. Therefore, the 12

information from a preexisting taxonomy is utilized to supervise the creation of a set of related clusters. They concluded that with partially supervised clustering it is possible to have some control over the range of subjects that one would like the categorization system to address with a precise mathematical definition of how each category is defined. They also suggested the supervised clustering as a priori knowledge to the definition of each category. Liu et al. (2009) proposed an imbalanced text classification method based on a term weighting approach. They found that categories with fewer examples are under-represented and their classifiers often perform far below satisfactory. They use a simple probability based term weighting scheme in order to better distinguish documents in minor categories. They claimed that the proposed approach using the term weighting method could improve the performance of minor categorization, while not jeopardizing performance for major categorization. Although a number of methods for text document classification have been proposed, they cannot be directly employed to classify Web pages without any modification; because Web pages are semi-structured text documents with their own unique characteristics. For example, a Web page may be too short to be analyzed; a Web page may contain a lot of noise information such as advertisements. Therefore, researchers are trying to find solutions to work on Web page classification more effectively. Among these works, one was presented by Kan and Thi (2005). They use text content features and uniform resource locator (URL) to classify Web pages for school 13

websites. Due to school Web sites having dedicated topics, they only need to categorize the Web pages into a few classes, such as faculty, course, student, and research pages. After using a support vector machine (SVM) based on maximum entropy to define the feature set, the Web pages can be automatically classified into the broad categories. Some previous works have also put efforts on classifying Web pages hierarchically (Choi and Peng, 2004; Yang and Lee, 2004; Koraljka and Marianne, 2009). The work of Yang and Lee (2004) aimed to automatically create Web directories and their structure. They applied a text mining process on a corpus of Web pages to identify some important topics in this corpus. In their approach, a self-organizing map (SOM) neural network is constructed to cluster Web pages. In addition, they applied a recursive process to develop hierarchies of the identified topics and create a hierarchical structure of Web directories. Some researchers applied the concept of ReliefF (Robnik-Sikonja and Kononenko, 2003; Wang and Makedon, 2004) in their automatic classification approaches. Jin et al. (2007) presented the work using ReliefF and hidden Naïve Bayes model for automatic Web pages categorization. Their work focused on finding relevant words for improving Web page classification performance based on ReliefF decision tree. After relevant words having been determined, a hidden parent in the Naïve Bayes structure is created for each word/attribute, which combines the influences from all other words/attributes.

Ru and Horowitz (2007) proposed a framework of classifying Web forms on ecommerce Web sites. In their proposed method, Web forms are identified by scanning for form tags. A neural network based classifier is applied to separate forms into different categories, such as search form and communication form. It can be observed that there is little noise information in such classification approaches. Based on the discussion of related works, it can be found that little work has been carried out on the general Web page classification to topics with abundant noise information. The goal of this research is to attempt to integrate three collaborated classifiers for Web page classification in a noisy Web environment. In this work, the dedicated classifiers based on the directory feature, meta information feature, and Web page content feature are utilized and integrated.

2.2 User Modeling
In personalized online services based on a user's models, the content similarity between the user's profile and the products (Web pages) or services are analyzed and used to provide relevant products that satisfy the user's needs. In many personalized Web systems, a user's profile or model implies the user's attributes of interest and preference. The process of creating a user's profile or models is called user modeling. Different systems may have different structures of user models, since they have their own purposes, interfaces, user groups, etc. For example, a digital library may have a structure 15

of user models consisting of gender, age, and education level, while an online shop needs to model a user's age, location, and purchase interests. In order to collect the user information and create user models/profiles, there are two approaches that are widely used: the explicit approach and the implicit approach. For the purpose of user modeling, an explicit approach is an approach to obtain a user's models/profiles through direct queries or surveys. An email subscription system usually inquires as to the user's topics of interest. This is a typical online service system using the explicit method to create a user's profile. The direct communication between an online service system and its users in the explicit approach can help the system to retrieve a user's accurate information very quickly. However, using the explicit approach to create a user profile has several limitations: the profile cannot update itself when the user's interests and preferences change over time; a user may be tired of answering inquiries during the construction of a profile; any change in the structure of a profile needs the user's participation. Therefore, implicit approaches that are flexible and capable of updating itself have been studied and applied to various personalized online services (Claypool et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2004; Chirita et al., 2005; Frias-Martinez et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2006; Choi and Ahn, 2009; Jiang and Tuzhilin, 2009; Zo and Ramamurthy, 2009; Godoy et al., 2010). Because many users are unwilling to participate in the time-consuming process of constructing user interest and preference models, implicit approaches are increasingly applied in personalized online services to automatically build user models without 16

interrupting Web user's navigation (Liu et al., 2004; Shen et al., 2005; Agichtein, 2006; Radlinski and Joachims, 2007; Teevan et al., 2010). The implicit approach to user modeling is a process to create and update user models by collecting and analyzing user data. A significant difference between explicit and implicit approaches is that implicit approaches need to calculate the collected user data for user modeling, while explicit approaches directly fit the collected user data into user models. Unlike explicit approaches which adopt the category (topic) structure for user profiles, implicit approaches can use either the structure of the category or the structure of bags of words to create user profiles. In the papers by Speretta and Gauch (2005), Ma et al. (2007), and Stamou and Ntoulas (2009), a user's interest and/or preference models are constructed by applying the structure of the category. In order to achieve higher effectiveness and accuracy, a user's interest model is usually hierarchically structured into categories. During a Web user's navigation, the user's navigational data including queries, feedback, and viewed Web pages, is tracked and analyzed by the personalized search system. Therefore, the user's interest model is identified by classifying the user's navigational data into hierarchical categories. In a user's Web search session, the Web pages obtained from traditional search engines are re-ranked based on the similarity between the user's interest model and the resulting Web pages. The bag-of-words model is usually used in document classification, user modeling, natural language processing, and other applications of information retrieval. In the bag-of-words model, a piece of text instead of a set of categories is represented as the 17

description for a target such as a Web user's interests, preferences, images, or video clips. Sugiyama et al. (2004) assumed that a user's preference model consists of two aspects: persistent preferences and ephemeral preferences. Therefore, a user's preference model is constructed by summarizing the user's navigational history including both long-term and short term preferences into a vector of terms. Luxenburger et al. (2008) discussed how to match user task profiles and needs in a personalized Web search. The language model is used to represent a user's task profile, which collects the user's various navigational components such as queries, result clicks, click-stream documents, and queryindependent browsed documents, while user needs are represented by the queries in the current search session. Daoud et al. (2008) studied how to aggregate concept-based shortterm interests to represent a Web user's long-term interest model. Chirita et al. (2006) argue that desktop information is also substantial to build a user's interest model. In their work, both the navigational information and the desktop information of a user were utilized to construct the user's rich model of interests. As discussed above, different Web systems may need different attributes of users to create user profiles. However, many online systems attempt to capture users' interests and preferences in order to provide a better personalized online service. Some researchers have presented their methods of building an implicit user interest model. Qiu and Cho (2006) proposed a framework to investigate the problem of personalizing Web searches based on users' past search histories without involving users' efforts. In their model, a user's interests in Web pages are formalized and correlated with the user's clicks on 18

search results. Then, a refined user interest model is built based on the correlation. Gunduz and Qzsu (2003) also proposed a user interest model for Web page navigation. Their approach relies on the premise that the visiting time of a page is an indicator of the user's interest in that page. They first partitioned user sessions into clusters such that only sessions which represent the similar aggregate interests of users are placed in the same cluster. Then a model-based clustering approach is employed to partition user sessions according to similar amount of time in similar pages. The resulting clusters are used to recommend pages to users that most likely contain the information which is of interest to them at that time. Although many approaches have been proposed, there is a lack of user interest models that can easily be integrated into various online services. This research is motivated by such intent that a user's interest and preference models are developed based on category topics and Web sources that can be utilized by various personalized Web systems. One objective of this dissertation is to develop an approach to model and quantify a user's Web search interests using the user's navigational data. The approach is based on the premise that frequently visiting certain types of content indicates that the user is interested in that content. As a user surfs on a Web page, the meta-information and the content of the Web page are combined to represent the navigational content. A method of classifying Web pages using significant terms and weights is utilized in order to identify the Web page viewed by the user (Wen et al., 2008a). This research employs the Naïve Bayes theory to update a user's interest and preference models. 19

2.3 Personalized Web Search
Since the Internet went public, a significant number of online services have been developed and widely used. Web search engines are the most popular and useful among these. In terms of retrieval method to a database and interface to users, the Web search engines can be grouped into either directory style or query style (Brin and Page, 1998; Capra and Perez-Quinones, 2005). In a typical directory-based Web search engine, the Web sites collected by the search engine are classified hierarchically through analysis of their content. The typical interface of a directory-based Web search engine usually lays out the titles of the top categories. After one or more queries by a Web user, a list of the Web sites attributed to a certain category is presented to the user. As a result of the explosive development of the Internet since the 1990s, directory-based Web search engines have gradually exposed their disadvantages: the massive number of Web sites in each category makes it nearly impossible for users to look through the vast list of Web sites; the required human effort for manual Web page classification and the complexity of automatic Web page classification decrease the efficiency of directory-based Web search engines. In a typical query-based Web search engine, the Web pages collected by crawling software or client submissions are indexed by all terms appearing in the page's title and effective content (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999). When a Web user's request is presented in the form of keywords, a series of Web pages, ranked by the match between the requested keywords and the terms in the Web pages, are presented to the user. 20

Query-based Web search engines have become dominant over the last decade because they have significant advantages over directory-based Web search engines: the algorithms for identifying and matching terms are relatively simpler than creating algorithms for Web page classification; there is only one step from a user's query to the display of some results, which shows the high efficiency of query-based Web search engines in some cases. However, query-based Web search engines have not reached optimal potential because of the diversity of individuals. For example, when a query of "latest sports news" is submitted to a query-based Web search engine, the top Web site presented by the search engine is the same for all users. This ignores the fact that an individual may prefer to retrieve sports news from a certain Web site rather than from others. Therefore, a personalized search engine system is needed to improve the search quality. Research on personalization of Web search engines has been widely carried out, especially after traditional search engines demonstrated their usefulness and commercial value. Various solutions and approaches to the personalization have been presented by researchers, including personalized Web searches based on content analysis and based on an individual's search behavior, search re-ranking based on the hyperlink structure of the Web, and personalized searches based on user groups. In this section, related work on the personalization of Web search engines is presented and discussed. In personalized searches based on a user's content choice, the content similarity between a user's intents and the search results (Web pages) are computed and used to re21

rank Web pages. As discussed in Section 2.2, a user's interests and intents can be estimated using either the explicit or implicit approaches of user modeling. A user's interests can be expressed by hierarchical category topics or bags of words. In addition to the user's content-based information, the user's behavior-based information is usually exploited to construct user models for personalized online services (Shen et al., 2005; Teevan et al., 2010). Among various data sets of the Web user's navigational behaviors, the data vector of a user's query and the data vector of the user's response to resulting the Web pages are often used to generate the user's search behavior model for personalization of Web searches. Tyler and Teevan (2010) utilized large scale query logs to investigate re-finding behavior in Web search. They showed that the re-finding behavior could be exploited as a means to improve the search experience. Shi and Yang (2007) proposed a query extension method based on the vector of the user's query log. In their work on query, a list of related queries is suggested from analysis of the user's previously submitted queries. Many works are also focused on employing a user's clickthrough information in order to personalize Web navigation. Shen et al. (2005) proposed a search-behavior based on a re-ranking method that aims to improve the effectiveness of a single search session. Once a user clicks on a Web page among the search results, the un-clicked Web pages will be re-ranked based on the similarity between the clicked Web page and each un-clicked Web page. Leung et al. (2008) proposed a click-through data based personalized query suggestion system. The proposed system extracts concepts from clicked Web pages, from which the user's search intent can be modeled. Therefore,

22

related query suggestions can be presented by merging the initial query and the user's intent model. Some personalized Web search approaches rely on the search results of an existing search engine. The additional ranking of Web pages is carried out based on the search results given by conventional search engines. Most of those methods reviewed earlier in this section follow this process. However, many other works focus on the direct modification of page ranking algorithms of existing search engine systems. Page et al. (1998) discussed how to compute PageRank for large numbers of pages, and then presented the personalization of PageRank. Although there are many algorithms of ranking Web pages proposed for information retrieval systems (Chan and Chen, 2007; Meiss et al., 2008; Bhatia and Kumar, 2009; Hwang et al., 2010), the algorithm of PageRank is the most broadly adopted among them. Therefore, many methods of Personalized PageRank (PPR) have been proposed in the last decade (e.g. the methods of adjusting the global PageRank algorithm based on an individual's models). Haveliwala (2003) presented a modified PageRank algorithm that computes the topic-sensitive PageRank scores using the context information containing the query terms. Guo et al. (2007) utilized two factors to bias PageRank results for personalization: the length of time that a user spent visiting a page and the frequency that a page was visited. Su et al. (2008) proposed an approach for personalized page ranking by integrating the mining of the user browsing behaviors and PageRank in order to bridge the gap between global search results and local preferences. With respect to the feasibility of PPR, Pathak et al. 23

(2008) discussed how to build indices for real-time PPR and the trade-off between index size, preprocessing time, and query speed. With the rapid development of social Web applications, some strategies that incorporate the commonality of a group of users have also been presented to help with personalized Web search. Using the approach of personalized searches based on user groups, Web users are usually clustered into different groups of varied topics by analysis of their profile data. Some methods have been proposed to achieve personalized Web search by taking into account the similarity of Web users. Smyth (2007) presented a collaborative Web search method that merges the results from a conventional search engine and the community's search knowledge base. Biancalana and Micarelli (2009) proposed a personalized web search approach based on a social tagging service. The social tags are explored by the system for the query expansion of a conventional search engine. Xue et al. (2009) proposed a method of collaborative personalized searches that groups Web users through a cluster-based language model. Personalized searches are carried out based on employing both the group information and the specialties of individuals for global ranking. A personalized web search approach is developed in this research that involves implicit user modeling (user content), behavior based analysis, and rank modification. The purpose of this work is to propose a method that can utilize various aspects of user modeling to improve personalized Web searches.

2.4 Recommender Systems
Recently, significant attention has been paid by both academia and the industry to Webbased recommender algorithms because of their potential for being applied to personalized online services (Adomavicius and Tuzhilin, 2005a). For example, the method of personalized recommendation has been applied to the fields of e-commerce and e-business, which has proven the feasibility of recommendation systems through practical implementation. Among those systems incorporated with the method of personalized recommendation, the online retailer Web site Amazon

(http://www.amazon.com) is a typical recommendation system that successfully utilizes an extensive range of different recommendation methods. The primary objective of a Web-based recommendation system is to alleviate a user's manual effort by automatically filtering the Web products in a large information repository based on the relevance between the user's needs and the products. Therefore, the technique of personalization performs an important role in recommendation systems by addressing the issue that a personalized recommendation can be achieved only if the users are distinguishable. Three techniques of recommendation have been widely studied and utilized; these are the content-based technique, collaborative filtering, and the hybrid technique (Burke, 2002; Herlocker et al., 2004; Konstan, 2004; Yong et al., 2005). These three techniques and their applications are discussed in the following part of this section. A content-based recommendation system brings forth recommendations based on two aspects: a user's preferences derived from either the explicit or implicit methods, and 25

the features associated with the Web products stored in the system. The research on content-based recommendation systems is usually focused on the user-specific classification problem (Santos et al., 2003; Frias-Martinez et al., 2006) and integrating user modeling approaches into recommendation systems (Godoy et al., 2010). Lancieri and Durand (2006) proposed a method to model a Web user's behavior. Their approach focused on the traces of a user's activities and the analysis of Web contents. A comparative analysis of Internet navigation traces, including hyperlinks and keywords, is used to characterize an individual's behavior as the user is accessing the Web. Choi and Ahn (2009) presented a method for identifying a customer's preferences and recommending the most appropriate product. In their proposed recommendation system, analyzing a user's real-time behavior data from his or her Web usage, such as the content being viewed, the placing of online orders, and purchasing products, constructs the user's model. Therefore, a user's preference model is not directly generated by the explicit query from the user, but as a result of the information on the user's usage behavior concerning the products. Liang et al. (2008) adopted a semantic-expansion approach to create a user's profile by analyzing the documents previously read by the user. They concluded that the proposed semantic-expansion approach outperforms the traditional keyword approach in collecting user interests. A number of works are also focused on the systematical integration of user classification and the recommendation method in various fields. The technique of content-based recommendation can be widely integrated into various types of information systems, such as e-commerce, e-libraries, and news 26

distribution systems. Gao and Li (2007) proposed an online intelligence recommendation system for personalized internet shopping. In their proposed system, an interaction method is designed for the system to obtain a user's needs for less frequently-purchased products. Subsequently, fuzzy logic and marketing strategies are used to recommend high potential and suitable promotion products for each individual customer. Weng et al. (2009) designed a recommendation system for movie promotion. In their proposed system, the integrated contextual information is considered as the foundation concept of the multidimensional recommendation model. Online analytical processing (OLAP) is employed in the system to solve the contradicting problems among hierarchy ratings. Wang and Shao (2004) proposed a Hierarchical Bisecting Medoids (HBM) algorithm to cluster users based on time-framed navigation sessions. Thereafter, the time-framed cluster based user modeling is utilized in the proposed e-learning recommendation system. In the last decade, several approaches to news recommendation systems using content-based technique have been presented (Hsieh et al., 2004; Ha, 2006; Lee and Park, 2007; Li et al., 2010). Ha (2006) focused a news recommendation system on the basis of users' preferences, where the user's preference score prioritizes recommended articles according to the relevance between a user's preferences and the articles. Lee and Park (2007) designed a mobile Web news recommendation system (MONERS) that incorporates attributes of news articles and user preferences with regard to category topics. Li et al. (2010) modeled news recommendation systems as a contextual bandit problem.

27

In a recommendation system, if feature extraction and classification of content are available and feasible, content-based filtering can be applied. Collaborative filtering (CF), on the other hand, is usually adopted when the content representation is ambiguous or complicated. Therefore, CF is an approach used to avoid complicated contentclassification for a recommendation system. There are two types of CF: user-based CF and item-based CF. In a user-based CF system (Miller et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2004; Cho et al., 2007; Jiang and Tuzhilin, 2009; Bernstein et al., 2010), a user's rating function is represented as a vector. Then a method of calculating similarity such as the cosine similarity measurement is used to compute similarities between all user pairs. Consequently, the users are able to be grouped by the similarity estimation. The last step of conducting a user-based CF is to determine the recommended products based on the users' common behaviors or preferences within the same user group. Item-based CF has gained popularity and success because of its theoretical and computational simplifications (Cheung et al., 2004; Wei et al., 2005; Bobadilla et al., 2010). For example, Amazon (www.amazon.com) is a commercial recommendation system that utilizes item-based CF in many aspects. In an item-based CF recommendation system, the similarities of products are computed, which is different from the user-based CF recommendation systems. A simplified solution to the item-based CF system is to track a user's navigational behaviors, then products which have a high similarity value to the user's selection of browsing items are recommended.

28

In order to improve the effectiveness and the efficiency of a system, hybrid recommendation systems are motivated by applying both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering in a single framework (Burke, 2002). Therefore, hybrid recommendation systems are usually built based on both user grouping and product classification. Numerous approaches to integrating collaborative filtering and contentbased filtering have been proposed. Ardissono et al. (2005) developed a multi-agent infrastructure for Web-based recommendation systems. In their proposed system, a user can dynamically enable and disable the built-in recommendation engine due to the flexibility of the multi-agent infrastructure. Moreover, the system can suggest information to possibly heterogeneous tourist groups. Choi et al. (2010) proposed a recommendation system that utilizes the nearest and farthest neighbors of a target customer to yield a reduced dataset of useful information in order to avoid scalability and sparseness problems when confronted by tremendous volumes of data. Recently, much attention has been paid to the safety and privacy issues of recommendation systems (Hurley et al., 2007; Mobasher et al., 2007). Mobasher et al. (2007) investigated the safety issues of user-based, item-based, and hybrid recommendation systems. They concluded that both user-based and item-based algorithms are highly vulnerable to specific attack models, while the hybrid algorithms may provide a higher degree of robustness. A Web-based hybrid news recommender system that can combine the advantages of both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering is developed in this work. The 29

proposed recommender system utilizes the techniques of Web page classification, implicit user modeling, content-based filtering, and collaborative filtering. The goal of the proposed system is to provide a tool that is able to relieve Web users from repetition and tediousness of Web surfing to some degree.

2.5 Electronic Marketing
The World-Wide-Web (WWW) is a global information system which can be accessed via the Internet. Because of the remarkably rapid progress in information technology, people can use WWW significantly easier and faster than before (Aspray and Ceruzzi, 2008). The continuous decrease in prices of digital equipment makes it possible to digitize most information and present it online. This includes: text information, pictures, soundtracks, and video clips. Therefore, the Web has become the most effective and powerful information source for individuals (Ridley, 2009). The Web is also becoming an important platform for business, because convenience is making it more likely for people to shop online (Papastathopoulou and Avlonitis, 2009). The change from on-site commerce to online commerce makes it important to develop effective e-marketing and promotion models for Web service companies. E-marketing or internet marketing is one of the key components of e-commerce, which is the marketing of products or services over the Internet (Varadarajan and Yadav, 2009). Compared to traditional marketing, e-marketing has an intrinsic advantage in that 30

it can reach global customers with relatively lower advertising budgets, because the media of e-marketing, the Web, is worldwide and affordable to average individuals. Currently, online purchases by both businesses and consumers are dramatically increasing, which makes e-marketing a strategic way to achieve significant benefits and increase customer satisfaction for enterprises (Chaffey, 2009). However, some limitations of e-marketing prevent it from being a high efficient approach. One of the obstacles is that an enterprise can hardly provide customized services and promotions to an individual without knowing details about the person, which likely leads to less profit for an enterprise (Long and Tellefsen, 2007). In order to make Web services more effective, researchers have recently paid significant attention to the integration of Web service and user modeling. In these approaches, a Web page can treat a user profile intelligently based on the individual's interests, intent, or context (Zhu et al., 2003). Generally, in terms of the way in which user information is acquired and analyzed, there are two types of user modeling for a personalized Web service: implicit and explicit user modeling (Allen, 1990), which has been described in Section 2.2. The method of explicit user modeling is more accurate than implicit user modeling at the time of completing a survey (Zigoris and Zhang, 2006). However, for a user's general interest model, it is not practical to ask the user to express interest for every single category. Due to the complexity of an individual's intents and behaviors, meaningfully modeling a Web customer's interests, preferences, intents, or prospective behaviors remains a competitive challenge to researchers (Laroche, 2010). 31

Currently, a common methodology for grouping Web customers for Web services is combining content-based and collaboration based user classification. For instance, when a Web customer is searching and browsing an internet shop, such as Amazon, the user's navigational data/products are used to cluster the customer into a user group who has viewed the same products. Other group members' navigational data are recommended to the customer for the next round of navigation. Obviously, an e-marketing system based on this type of Web user classification is unable to satisfy the increasing requirement for accurate targeting for personalized e-commerce (Kalaignanam et al., 2008). The research reported in this dissertation is driven by the intent to effectively integrate Web user classification with e-marketing to provide personalized Web services. One objective of this research is to propose a framework for a dedicated user classification system for personalized e-marketing and promotion planning, which is motivated by improving profit and expanding impact for Web service companies. In the proposed framework, a Web customer's navigational data is used to create the general interest and local browsing models for the customer. The degree of potential purchase (DPP) is calculated based on the customer's models. Therefore, customers can be classified according to their DPPs, which paves the way for a personalized e-marketing strategy. Web user classification has attracted significant attention from researchers, due to the demand for rapid progress in the development of personalized Web services. If a Web customer can be precisely classified and understood by a service system, customized 32

service with accurate targeting and high efficiency becomes possible and practical. In the last two decades, several methodologies for Web user classification have been proposed. The survey method is a classic and effective way to directly determine customer intent and preference. This method is valid for both traditional services and Web service systems (Agichtein, 2006; Ridley, 2009). Haug (2006) discussed the advantages and limitations of Web surveys applied in population censuses. Haug (2006) indicates that the online population census is superior with regard to the costs of data entry, editing, interface, and accessibility. However it has some limitations such as identity validation, security of connection, and confidentiality. In 2007, the National Library of the Netherlands published a survey report on Web archiving (Ras and Bussel, 2007). Web users were immediately classified by answering the questionnaires. Five main user groups are mentioned in the report, which are: researcher (student, researcher, sociologist, historian, linguist, etc.), journalist, lawyer (lawyer and patent agent), consumer, and a group of other targets. The precise user classification made the survey analysis very reliable and convincing. Therefore, the report claims that the user test offered very valuable information. Though explicit user modeling and user classification methods have the advantage of high accuracy, their limitations of low convenience and restricted scalability make them unsuitable for complex environments. Therefore, researchers are paying significant attention to implicit and hybrid user classification methods. Digital libraries have become a popular platform for developing personalized Web services. A number of user 33

classification methods have been developed and implemented for personalized digital libraries (Theng et al., 1999; Cohen et al., 2000; Di Giacomo et al., 2000; Frias-Martinez et al., 2006; Avancini et al., 2007). These approaches for personalized digital libraries show various interfaces, search engines, and performance. Nevertheless, they basically use the common methodology of user modeling. In these digital library systems, the servers use the user's login information, including their username and their IP address, to distinguish the users. Based on the user's registration information, a plain classification method is used to group the users by gender, age, department, faculty, and position. Subsequently, the content-based user modeling method is used to estimate the user's interests, preferences, and behaviors in the library. The users can be classified by analyzing their user models; for example, users who have viewed the same book are grouped. Similarly, the idea of content-based user modeling is also widely used in general Web user classification. In the approach of Web user clustering presented by Rangarajan et al. (2004), a clustering algorithm based on the ART1 version of the adaptive resonance theory is applied. The URLs accessed by a Web user are extracted from the Web log files on the server. The vector generalized from the URLs most frequently accessed by all cluster members represents each user cluster. Liu and Keselj (2007) presented a method of classifying user navigation patterns using the combined mining of Web server logs and Web contents. In this approach, the textual content of Web pages is captured through extraction of character N-grams, which are combined with Web server log files to derive user navigation profiles. Some dissimilarity measure methods are used to calculate the profile dissimilarity. 34

Recently, due to rapid technological advances in the Web and information technology, e-commerce has become an important pillar for the development of a company. The prevalence of personal computers boosts the prosperity of the Internet business-to-consumer (B2C) market. In order to improve performance, personalized ecommerce models have been widely utilized by Web service companies. Researchers are also putting effort into seeking highly efficient personalized e-commerce models (Lee et al., 2002; Changchien et al., 2004; Wen et al., 2010). Lee et al. (2002) by presenting an intelligent agent-based system for personalized recommendations in e-commerce. The proposed system consists of two sub-systems: user modeling and recommendation. An agent-based methodology is used for customer modeling, information gathering, information managing, and evaluation. A multi-attribute decision making method is used for recommending products to a user. The flawed performance of user preference modeling is also discussed. Changchien et al. (2004) developed an online personalized promotion decision support system for e-commerce. The proposed system has three modules: marketing strategies, promotion patterns model and personalized promotion products. Customer behaviors from the three categories are analyzed through data mining techniques and statistical analysis. Different marketing plans are used for customers in different categories. There are a number of personalized Web service models in the literature. Many of them suffer from obscurity of the user modeling approach. Therefore, developing an effective Web user classification method has become a critical issue for improving the quality of Web services.

Chapter 3 Web Page Classification

Document classification is a research topic in information science. The objective of document classification is to group digital documents into different categories based on analyzing one or more features of each document. Since Web pages are a type of digital document, Web page classification is considered a specific document classification problem. Unlike pure-text classification, which is mainly focused on analyzing literal contents, Web page classification deals with complex digital objects that have more features and noise.

3.1 Introduction
Along with the rapid progress of electronics, communication networks, and computer technology, the Internet has become one of the largest platforms for information production, repository, distribution, and communication. Every day, tremendous numbers of Web sites and Web pages are created, both by companies and individuals, due to easy 36

access of Web content management systems and the low costs of Web space (Shuen, 2008). However, while the net brings people great convenience, it is also accompanied with new technical challenges, such as how Web users can efficiently retrieve specific Web pages that they are interested in from the immensely overwhelming information depository. Commonly, there are three approaches by which a Web customer can access the locations of Web contents: memory, hint, and tools. For Web sites that a Web user often browses on, the user can always save the location of the Web sites either in their mind or within their favorites list in the browsing software. The hint approach means that a user retrieves a Web page through the address link embedded at other Web pages. The limitations of the approach of memory and hint are the requirement of much human effort and randomness, respectively, which increasingly encourages Web users to choose the approach of tools to retrieve Web information. Currently, internet search engines are the most popular tools for Web information retrieval. In terms of data structure and search method, search engines can be divided into two types: query-based and directory-based search engines (Embleton and Heinrich, 2008). The query-based search engines are developed through four stages: collecting all terms and phrases of Web pages, filtering out redundant words, indexing Web pages by terms and phrases, and developing an interface. Therefore, internet users can retrieve the Web pages based on whether the query keywords appeared within the Web pages. Querybased search engines are relatively more efficient and effective, because their algorithms of extracting terms and indexing pages are straightforward and relatively simple; not too 37

much human effort is required for maintenance; and the compact and friendly interfaces are usually a great convenience to users (Ricardo and Berthier, 1999). However, there are still limitations with a query-based search engine. One of the most obvious limitations of such search engines is that the relevant Web pages may not be retrieved when the query keywords and the extracted terms of the Web page are not matched literally without further knowledge refining them (Conesa et al., 2008). The other type of search engines, e.g., directory-based search engines, can somehow make up for this deficiency (Gerstel et al., 2007). In a classical directory-based search engine, Web sites registered to the search engine or randomly crawled are classified hierarchically into categories. An internet user's exerted operation with directory-based search engines includes three steps: logging into a directory-based search engine, looking for the category which represents his or her desire and accesses to the category, and the selection of Web pages from the list in the category or using keywords to narrow down the list in the category (Comer, 2007). By using directory-based search engines, a user's search behavior is naturally bounded to the category he or she is interested in. Furthermore, no particular term-matching is required, compared to the query-based search engines. Therefore, the possibility and precision of retrieving relevant Web pages through directory-based search engines can be higher to some extent, presuming that all of the Web pages are included and classified correctly. However, most of the directory-based search engines cannot satisfy such a condition due to the fact that tremendous human efforts to classify all of the Web pages into appropriate categories based on their contents are not practical. Compared to query-based search engines, directory-based search engines require more human effort to classify and index 38

the pages. This limitation results in low quality and quantity of sorted Web sites to some directory-based search engines. For instance, to save human effort, most directory-based search engines only classify Web sites instead of Web pages, which cause all Web pages belonging to a Web site being partitioned into the same category, without considering whether or not there exist deviations between the Web pages in the Web site. Therefore, an efficient and effective classification method with little human effort for Web pages is highly demanded.

3.2 Outline of the Proposed Web Page Classification Method
A model of automatically classifying Web pages fusing three processes of classifying components of the Web pages is presented in this chapter. Because of the increase in noise information on Web pages, a method of Web page classification without any filter can barely classify an avalanche of new Web pages effectively. The proposed approach utilizes some features representing a Web page's meaning based on the Web page structure and a user's browsing habits. Diverse Web page features are extracted in the proposed approach, such as analyzing the text features of Web page titles and metasearch keywords, identifying the effective content from Web pages, and consulting a Web directory service. Through fusing the results from these three dedicated classifiers, Web pages are described and hierarchically classified into one or more categories. The schematic representation of the Web page classification method is illustrated in Figure 39

3.1. It includes feature extraction, parallel feature classification, and classification fusion. The remaining portion of this chapter explains the process of the proposed method.

3.3 Term Extraction and Weight Calculation
In text document classification, terms (important words and phrases) always play the most important and fundamental role; thus, the most features of a text document are extracted depending on certain terms. There are various methods to extract terms according to specific requirements of different classification systems. The simplest approach is to consider all words and phrases appeared in the text documents as terms. The popular idea is to determine valid terms based on their part of speech and the word frequency on training text documents, i.e., conjunction words, auxiliary words, and the words with either too high or too low frequency among the documents are not included in the term index (Ricardo and Berthier, 1999). This research adopts an alternate way to determine terms. There are three sources constituting the terms for the proposed automatic classification method of this research. The first part is based on the set of people's names in training text documents. The second part is obtained from an increasingly well-designed ontology database. The advantages of using an ontology database lie in the fact that: the ontologies themselves already eliminate meaningless words such as preposition words, auxiliary words, and pronoun words; the ontologies are extensible; and the ontologies have already been classified by the topics. In the experiments, this research makes use of the ontology from WordNet (Aggarwal et al., 2004; Miller, 2009), because of its comprehensiveness and accessibility. All terms in the domain categories and term categories in the WordNet are considered as terms for this research. An example of using the WordNet to extract terms concerned with the topic of 41

"computer science" is shown in Figure 3.2. The third part is the noun words which appear in the training text documents with a frequency between 30% and 60%.

Figure 3.2 The screen scan of the ontology database WordNet 42

In information retrieval and text miming, the tf­idf (term frequency­inverse document frequency) method has been proposed and applied broadly for quite a long time (Salton and Buckley, 1988). In fact, it employs a statistical measure to determine how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document, but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus. Variations of the tf­idf weighing scheme are often used by search engines as a central tool in scoring and ranking a document's relevance given a user query. A classic tf-idf method can be formulized by:

tf ij = freqij / max freqej
eS j _ term

(3.1)

idfi = log ( M / gi ) Wij = tfij × idfi

(3.2) (3.3)

where freqij is the number of occurrences of term ti in document dj; Sj_term is the set of terms in document dj; e indicates term te in document dj; M is the number of documents in the collection; gi is the document frequency for term ti in the whole document collection; tfij is the term frequency of term ti over document dj; idfi is the inverse document frequency of term ti; and Wij is the weight of term ti over document dj. According to Equation (3.2), it can be seen that the terms appearing in all categories will be weighted as 0, by which some trivial words are eliminated from the set of terms. However, since this research employs the ontology WordNet to determine the 43

terms, an alternative method is used to calculate the document frequency. Let Ni be the number of Web pages that contain term ti in all categories, and nij be the number of Web pages that contain term ti in category j, then idfi in Equation (3.2) can be modified to nij/Ni. Therefore, the weight of term ti over category j can be calculated by Wij = tfij × (nij/Ni) (3.4)

3.4 Web Page Classification Based on Single Component
3.4.1 Web Page Classification Based on Meta Information
In this research, the meta information of a Web page denotes the title and the meta name tagged in the Web page's source code, and the anchor text, if available. For example, the official Web site of Amazon (www.amazon.com) has the title "Amazon.com: Online Shopping for Electronics, Apparel, Computers, Books, DVDs & more", and the meta name "Online shopping from the earth's biggest selection of books, magazines, music, DVDs, videos, electronics,......, just about anything else". The combinational data set of these two strings forms the meta information of the Web page. Based on the meta information of the Web page and the term weight calculation method described in Section 3.3, a classifier can be utilized to determine the potential category towards Web pages, which is given by

44

Cat _ Meta(q ) = arg max
j

iS q _ meta

W

(3.5)

ij

where q is the query Web page; Cat_Meta is the function to determine the potential category towards the query Web page based on meta information; Sq_meta indicates the text of q's meta information; and Wij is the weight of the ith term in the jth category.

3.4.2 Web Page Classification Based on Effective Content
Along with the rapid progress of WWW, Web pages have been increasingly implanted with a great diversity of entertainment and commercial elements. Since this work only focuses on the main text content of Web page, advertisement banners and forward links are considered as noise information which needs to be eliminated. In order to filter out such noise, some rules are followed based on the usual structure of a Web page: (a) Searching for lexically identical sentences in the content area with the title in meta-information. Figure 3.3 shows two situations of lexical identity. (b) If there is a match between the title in meta-information and a phrase in the content area, the area contains the matched phrase is considered as the effective content area. (c) If there is no matching between the title in meta-information and any phrase in the content area, the following sub-steps are executed. 45

(c.1) The text area with a longer height is treated as the effective content area. (c.2) The text area with a wider width is considered as the effective content area. (c.3) If different columns have a similar height/width, the middle area is treated as the effective content area. (c.4) If the aforementioned rules are not applicable to the Web page, the text area with the maximum quantity of terms is considered as the effective content area.

After the effective content area has been determined, the same algorithm introduced in Section 3.4.1 is utilized to classify the content, which can be given by

Cat _ Cont (q ) = arg max
j

iS q _ cont

W

(3.6)

ij

where Cat_Cont is the function to determine the potential category towards the query Web page based on effective content information; Sq_cont indicates the text of q's effective content information.

46

Figure 3.3 Examples of lexical identity

3.4.3 Web Page Classification Based on Directory Service
As described in Chapter 2, current Web directory services cannot provide accurate identification to every given Web page, especially Web pages in the sub-directory of a Web site. Nevertheless, manual classification for the Web site can represent the main topic. Therefore, the category information provided by Web directory services is considered as a feature for a specific Web page (Kan and Thi, 2005). Among a number of Web directory service providers, this research employs the Google directory service. The process can be formulated by: FD(q) = GD (qlink) (3.7)

where FD(q) represents the directory feature of the query page's parent site; qlink 47

indicates the navigational link of the query page; and GD is the function characterizing the process of Google directory service. Figure 3.4 shows an example of retrieving the manual classification information for a Web page using the Google directory service.

Figure 3.4 An example of retrieving manual classification for a Web page using the Google directory service

3.5 Classification Fusion
The last step of the proposed automatic classification is to fuse the results from various feature analyses that have been described in Sections 3.4.1 to 3.4.3. If the classification results of both meta-information and effective content processing are identical, the 48

system is determined to comply with their classification results. The fusion method is formulated to be

Cat ( q ) = Cat _ Meta( q )
(if Cat _ Meta( q ) = Cat _ Cont (q ) )

(3.8)

where Cat is the fusion function to determine the relevant category towards a query Web page. If there exists a conflict between meta-information processing and effective content processing, a decision-making process is carried out. It assumes that Web page q is classified into category j1, j2, and j3 by the three separate classifiers respectively. Then the degrees of belief of Web page q belonging to category j1, j2, j3 are calculated and compared to determine the more relevant category. The degree of belief of Web page q belonging to category j is formulated to be

dob(q, j ) = 1

cSC iS q _ meta

 W

iS q _ meta

W

ij

+ 2

ic

cSC iS q _ cont

 W

iS q _ cont

W

ij

+ 3 FD j (q)

(3.9)

ic

where dob(q, j) indicates the degree of belief of Web page q belonging to category j; c indicates any category that can be recognized by the system; SC is the set of categories defined in the system; FD(q) indicates the classification result by the directory service, e.g., the value of |FDj(q)| is 1 when the Web directory service considers Web page q 49

belonging to category j; otherwise, the value of |FDj(q)| is 0; 1 is the factor for meta information classification, which is equal to 1; 2 is the factor for Web content classification, which is equal to the precision rate of determining the effective content area on training Web pages; and 3 is the factor for the directory service, which is equal to the precision rate of the directory service on training Web pages. Figure 3.5 illustrates the process of calculating the degree of belief that Web page q belongs to category j. The coefficient 1 indicates the confidence degree of correctly extracting meta-information from a Web page's source code. It is set to 1 because the structure of a Web page complied with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is fixed, so that the meta-information is extracted properly. Comparatively, the determination of effective content area may be inaccurate due to the flexible style of Web pages. Therefore, the coefficient 2 applied to the Web content classification is set to the degree of precision of choosing the effective content area, which can be implemented by obtaining the degree of accuracy from the training Web page database. When the degrees of belief for each category presented by each separate classifier are calculated, the fusion method can be formulated as:

Cat (q ) = arg max(dob(q, j ))
j{ j1 , j2 , j3 }

3.6 Experimental Results
This work utilizes internet news RSS feeders as the tool for collecting text databases to train the weights of terms. The well categorization and frequent updating of news Web sites make them a ready source of training text database. Moreover, the use of RSS removes most redundant HTTP tags and noise information such as headers, footers, and commercial advertisements. There are more than 7000 news Web pages that have been collected mapping to 12 main categories, which are arts, business, computers, culture, entertainment, health, home, movie and music, science, shopping, society, and sports. In order to show the capacity of hierarchical classification of the proposed method, a classifying process of a 2nd level category is also considered. The weights of terms for four types of sports are also calculated under the main category of sports. As far as the efficiency of choosing the effective content area is concerned, manual judgment and statistics are employed in the work. Up to 1100 Web pages belonging to five types of Web sites are chosen and applied with the method of determining the effective content area. The reason of separating the five types of Web sites is for the convenience of analyzing the proposed methods. The process of obtaining the efficiency of a Web directory service is similar to acquiring the effective content area. In this case, manual work is exploited to decide whether a Web page is accordant with the categorization of a Web site by the Web directory service. The experimental results of different steps are presented in this part. Table 3.1 shows the precision rate of determining the effective content area on five types of Web 52

sites. It shows that the proposed rules about choosing the effective content area of news Web pages exhibit a good performance, because a news Web page usually has the same title in both meta-information and content, which provides a useful hint for the system. Table 3.2 gives the precision rates of directory based classification, meta information based classification, effective content area based classification, and classification fusion. It shows a good performance on identifying a shopping Web page through the Web directory service, owing to the specificity of most shopping Web sites. On the contrary, the diversity of the Web pages in a BBS Web site or a Blog Web site results in a very low precision rate of the directory based classification. The result of Web page classification through comparing accumulated weights of terms from a Web page's meta-information implies that a well organized news or shopping Web site often has an appropriate connection between its meta-information and the Web content. It also indicates that the proposed text classification method based on the maximum accumulated weights of terms can distinguish text whether there is only a small quantity of noise information. However, with respect to blog and BBS Web pages, the lack of specific annotation for the meta-information and the diversity of their content decrease the precision rate of content classification.

The result of the Web page classification based on analyzing a Web page's content shows that the performance of the text classification on news Web pages is better than that on shopping Web pages, because of the lower precision of determining the effective content area on shopping Web pages. The vagueness of the content on some BBS Web pages and Blog Web pages makes them difficult to be classified into topic categories. Moreover, the complexity of BBS web pages and Blog Web pages decreases the precision of identifying the effective content area, which makes the precision rate of content classification lower. Table 3.2 also presents the results of classifying Web pages on the first level categories using the decision fusion integrating the three classifications. It shows that the overall precision rate on each type of Web page is higher than the result obtained from classification based on a single feature. Table 3.3 is an example result of classifying news Web pages on the second level category. It continues proving that the proposed classification method can achieve a good performance in the genre of news Web pages. According to the experimental results on the proposed Web page classification system, it is found that the performance of the proposed method is influenced by the genre of Web pages. It performs differently for different genres of Web site, due to the difference in the Web page's structure and nature. Obviously, the noise information in a blog Web page is possibly much more than that of a serious news Web page. Additionally, a blog may contain various topics in a Web page, which makes the Web 55

page categorization much more difficult. Nevertheless, the proposed classification method can achieve a good performance under the condition of Web environment with normal noise information. The proposed fusion algorithm can increase precision rate in all genres of Web site, which shows the effectiveness of the fusion algorithm.

3.7 Summary
This chapter has presented a framework to automatically classify Web pages based on three different features. First, the approach uses three features to classify Web pages separately. Afterwards, classification results from different classifiers are fused and reclassified. In these experiments, the proposed method is applied to automatically classify Web pages in twelve genres. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively increase the precision rate, compared to the classification method using single 56

features of Web pages. It also indicates that the proposed classification method yields a good performance on classifying both news and shopping Web pages. However, in the case of the Web environments with a great quantity of noise information, the performance of the proposed method is somewhat decreased. Nevertheless, the proposed classification system shows great potential for application on Web services demanding unsupervised Web page categorization.

Chapter 4 Web User Modeling

User modeling is a research field belonging to human factors. It aims to construct models of human attributes and behaviors in a specific industry or commercial environment. In an online service, a user's data is collected through the Internet, by which the online service can derive the user's goals, interests, preferences, information needs, etc. A user model can be defined as the computer representation of this information. Meanwhile, the systems that construct, maintain, and update user models are called user modeling systems. The result of a user model is usually stored in a specific computer document that is called a user profile. When the content of a user's model is needed for personalized services, it can be extracted from the user profile. As a key process of personalization on the Web, user modeling has been widely used in various personalized online services, such as Web searches, e-libraries, e-museums, and e-shops. Currently, many approaches for user modeling have been proposed for Web personalized systems. However, most of the approaches are designed for their own proprietary purposes and online systems. For the consideration of generalization, this

58

research aims to develop a user modeling system that can capture a user's interests and preferences for various personalized Web systems.

4.1 Introduction
An approach to model and quantify a user's interests and preference using the user's navigational data is presented in this chapter. The approach is based on the premise that frequently visiting certain types of content indicates that the user is interested in that content. Figure 4.1 shows the architecture of the proposed user modeling system. Using this system, a user's navigational data is tracked by the system for analyzing the user's interests and preferences. Web pages viewed by a user's are tracked by the system. These Web pages can be classified using the proposed classification method introduced in Chapter 3, while the source information of the Web page can be obtained directly from the http information of the page. Using Bayes theorem, a user's interest model can be obtained and updated by analyzing the content of the Web pages viewed by the user. The user's preference model can also be built and updated by analyzing the information sources of the viewed Web pages.

4.2 Collecting a Web User's Navigational Data
In order to analyze a Web user's navigational data, a method of navigational tracking is necessary. Several types of approaches to tracking personal navigational information have been utilized in user modeling systems. In an explicit user modeling system, a user's data is usually obtained by signup information or survey/questionnaire answers. When a user registers to use an online service, he/she may be asked to provide personal information such as gender, location, birthday, career, income, interests, and preferences. In some Web systems, a user's profile is directly constructed based on this collected personal data. The disadvantages of using signup information for user modeling are the limited scalability of signup information and infrequent updating of users' data. In order to acquire more information from users, marketing researchers usually employ another explicit method of collecting user data: online survey, e.g., design a series of questions for users to answer. In this way, specific and in-depth personal data can be collected without or with little analysis. However, many Web users are not willing to spend time on these tedious and time-consuming surveys. Setting up a cookie in a user's computer is an easy and low-cost method. However, it can only track a user's navigational data in a certain Web site based on this method. To install a tracking tool in a user's computer is another option. For example, many Internet Explorer add-on programs can track the typing information in the address 61

bar. But many people are not willing to install any tracking software on their computers for the consideration of anti-virus and security reasons. Therefore, this research chooses the third option of tracking a user's navigational data: proxy server. When a user browses the net through a proxy server, the proxy server can monitor any information between the user and the Web, which greatly satisfies the needs of the user modeling system. The disadvantages of employing a proxy server for tracking are the relatively high-cost and the limited number of simultaneous users. This research aims to find out the theoretical effectiveness of the proposed systems, so that only a dozen of test users are asked to participate. Therefore, the disadvantages of using a proxy server can be neglected in this research. Figure 4.2 shows the interface of the proxy server for monitoring user's navigational data. Users are required to type Web links into the address input-area of the user modeling system, instead of the address box of the navigation software. The proposed user modeling system can monitor a user's navigational activities and store the collected Web addresses viewed by the user into a history-data document. Figure 4.3 shows an example of collected data from a Web user.

4.3 Analysis of a Web User's Navigational Data
When a user's navigational data is captured by the proposed user modeling system, the system will identify the category topics that are relative to the Web pages viewed by the user. Using the Web page classification method presented in Chapter 3, the analysis of a Web user's navigational data can be described in the following steps: (a) A user opens a Web page, which is monitored by the user modeling system. (b) The multimedia part of the Web page is filtered out, e.g., images, video clips, flash contents, etc., are removed by the system. (c) Determine the meta information and the effective content of the Web page. (d) Classify the Web page based on meta information, effective content, directory information, respectively. (e) Fuse the separated classification results. (f) Map the Web page to a category topic. Therefore, the Web pages viewed by a user are mapped to relative category topics.

4.4 Web User Modeling
The user interest model referred to in this work represents the degree to which a Web user is interested in each category topic. By using the method of Web page classification 64

presented in Chapter 3, a Web user's navigational information can be grouped into different topic categories. Frequent visits of Web pages belonging to a topic category indicate that the user is interested in that topic. Mathematically, the Naïve Bayes theorem can be applied to this situation for quantitative measurement.

4.4.1 Naïve Bayes Theory
The Naive Bayes Model is a simple and well-known method for performing supervised learning of a classification problem (Kotsiantis and Pintelas, 2005; Ghosh et al., 2006; Mittal et al., 2007). It is based on a simple result from Bayes' theorem in statistics. The method is relatively easy to code in software. Bayes' theorem can be formulated as:

p(C | F1 , F2 ,..., Fn ) =

p(C ) p( F1 , F2 ,..., Fn | C ) p( F1 , F2 ,..., Fn )

(4.1)

where C is a dependent class variable and F1, F2, ..., Fn are feature variables. Assume the system satisfies the condition of the naïve conditional independence:

p( Fx | C , Fy ) = p( Fx | C )
Then Bayes' theorem can be rewritten as:

(4.2)

65

p(C | F1 , F2 ,..., Fn ) ==

p(C ) p( Fn | C )
i =1

n

p( F1 , F2 ,..., Fn )

(4.3)

where p(F1, F2, ..., Fn) is a scaling factor, which might be a constant if the values of the feature variables are known. Equation (4.3) is called the Naive Bayes Model. Compared to the Bayes model, the Naïve Bayes model is more manageable for computations, since it is partitioned into the class prior p(C) and the independent probability distributions p(Fi|C).

4.4.2 User's Interest Modeling
When a user is browsing Web page q, and q is determined to be relevant to category j through the auto-classification method described in Chapter 3, the user's likelihood of interest on category j can be updated by the following equations:

p1 = p (in _ j ) × p (view _ q | in _ j )  p (in _ j | view _ q )
p 2 = p(not _ in _ j ) × p(view _ q | not _ in _ j )  p(not _ in _ j | view _ q )
p (in _ j ) = p1 /( p1 + p 2 )

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

66

where p(in_j) indicates the user's degree of interest on category j; p(not_in_j) is the probability that the user is not interested in category j, and p(not_in_j)=1-p(in_j); p(in_j|view_q) is the probability that the user is interested in category j under the condition of opening Web page q; p(view_q|in_j) is obtained by the historical frequency of the interested categories, which is equal to f(interested_category)/total_view, where f(interested_category) is the average click rate of the user's interested category, and total_view is the overall click rate of all the navigations; and p(view_q|not_in_j) is obtained by f(not_interested_category)/total_view, where f(not_interested_category) is the average click rate of the user's non-interested category. When a user is browsing Web page q, and q is determined not to be relative to category j, Equations (4.4-4.6) are still applicable, with only the changes that p(view_q|in_j) is obtained by f(not_interested_category)/total_view, and

p(view_q|not_in_j) is obtained by f(interested_category)/total_view.

4.4.3 User's Preference Modeling
The Web preference model indicates the degrees of preference to Web sites (Web sources) where a user prefers to retrieve information. Similar to the assumption that has been made in the interest model, it is assumed that frequently visiting Web pages from a Web site indicates that the user is willing to retrieve information from that Web source. The same algorithm used to identify a user's interest model can also be employed to 67

estimate a user's preference on the Web site. A user's degree of preference on Web site s is updated by the following equations:

p3 = p (in _ s ) × p (view _ q | in _ s )  p (in _ s | view _ q )

(4.7)

p 4 = p(not _ in _ s ) × p(view _ q | not _ in _ s )  p (not _ in _ s | view _ q)
p(in _ s ) = p3 /( p3 + p4 )
(4.8)

(4.9)

where p(in_s) indicates the user's degree of preference for retrieving information from Web site s; p(not_in_s) is the probability that the user is not interested in retrieving information from Web site s, and p(not_in_s)=1-p(in_s); p(in_s|view_q) is the probability that the user is interested in retrieving information from Web site s under the condition of opening Web page q; p(view_q|in_s) is obtained by the historical frequency of viewing information of the Web sites, which is equal to f(preferred_website)/total_view, where f(preferred_website) is the average click rate of the user's preferred Web sites, and total_view is the overall click rate of all the navigations; and p(view_q|not_in_s) is obtained by f(not_preferred_website)/total_view, where f(not_preferred_website) is the average click rate of the user's non-preferred Web site.

68

4.5 Experimental Results
In order to simplify the system, a one layer-based topic structure is applied to the proposed interest modeling. A user's models are dynamic and updated in real-time, because the user's navigational data is tracked and analyzed every time the user's Web activity is identified. A test user's normalized interest model at a certain time is shown in Table 4.1. For the purpose of normalization, the sum of a user's degree of interest on topic categories is set to 1. A test user's partial preference model at a certain time is shown in Table 4.2. Since an information source is defined as a Web site in this work, the preference model is a data structure with an enormous number of elements. Nevertheless, most users browse Web information within a small number of Web sites. For the sake of reducing the computational burden, a degree of preference below 0.005 is restated as 0 in the user modeling process. The proposed method can also be used in a hierarchical structure-based modeling approach. Figure 4.4 shows the experimental results of a tester's degree of interest on the three sports subjects by using the proposed method during a period of time. This user model is constructed under the first level category topic of sports.

4.6 Summary
A framework to model a user's interests and preferences based on the user's navigational data has been presented. The approach uses the cumulative weights of terms to classify Web pages that the user is browsing. Once the content of the Web page is classified and determined, the user's interest model is updated using the Naïve Bayes Theory. A demonstration interface has been designed and implemented in order to test the proposed method. In the experiments, the proposed method is applied to quantify a user's degrees 71

of interest on twelve subjects and degrees of preferences on different Web sites. It also gives an experimental example of constructing a second level model of user interests. The experimental results showed that the proposed method could effectively model the user's interests. The proposed model can be integrated with personalized Web services.

Chapter 5 Personalized Web Search

Web search engines are one of the most useful and popular online services used today. There are two types of search engines: directory-based and query-based search engines. Normally, directory-based search engines have more complicated interfaces than querybased search engines. Moreover, directory-based search engines are challenged by how to automatically classify Web contents efficiently and reduce human effort. Contrarily, query-based search engines have compact interfaces and a structure that is easy to maintain, making them easy to implement and use. However, a traditional search engine faces the difficulty of distinguishing intents of users. For example, a traditional search engine can hardly determine a user's intent if a polysemy word is queried. The personalization on Web systems is a method to relieve this difficulty. A search engine can be integrated with a user modeling system, by which the likely interests and preferences of users can be utilized for re-ranking search results.

73

5.1 Introduction
The architecture of the proposed personalized Web search method is shown in Figure 5.1. A user's interest model, preference model, and search context model are the main components of the proposed personalized search ranking system (PSRS). The user modeling approach consisting of a user's interest and preference models is based on the premise that frequently visiting certain types of content indicates that the user is interested in that content, which is discussed in Chapter 4. The proposed approach can be divided into three steps: monitoring the user's navigational data; using the Web page classification method developed to determine a Web page's content; and employing the Naïve Bayes theory for updating the user's interest model. The same three steps can also be utilized to determine a user's Web preference model. In this work, the Web preference model assigns a value to a Web site (information source) based on the degree to which a user prefers to retrieve information from that Web site.

A method of auto-classifying Web pages discussed in Chapter 3 is employed as a part of the proposed user modeling process. The work employs a well-designed ontology database, WordNet (Aggarwal et al., 2004; Miller, 2009), to represent valid terms for the automatic classification method. The tf­idf (term frequency­inverse document frequency) method is adopted to determine how important a word is to a document (category), e.g., the weight of the term to the category. First, three components of a Web page are classified separately: classification of meta information, classification of effective content area, and classification by the Web directory service. The classifications of meta information and effective content area are based on the cumulative weight of the terms, while a Web directory service can directly classify a small number of Web pages on the Internet. The classification results from the three components are fused to classify the Web pages into categories. Tracking and recording a user's selections from the search results built up the user's search context model. In each Web search session, the Web pages viewed by a user in sequence represent the user's judgment on the search result of the query. The set of a user's selections in search sessions forms the user's search context model. In a Web search session, the user's selection (context model) may differ from the vector of Web pages presented by the search engine. The system will check each jumpover's ranking of Web pages, in order to verify whether the user's interest or preference likely caused the jump-over. The influence factors of a user's interest model and preference model can be determined by statistically analyzing the jump-overs. 76

In the proposed personalized Web search system, by incorporating the influence factors and the user's interest and preference models, the rank of Web pages in a search session is recalculated. In other words, if a Web page is found to be more related to the user's interest and/or preference models, and the user is usually found to be influenced by his interests and preferences in search sessions, the rank of the Web page will be raised significantly. Details on the search context model and the re-ranking of search results are discussed in this chapter.

5.2 Conventional Web Search Engines
It is a well known fact that the Web is a huge repertory, consisting of various types of Web sites and online documents. The basic data structure of the Web is the connection between a URL address and an online target, such as a Web site, a Web page, or a digital document. Therefore, the straightforward strategy of retrieving online information is direct navigation that requires a user to input a link address into the browser. This method is often used while a user logs into the frequently visited Web sites. However, this strategy is not efficient for Web sites with complex structure, and not applicable for the Web sites that a user cannot correctly input the URL addresses. Another strategy of retrieving Web information is to click a link to open a Web page. In a Web site where the contents are well-organized and the links to the contents are provided to users, this method is effective and adopted by users. Figure 5.2 shows an example of retrieving Web 77

information by links in the CBC Web site. However, without the organization of links, it is difficult for users to access Web sites of interest by clicking links in between them. Therefore, an information retrieval tool, which is known as a search engine, is used for users to efficiently obtain the Web information of interest. A directory-based search engine has three processing steps: collecting information of Web sites, classifying Web sites, and presenting links to Web sites hierarchically. Figure 5.3 shows the interface of a directory-based search engine. In this type of search engine, Web links are categorized into different topics. Therefore, a user can reach the links of interest by selecting the relevant topics. Along with the rapidly increasing number of Web sites, directory-based search engines have gradually shown their limitations. Firstly, to classify Web sites either increases machine computational burden or requires a lot of manual works. Secondly, it is difficult to present the relevant Web sites to users, because the number of Web sites belonging to a category topic is very large. Thirdly, a directory-based search engine only classifies Web sites and provides links of Web sites, which cannot guide a user directly to the Web pages of interest. Query-based search engines are more popular than directory-based search engines because they are intuitive, simple to use, and easy to maintain. A query-based search engine can be considered as a tool for retrieving information from a database. The input of a search activity is a set of query terms, while the output is a set of Web links whose targeting Web pages contain the query terms. A query-based search engine usually has a

78

compact interface, which is illustrated in Figure 5.4. In the search engine, the search results are presented right after the query terms are submitted.

5.3 Personalized Web Search Engine
This research attempts to identify the relationship between a user's Web search behaviors and his or her interest and preference models, so that a personalized Web search method can be developed based on this relationship. In other words, based on analyzing a user's search behaviors, the system will determine how the interests and preferences of the user influence the search results. The system will then provide a personalized search solution for the user based on that influence.

5.3.1 User's Search Context Model
In a query-based search engine, a document vector of Web pages is linked to a set of 81

query keywords. When a user sends a query to the Web search engine, a set of Web pages will be fed back with the highest ranked Web page at the top. This query operation can be formulated as: Query(qkr)=mr (5.1)

where Query represents the function of query operation; qkr is the vector of query keywords in search session r; and mr is the resulting vector of Web pages in search session r, which is also represented as (mr(1), mr(2)..., mr(lw)), where lw is the number of relevant Web pages, mr(1) is the Web page with the highest rank score calculated by the Web search engine, and mr(lw) has the lowest rank score among the given Web pages. In a conventional search engine system, the ranking of the documents for a query is the same to all the users regardless of whether the users have their own judgment on the resulting Web pages. An individual's own ranking preference is represented by his or her navigational context on the resulting Web pages, which is inferred from the assumption that an individual usually first views the best matched Web page from his or her perspective, then the Web page of the second best match, etc. Therefore, the context vector of the Web pages viewed by a user during the search session r can be described as vr, e.g., (vr(1), vr(2), ..., vr(lo)), with vr(1) being the initial Web page opened by the user, vr(2) the second Web page viewed, and vr(lo) the last Web page viewed by the user in search session r. In this work, vr is considered as the rth component of the user's search context model, which represents the user's personal ranking in search session r.

82

5.3.2 Proposed Personalized Search Ranking
A user's interest and preference models are built and updated based on his or her long-term navigational data. For each user's very first search query, the results presented to the user are the exact duplicates of one generated by the conventional search engine. Subsequently, the vector of Web pages viewed by a user is compared with the vector of Web pages resulting from the Web search engine. The user's search behavior data is utilized to determine how the user's interest and preference models impact his or her personal judgment on the given Web pages. The re-ranked results will then be presented to the user and the user's click-through is tracked. Any ranking change from the given search results to the user's context model indicates the dissimilarity between the search engine's ranking algorithm and the user's judgment. For example, if the vector of Web pages mr (=(mr(1), mr(2), mr(3), ..., mr(lw))) is the search result of a user's rth search session, and the user's search context vector in this session is (mr(3), mr(1)), e.g., the user viewed Web pages mr(3) and mr(1) successively, then there are two instances of ranking jump-over observed, which are mr(3) over mr(2), and mr(3) over mr(1). The pseudo code of determining the total number of instances of ranking jump-over from the search result to the user's context model is given in the next page:

83

________________________________________________________________________ read user's context vector v=(v(1), v(2), ... v(lo)), read search result m, for i=1, lo, i++ find n, that m(n)=v(i), for j=1, n-1, j++ if m(j) is prior than v(i) in the user's context model then no ranking jump-over, else ranking jump-over is determined, Sumjumpover= Sumjumpover+1, end if end for end for ________________________________________________________________________ The next step is to utilize the ranking jump-over to determine the influence of factors in a user's interest model and preference model. Using the same example discussed above, the Web pages involved in ranking jump-over can be mapped to categories: Cat(mr(1)), Cat(mr(2)), and Cat(mr(3)), by using the classification method introduced in Chapter 3. If the user's interest model shows that the user's degree of interest in Cat(mr(3)) is higher than the degree of interest in Cat(mr(1)), then the ranking jump-over of mr(3) versus mr(1) is considered as the case that the user's interest model 84

influences his or her search behavior. After taking into account the ranking jump-overs in all search sessions, the influence factor of a user's interest model can be determined statistically: 4=(jump-overs influenced by a user's interest)/(jump-overs) (5.3)

The same method can also be applied to determine the influence factor of a user's preference model: 5=(jump-overs influenced by a user's preference)/(jump-overs) (5.4)

Since the conventional search engines only provide ranking results without the appearance rates of Web pages, an inverse distance measure is used to estimate the rates in a search session (Teevan et al., 2010), which is formulated as: ER(m(k))=1/(+log(k)) (5.5)

where ER(m(k)) is the estimated rate of the kth Web page in a search result;  is the initial coefficient which is set to 2 in this work; and  is the attenuation coefficient which is set to 1. The choice of the coefficients is taken into account for the relatively smooth decreasing and dominance of the top ten ranks, which is shown in Figure 5.5.

0.6 0.5 0.4 ER(m(k)) 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 0 5 10 15 k 20 25 30

Figure 5.5 The rate estimation of the Web pages in a search result

Once a user's interest model, preference model, and influence factors have been determined, a personalized search rank algorithm can be applied, which is RR(m(k)) = ER(m(k))(1+ 4UserInterest(Cat(m(k))))(1+5UserPreference(IS(m(k)))) (5.6) where RR represents the re-rating function; UserInterest calls equation (4.6) to retrieve the user's degree of interest in category Cat(m(k)); IS(m(k)) is the function of identifying the information source (Web site) of Web page m(k); and UserPreference calls equation (4.9) to retrieve the user's degree of preference on Web site IS(m(k)).

86

Ultimately, the web pages are arranged by their re-rating value RR(m(k)), e.g., the Web page with the maximum re-rating value is listed at the top. Therefore, the personalization of a search engine is implemented by re-ranking the Web pages based on user models.

5.4 Experimental Results
In this work, a user's click-through in a search session is considered as the user's search context model. In order to clarify the construction of a user's search context model, an example of a user's click-through is shown in Table 5.1. The central column shows the top 10 Web page results presented by the Google search engine with the query keyword "personalization". The right column shows the user's click-through during this search session, e.g., the user viewed the 7th Web page and 1st Web page, successively. Therefore, the user's search behavior in this session can be modeled as {"7 Personalization Gallery Microsoft", "1 Personalization Wikipedia"}. When a user clicks the 7th Web page first, ranking jump-overs occur. It is necessary to identify whether the jump-overs are likely influenced by the user's interest and/or preference. Using the proposed Web page classification method to analyze the content of the 7th and other top 6 Web pages, it is found that the 7th Web page belongs to the "Computers" category, while 4 of the top 6 Web pages belong to other categories. Since the user's interest model shows that the user is more interested in the "Computers" category than any other topic, the 4 cases of jump87

over are supportive to increase the influence factor of interest model, e.g., 4 is updated to (sum of jump-overs influenced by a user's interest +4 )/(sum of jump-overs + 6). The same procedure for updating the influence factor of preference model 5 is conducted simultaneously. The purpose of developing a personalized search system is to change the search ranking results based on a user's models, so that the user can retrieve information of interest more effectively. Table 5.2 shows an example of the proposed personalized reranking of search results based on the user's models. From the results of re-ranking, it is shown that Web pages that are relevant to a user's topics of interest like "Computers", and a user's preferred Web site like "Google", are rearranged to the top of the list.

5.5 Evaluation
In order to evaluate the proposed personalized Web search method, 12 participants were asked to surf the Internet and conduct Web searches for their daily requirements under the system's supervision. All participants have at least a Bachelor's degree. The participants' interest, preference, and context models were constructed during their Web navigation. In order to alleviate the computational burden, the top 30 Web pages are reranked by the personalized search system. Even though the explicit measurements of relevance can clarify the precision rate and recall rate judged by the users, an implicit measurement is applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed personalized Web search method. Due to the fact that a user's experience of a practical search is the greatest concern, the implicit measurement approach is chosen. Table 5.3 shows the comparison of the users' average first-click on the personalized search results and the conventional search results tracked in 100 practical search sessions. The average first-click of the participants on the personalized re-ranking Web pages is 3.09, while it is 3.80 when the clicked Web pages are mapped to the conventional search results. Therefore, the average improvement of the first-click provided by the personalized re-ranking method is 0.71. In order to check the statistical significance of the results shown in Table 5.3, a paired t-test (Box et al., 1978) is conducted based on the 12 participants' average rates of first-click. Denote participant i's average rates of first-click on the personalized and conventional search results by x1,i and x2,i, respectively. There are three steps for carrying

(b) Determine p-value from the t-value using the t-table. In a statistical analysis, if the p-value is below a selected threshold for statistical significance (often the 0.01, 0.05, or 0.10 level), the result is considered to be statistically significant. By conducting the paired t-test, the observed difference of the mean value between the personalized and conventional search models in Table 5.3 is found to be statistically significant having t=7.83 and p<0.01. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed system based on a user's overall click-through, the method of Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG) is employed in this work (Jarvelin and Kekalainen, 2000). Considering that the higher ranked Web pages have higher scores in the evaluation, the ith Web page in a search result set can be scored by: Score(i) = 1/log2(1+i) (5.8)

During a search session, a user will click the Web pages if they think it is relevant to the query. Therefore, the ranking-efficiency can be obtained by weighing the user's click-through in a search session. Equation (5.9) presents a measurement of ranking93

efficiency for a user's search session: E = ((Score(i)Click(i)))/Click(i) (5.9)

where Score(i) is the score of Web page i in a user's search session as defined in Equation (5.7); and Click(i) indicates if the user opens the ith Web page. Click(i) is 1 when the user opens Web page i, otherwise Click(i) is 0. Table 5.4 shows the comparison of the average ranking-efficiency of both the personalized and conventional searches through the investigation of the participants' 100 rounds of search sessions. The average ranking-efficiency of the conventional search engine based on the participants' search behaviors is 0.44. The personalized search method improves the ranking-efficiency to 0.52. Therefore the ranking-efficiency of the personalized search is 18% higher than the conventional search. Moreover, there is no obvious regression of the ranking-efficiency observed on any participant's search data, which implies the generality of the proposed re-ranking method.

5.6 Summary
A novel method for a personalized Web search system has been proposed in this chapter. A Web page auto-classification method is utilized to analyze a user's navigational data, which helps to build and update the user's interest model. The user's preference model is constructed by analyzing the information sources (Web sites) of the user's navigational data. The user's click-through during a search session is interpreted as the user's search context model which is used to determine how the user's interest and preference models influence his or her search behavior. Finally, the personalized re-ranking algorithm is implemented by recalculating the score of a Web page based on the user's interest and preference models. The experimental results show an obvious improvement of the search ranking provided by the proposed personalized search method. The proposed system utilizes both content-based and behavior-based modeling approaches for the Web search personalization.

Chapter 6 News Recommender System

6.1 Introduction
The rapid development of electronics and the World Wide Web (WWW) have significantly impacted our society and daily lives (Health, 2008). Currently, the Web is widely used for individuals and organizations in various fields, such as e-banking, education, e-commerce, research, news distribution, entertainment, and communication (Adam et al., 2002; Albers and Clement, 2007; Chen et al., 2007; Li et al., 2008; Van Den Heuvel and Papazoglou, 2010; Von Borstel and Gordillo, 2010). Over the past few of years, the amount of online information brought and distributed by online services has been rapidly expanding. Moreover, due to the increasing popularity of the WWW, the acceleration of this information explosion on the Web keeps growing. Accordingly, Web users are requesting more and more retrieval tasks with their increasing familiarity with utilizing the Web. However, the Web is well known as a poorly organized and indexed information repository due to the extreme openness and diversity of the Web's structure and information. Currently, a combination of using Web search engines and manual Web 97

navigation is one of the most commonly used methods for searching and retrieving contents on the Web (Trestian et al., 2010). Although search engines have become the most popular tool to retrieve information from the Web, they do not take the initiative in providing information to a user without the process of a query. Most people frequently retrieve information from Web sites they are familiar with, whose contents are updated from time to time; news sites, product information pages, and personal blog sites for instance. It is often tedious and time consuming to repeatedly check each Web site for any new content. Therefore, a Web feed format called Really Simple Syndication (RSS) was designed and used to automatically distribute frequently updated Web files to users (Pera and Ng, 2008). RSS is one of the solutions used to notify subscribers of any new updated content on the Web. By using the RSS based Web content notification and downloading systems, a user can manage the updated files from multiple Web sites in a much simpler way. The resulting files are grouped based on their Web sources and presented in an organized email structure. However, RSS cannot take charge of most individuals' navigation on the Web due to its inherent limitations. Obviously, one limitation of RSS is that not every Web site integrates RSS into its online service. In addition, updated contents are simply organized by their information sources (Web sites) to RSS subscribers, which is non-flexible and unintelligent. Therefore, significant attention has been paid to recommender systems as the other approach to active information distribution (Adomavicius & Tuzhilin, 2005a). This approach is focused on delivering information of interest to Web users with little manual effort.

Accordingly, the main objective of this chapter is to develop a Web content recommender system. A user's long term interest and preference models are constructed based on the user's navigational history and integrated with the recommender system. The similarity between Web content and the user's models is used to determine whether the content will be provided to the user. A user collaboration method is designed to improve the effectiveness of the proposed recommender system.

6.2 Architecture of the Proposed Recommender System
The architecture of the proposed hybrid recommender system for news recommendation on the Web is shown in Figure 6.1. In the system, a Web user is distinguished by identifying his or her interest and preference models. A user's navigational data is monitored and analyzed to conduct user modeling. The automatic classification method presented in Chapter 3 is utilized to categorize the Web contents browsed by a user. In the proposed Web page classification method, the ontology base WordNet determines the terms (Aggarwal et al., 2004; Miller 2009), and the weights of terms are calculated by the tf­idf (term frequency­inverse document frequency) method. Three components of a Web page, meta information, effective content area, and the Web address, are extracted and classified separately. The cumulative weights of the terms are utilized for the classification of meta information and effective content areas, while a small number of Web pages on the Internet can be directly classified through a Web directory service. A 99

fusion method is used to combine the classification results for the three components.

It is assumed that a user is interested in a certain type of content if the user frequently visits that type of content. The user modeling method presented in Chapter 4 is 100

utilized in the proposed recommender system. It consists of two steps: determining the content of a Web page using the Web page classification method; and utilizing the Naïve Bayes model for updating the user's interest and preference models. In this work, a user's preference model scores a Web site based on the degree to which the user prefers to retrieve information from that Web site. The recommendation rating of the proposed system can be divided into two steps. First, a content-based algorithm is utilized to determine the probability of recommending Web content to a user, considering the factors of the user's interest and preference models, the Web content, and the time limitation. Second, the method of collaborative filtering is used to modify the probability of recommending Web content. The system will distribute some test Web content, which has been well classified and identified by users. The users who send back positive responses are considered as the trusted users. Additionally, the Web content browsed by more trusted users will obtain higher scores in the recommending process. reported by Wen et al. (2009) A preliminary version of the recommender system is

6.3 The Proposed Recommender System
The personalization of online services usually requires the identification of users based on their interests, preferences, navigational data, purchased products, etc. The contentbased recommendation method is available if user modeling is feasible. Many techniques 101

of modeling a Web user's interests and preferences have been presented (Boutemedjet and Ziou, 2008; Frias-Martinez et al., 2006; Teevan et al., 2010). There are two types of approaches to user modeling: explicit and implicit approaches. In an explicit approach, a user is asked to present his or her preferences directly, while in an implicit approach, the system usually builds up a user's models by analyzing the user's tracked information. A news recommender system can be integrated with either of the two user modeling methods. For example, a news subscription system is a typical recommender system that uses the explicit user modeling method. This work employs the implicit approach to user modeling that is presented in Chapter 4 for news recommendation.

6.3.1 User Modeling for the Recommender System
In the proposed recommender system, the construction of a user's interest and preference models is based on analyzing the user's navigational data. In order to identify a Web page browsed by a user, a method of auto-classifying Web pages based on various features (Wen et al., 2008b) is applied, which has been explained in Chapter 3. The schematic representation of the classification solution used in the system is illustrated in Figure 6.2. The classification method includes three steps: content separation, parallel feature classification, and a combination of the results. Initially, a Web page's hyperlink information, meta information, and content information are analyzed for classification, respectively. Then, a fusion algorithm generates the final 102

classification result. In this approach, in order to classify text information such as a Web page's meta and content information, weights of terms in categories are used for computing the cumulative weights of terms in the target text. In this work, the user interest model indicates the degree of a user's interest in each topic category, while the preference model represents the user's degree of preference for a Web source (Web site) to acquire information. Based on the premise that frequently visiting Web pages belonging to a certain category indicates that the user is interested in that topic, a user's interest model can be constructed by analyzing the user's navigational data. After applying the method of Web page classification, the Web pages browsed by a user can be categorized into different topic categories. Therefore, a quantitative measurement for creating and updating a user's interest model is available by utilizing the Bayes theorem. The process of modeling a user's interests and preferences for the personalized recommender is illustrated in Figure 6.3. The algorithm for updating a user's models is given and explained by Equations (4.4) to (4.9).

6.3.2 Web Content Recommendation
This work attempts to recommend Web news content to a user based on their interest and preference models, Web contents, and the behaviors of other users. After a user's interests and preferences have been identified, they are used to determine if certain Web content will be recommended to a user. For an item of Web news, three components of the content need to be quantified: the degree of the Web content belonging to the categories, the source of the Web content, and the time factor. Equation (3.8) or (3.10) can be applied to calculate the degree of the Web content belonging to the categories. The quantification of mapping the Web content to Web sites is straightforwardly determined by its hyperlink. Assuming Web page q is located in Web site s, the degree of the relationship between Web page q and Web site s is assigned as 1, e.g., DSs(q)=1, while the degree of the relationship between Web page q and other Web sites is 0. The time factor is taken into account to indicate the real-time value of news on the Web. It is empirically formulated by
l + h / 24 ) 7

T (q ) = 0.5 + 0.5 /(1 + wk +

(6.1)

where T(q) is the time factor for Web page q; wk is the number of weeks that Web page q has been released; l means the lth day after wk weeks since the release of Web page q; and h indicates the hth hour after wk weeks and l days since news page q has been released. Based on a user's models and the analysis of news items, the probability of 105

recommending a news page to the user can be formulated as
pr (q) = T (q) ×  ( DW ( s ) × (0.5 + 0.5 DS s (q))) ×
sSS

jSC

 ( DU ( j ) × DP (q))
j

(6.2)

where pr(q) indicates the probability of recommending Web page q to a user; T(q) is the time factor for Web page q; SS is the set of all Web sources; DW(s) is the degree of a user's preference for retrieving information from Web site s; DSs(q) is the relationship if Web page q is located in Web site s; SC is the set of all categories considered in the work; DU(j) is the degree of a user's interest on category j; and DPj(q) is the probability of Web page q belonging to category j. Considering that inevitable errors may arise by the current techniques of user modeling and Web page auto-classification, a method of collaborative filtering (CF) is utilized to adjust the recommender system. The process of adjustment based on CF is as follows. (a) The classified Web pages that are either clustered manually or acquired from well classified Web sites are considered as test pages. (b) Based on interest models, test Web pages are provided to the corresponding users. In other words, the test Web pages belonging to a certain category topic are delivered to the users who are likely interested in that topic according to the users' models. (c) Users' feedback on the test Web pages is collected by the system. The users who 106

positively respond to the test pages are regarded as trusted users on the related topic until the next round of testing. (d) Navigational data from the trusted users is collected by the system. The likelihood of an item belonging to a certain category is increased if trusted users give many positive responses to the item. Moreover, the degree of popularity for news items is calculated based on the click rate of the trusted users. The degree of popularity for a Web page can be determined by whether or not the users who are interested in a certain topic category recommend the Web page. Based on the process of CF, the recommendation equation (6.2) therefore is modified to:
pr (q) = T (q) ×  ( DW ( s ) × (0.5 + 0.5 DS s (q))) ×
sSS

jSC

 ( DU ( j ) × DP (q)) × (1 + 0.5DO(q))

(6.3)

where DO(q) is the degree of popularity for Web page q, which is the percentage of the response from the trusted users.

6.4 Experimental Results and Discussion
In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed Web news recommender system, evaluation experiments and results are presented in this section.

107

6.4.1 Evaluation of Recommender Systems
Because of intrinsic features of recommender systems, the statistical-based comparison of recommender systems is difficult to apply. Herlocker et al. (2004) discussed several reasons why quantitative evaluations of different recommender systems are usually incomparable. First, different recommender systems usually use different data sets. For example, it is not practical that retail recommender systems have identical products. news recommender systems often have different news sources, collection rules, and languages. Advertisement recommender systems have different clients and targets. Second, evaluation of recommender systems is difficult because of the differences in rating properties, such as density and scale. In other words, each recommender system may use a dedicated criteria of rating, which keeps the systems from a fair comparison. Third, the goals for evaluation of recommender systems may differ. Some evaluations concentrate on judging the accuracy of their systems, which emphasizes the capacity of prediction. However, some researchers argued that user satisfaction should be the eventual measuring criterion for recommender systems. Based on this point of view, commercial systems usually measure user satisfaction by sale numbers, while non-commercial systems make inquiries about users' satisfaction upon using these systems. Some methods of measurement have been proposed to evaluate the performance of Web news recommender systems with various motivations and goals. The number of times that users access recommended news menus is used by Lee and Park (2007) to evaluate their news recommender system for the mobile Web. Their recommender system 108

provides three types of news menu to users: categories, recommended, and current menus. The read article ratio by menu is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the system. Instead of using the click rate of menus, Li et al. (2010) use a click through rate (CTR) to evaluate their personalized news article recommender system. A CTR is the ratio of the number of users who click on an item and the number of times the item is delivered to users. They believe that an effective recommender system is able to improve the overall CTR. Chen et al. (2009) consider that the evaluation of the top 10, 20, and 30 recommended news items is more valuable than the average evaluation of overall news items. Therefore, they only provide news listening rates of the top 10, 20, and 30 recommended items to evaluate their phonic Web news recommender system. Bomhardt (2004) proposed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) driven personal recommender system for news Web sites, in which recall and precision rates are used to evaluate the overall prediction quality of the system. The SVM-driven recommender system can reach a precision rate up to 61.69% with the consideration of the top 30 recommended news items.

6.4.2 Sample Results
For the Web news recommender system presented in this chapter, the weights of terms have been computed by utilizing approximately 7000 Web pages from well-categorized Web news sources, which are used to automatically classify Web pages into twelve topic 109

categories. Test users' interest and preference models are constructed and updated by tracking and analyzing their navigational data. Example interest and preference models of a test are shown in Table 4.1 and Table 4.2, respectively. The Web news captured from several news Web sites are provided to test users based on their user models and the content and location of the news. In the experiments, news content was collected from Web sources of categorized news, such as CNN, CBC, and Yahoo News. Although news providers have classified the news items obtained from these Web sites, they are re-classified by the Web page classification method in order to consider the scalability issue of news sources including well-categorized and non-categorized content, except when the news items are used as the test information for identifying the trusted users. After the collected news is classified, the recommendation process presented in Section 6.3.2 is conducted based on a user's interest and preference models. Generally, a recommender system will present a user with only the part of the content that is determined to be relevant to the user. However, in the experiments, all collected news arranged according to the probability of recommendation scoring from high to low are presented to a user, which is for effectively evaluating the recommender system discussed in Section 6.4.1. Table 6.1 shows an example of the top 5 recommended news items for a Web user at a certain time.

6.4.3 Evaluation of the Proposed News Recommender System
In order to evaluate the proposed Web news recommender system, 12 participants were asked to surf the Internet for the purpose of building their interest and preference models. Then the news collected from news Web sites was organized by the probability of recommendation based on the participants' models. Over a period of 15 to 20 days, the 12 participants were asked to use the prototype system for rating the relevance of the recommended news items at least once a day. Since it was not practical for the participants to rate the relevance of all news items by reading through them, the participants were asked to view all the titles of the news items in the list, and then decide whether they were willing to read through an item of news. Therefore, the precision and recall rates can be calculated by analyzing the participants' rating. Assuming the system recommends Rnum pieces of news to a user, and the user rates Ircmd pieces of news from the recommended list as relevant content, while the user rates Irelevant pieces of news from 111

the entire list as relevant content, the precision and recall rates can be calculated by: Precision Rate = Ircmd / Rnum Recall Rate = Ircmd / Irelevant (6.4) (6.5)

Based on the average precision and recall rates obtained from the participants' rating, the precision-recall curve of the system is drawn in Figure 6.4, where the particular pair of precision and recall rates is indicated by a small filled square for each number of recommended items. It shows that the system performs at a good precision rate if the number of recommended items is set to 30 or below. The precision rate drops when the number of recommended items is increased, which also implies that the news content of interest to a user is more likely to appear at the top of the list.

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed CF integrated in the system, the precision rates of the system using two types of recommendation algorithms are calculated for a comparison study. In other words, based on the same rating data from the participants, the recommendation results generated by Equation (6.2) and Equation (6.3) are used to calculate the precision rate of the system, respectively. Figure 6.5 shows the comparison results of the precision rates with and without the proposed CF method. It can be noticed that the precision rate of the hybrid system is several percentage points higher than the content-based recommender system. Since the proposed CF method is developed for a large-scale recommender system, the performance of the CF method could be fairly evaluated if a large number of users interact with the system.

6.5 Summary
A hybrid recommender system for personalized recommendation of Web news to users has been presented. A user's navigational data is tracked and analyzed through a Web page auto-classifying process, which is used to construct and update the user's interest model. The hyperlinks extracted from the user's navigational history are used to build the user's preference model. Web news collected from various news sites is classified by the Web page classification method, and then the probability of recommendation is calculated for a user by matching the contents of news and the user's models. In addition, test information is sent to users in order to identify the trusted users, which is an attempt to improve the performance of the recommender system. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the hybrid recommender system for personalized recommendation of news from the Web for users. A solution of integrating user modeling, content-based filtering, and CF for a personalized recommender system has been proposed.

Chapter 7 Personalized E-Marketing

Electronic commerce (e-commerce) is a type of commerce that conducts the selling and purchasing of products and services over computer networks. The amount of global trade conducted electronically has grown extraordinarily with widespread internet usage. Canada's National Statistical Agency reported that "Canadians used the Internet in 2009 to place orders for goods and services valued at $15.1 billion, up from $12.8 billion in 2007" (Statistics Canada, 2010). Figure 7.1 shows the increasing trend in the value of online orders from 2005 to 2009 in Canada (Statistics Canada, 2010). Many companies have realized the importance of e-commerce and its many benefits. In order to effectively exploit this business model, several sub-fields of e-commerce have been studied recently, including electronic marketing (e-marketing), online transaction processing, supply chain, etc. E-marketing is the marketing model over the Internet. It has some advantages over traditional marketing, such as low cost, instant connection, and global targeting. However, since many e-commerce companies have a large number of customers, emarketing is challenged by how to effectively target customers. Personalization in e-

115

commerce and e-marketing is an approach to offering personalized services to customers, which aims to improve the efficiency and targeting in e-commerce and e-marketing.

7.1 Personalization in E-Commerce
In the context of an e-commerce or e-marketing strategy, personalization is the process of exclusively creating a tailored e-shopping experience for every customer or a specific group of customers (Adomavicius and Tuzhilin, 2005b). The ideal personalization scenario in e-commerce is that an e-shop knows the specific interests and needs of each customer, and can present the relevant products or services in its inventory to customers. 116

Table 7.1 shows the descriptions and comparison of general e-commerce and personalized e-commerce (Mulpuru et al., 2007).

7.1.1 Benefits of Personalization Personalization strategies have increasingly gained interests of retailers and researchers, owing to the benefits that are associated with personalized systems for e-commerce. A successful application of personalization can improve the performance of an e-commerce system in the perspectives of increasing sales and obtaining customer loyalty. Some benefits that are brought by personalization are described as follows (Goy et al., 2007). · Winning potential customers. When a consumer navigates into an e-shopping Web site, it is sometimes as the result of a Web link redirection. In most cases, a Web search engine may lead a consumer whilst querying for specific products, brands, types, or on-sale information. If the e-shopping site cannot capture the attention of this type of customer at the first place, it will lose potential customers because they will turn back to the search engine for other search results. However, a personalized e-commerce system may provide more information related to a user's intents and interests than her or her original expectation, which is helpful to win the customer in the competitive e-market place. · Increasing customer loyalty. The term "customer loyalty" is usually defined as a customer's behavior of repeatedly using a service or purchasing in a shop. There are many ways an e-shop can obtain customer loyalty that have a common goal: meet customer satisfaction as much as possible. When a customer's intents and interests are accurately modeled by a personalized 118

system, he or she may find the items of interest in the recommended list and be relieved from the time-consuming search on the Web. The experience on this customer-centric service can impress a customer with high-efficiency and convenience. Therefore, personalization is an important method to increase customer loyalty. It is also a crucial part of Customer Relationship Management (CRM), which is a research topic involving the improvement of customer loyalty by managing elements of the business relationship. · Decreasing marketing cost. For a business company, it always pursues a highefficiency of marketing investment versus benefit return. E-shops have spent more on online marketing approaches than ever before, such as email and payper-click advertisement. Obviously, the goal of placing advertisements is to receive more profit in return. A conventional method of marketing is to deliver information to either all customers or a random group of customers, which lacks targeting. On the contrary, the strategy of personalization aims to classify customers and present the relative information to customers. Apparently, it can avoid unnecessary marketing investment and increase the ratio of return over cost. · Increasing sales. Based on the three benefits aforementioned, it can be seen that the strategy of personalization can help an e-shop by winning potential customers, keeping loyal customers, and efficiently placing advertisements. In other words, an e-shop can attract and satisfy customers by applying

119

personalization. Generally, an e-shop can increase sales benefiting from the increasing amount of customers and efficient recommendation method.

7.1.2 Personalized E-Commerce Models Currently, internet shops have become an integral part of people's everyday life and an important marketing channel for retailers. Online retailers take advantage of the Internet for its relatively low costs, instant response, and easy establishment (Roland and Kannan, 2003). The strategy of personalization is usually adopted to e-commerce, because it can improve system efficiency and increase sales. However, some difficulties of effectively applying personalization to e-commerce systems are challenging online retailers and researchers. One of the obstacles is how to filter redundant information. A personalized system can track a user's navigational data by various means, such as with an internet cookie, navigational record, survey, and purchase history. Although a user's interests can be modeled by analyzing the collected personal data, the redundant information in the collection may decrease the accuracy of the user models. For example, during a customer's navigational session, the pop-up pages should be considered the redundant information. The second difficulty is how to follow a user's behavior and update his or her models promptly. A customer's data is always changed continuously for many reasons. Some of these changes are related to their interests of purchase, which is important for a personalized e-commerce system. Online retailers need to find an effective method to monitor a user's data and keep it updated. The third difficulty is how 120

to identify a user's intents and interests. As discussed in Chapter 3, there are two types of user modeling approaches: explicit and implicit methods. Since it is not practical to ask a customer for his or her intents every time when he or she browses an e-shop, implicit methods are usually adopted in e-commerce systems. Therefore, e-shops and researchers are challenged by how to predict a customer's likely future purchases according to previous and current navigational data. Personalization in e-commerce applications can be discussed from several aspects, such as how to acquire personal information, how to provide a personal interface, how to cluster customers, and how to match products to user models. Table 7.2 shows several software technologies of how to interact with customers and acquire personal information (Wu et al., 2003). The method of explicit profiles is usually used in personalized services that require only a small amount of personal information. Cookies are used to identify a customer or a machine in the Web. Personal tools are usually provided in portal Web sites and Web trading systems. And the method of tracking a user's navigation is widely used in implicit-based Web systems, such as recommender systems, e-shops, and streaming video services.

121

Table 7.2 Interaction models of personalized e-commerce systems

Explicit Profiles

Customers are asked to register and provide personal information such as shipping address, interests, etc. to e-commerce Web sites. A customer's personal information is stored in a Web server. Therefore, e-shops can use user profiles for personalized services.

Cookies

Web cookies, also known as browser cookies in Web applications, are small pieces of text document stored in customers' local machines. A cookie is sent as an HTTP header by a Web server to a customer's local machine. It can be used for identifying customers, and storing site preferences, shopping cart contents, or any information that can be utilized by a personalized ecommerce system.

Personal Tools

Some Web sites provide personal tools to users, which allows users to create personalized services or interfaces themselves. For example, in Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com), customers can use the provided tools to set up their pages containing links of personal interest.

Navigational

When a customer browses an e-commerce Web site, his or her navigational

History in Servers data in the Web site can be tracked by the server. Some implicit-based personalized systems utilize the tracked navigational data to build users' models. For example, Amazon (www.amazon.com) tracks a customer's navigation in the Web site, so that it can recommend related items to the customer based on the viewed products.

122

An e-commerce Web site has many features and components, such as Web addresses, interfaces, and content. Therefore, personalization can be implemented to an ecommerce system through different approaches. Link personalization is an approach to insert additional relevant links for a user. In this approach, a user can generate links directing to the contents of interest in a Web site. Figure 7.2 shows an example of link personalization that is applied at the Excite! Web site. Interface personalization is an approach to customizing the page display for a user. Using the personal tool provided by a Web site, a user can adjust topics, frame size, frame location, font type, font size, color template, background, etc. Figure 7.3 shows an example of interface personalization applied at the Google Web site. Since content is one of the most important features for an e-commerce system, content personalization attracts a lot of attention in e-commerce. The purpose of content personalization is to provide optimized information or products for users based on user profiles or models. Similar to the filtering techniques of news recommender introduced in Chapter 6, three filtering methods are employed in content personalization: content-based, collaborative, and hybrid filtering. Figure 7.4 gives an example of content personalization using the hybrid method in the YouTube Web site. In YouTube, when a user opens a streaming video, the relative video clips with high numbers of clicks are promoted to the user.

7.2 E-Marketing
E-marketing has been recognized and utilized as an important facet of marketing due to its inherent advantages such as low costs, speedy implementation, and easy customer tracking. There are several mediums in which e-marketing can be facilitated: telephone, radio, television, and the Internet. In this dissertation, only internet based e-marketing is considered and discussed. Compared to traditional marketing, e-marketing has the following properties: 125

1. The delivery of information, services, and products is completely or partially through the Internet. 2. Electronic payment is usually adopted by e-marketing systems. 3. The technologies towards automatic transactions and procedures are usually utilized in e-marketing systems. 4. E-marketing systems can be easily expanded. In other words, e-marketing can be defined as the technology of using electronic mediums such as the Internet to achieve marketing and promotion objectives. The speedy internet-based interactions between e-marketing systems and customers make it possible to achieve high efficiency for the systems and satisfy customer needs. Generally, any online service can be coupled with an e-marketing system, for instance: e-mails, Web sites, bulletin boards, instant message systems, etc. The email-based e-marketing systems have been used widely because of their effective targeting. A customer is more likely to view the contents in his or her email inbox than the contents from any other information source. Nevertheless, the email-based e-marketing systems are criticized for the pervasive email scams and spam. With the rapid progress of e-business and e-commerce, Web site based e-marketing, especially the e-shopping site-based e-marketing, has played an important role in e-business systems. Amazon is a great example of an e-shopping company that successfully incorporated the technique of e-marketing into their shopping Web sites. Figure 7.5 shows a partial screenshot of Amazon Web site. 126

Figure 7.5 A partial screenshot of Amazon Web site

The screenshot of the Amazon Web site presents some progress and trends of current emarketing systems: 1. The personalization of e-marketing is pursued for a better customer targeting. 2. Both customers and products are classified for the personalization of emarketing.

127

3. Both content-based and collaborative-based filtering methods are utilized for e-marketing systems. 4. The criteria of matching a customer's needs to products can be based on diverse attributes, such as price, brand, function, etc. It can also be observed that such e-marketing systems are item-centric, because the classification of customers is based on the items viewed by customers. Such emarketing systems ignore the process of modeling a customer's long-term interests and preferences. Instead, the systems only derive a customer's interest model as his or her recently viewed items. This method can simplify the design of the e-marketing systems and decrease the computational burden. However, it will also decrease the effectiveness of the e-marketing systems and may not satisfy a customer's needs. Therefore, a model of personalized e-marketing system based on a customer's long-term interest model is introduced in this chapter.

7.3 Customer Classification for E-Marketing
The proposed personalized e-marketing framework has four components: determining a customer's general interest model, determining a customer's local browsing model, classifying Web customers, and creating a personalized marketing plan for e-commerce (Wen et al., 2009). Figure 7.6 shows the main steps of the proposed framework.

7.3.1 Customer Interest Modeling The generation of a customer's interest model is based on the user modeling method discussed in Chapter 4. The process of building a Web user's interest model can be divided into the following three steps: 1. Tracking the user's navigational data,

129

2. Using the cumulative weight to determine the content of the user's browsed Web pages, and 3. Employing the Naïve Bayes model to update the user's interest model. 7.3.2 User Local Browsing Modeling The proposed approach aims to develop a general personalized e-commerce model, which implies that this work will not be limited to a single type of Web service system. However, in order to eliminate descriptive complexity and confusion, the case of an internet shop is used as the main platform in this research. The products in an internet shop can be represented in a two layer set: [j1[P11, P12, ..., P1m, ...], j2[P21, P22, ..., P2m, ...], ..., jn[Pn1, Pn2, ..., Pnm, ...], ...], where jn is the nth category, and Pnm means the mth product in the nth category. Through monitoring a Web customer's behavior and navigational history on the internet shop, the customer's browsing model regarding the internet shop can be represented as uk[[j1[P11(T, B), P12(T, B), ..., P1m(T, B), ...], j2[P21(T, B), P22(T, B), ..., P2m(T, B), ...], ..., jn[Pn1(T, B), Pn2(T, B), ..., Pnm(T, B), ...], ...], where uk represents Web customer k, and Pnm(T, B) is the statistical result showing the overall time customer uk has spent browsing product Pnm and the number of times that customer uk has bought product Pnm from the internet shop within a certain period of time.

130

7.3.3 Customer Classification for E-Commerce Applying personalized e-commerce requires classifying customers based on customers' unique behaviors and needs. Therefore, it is a crucial issue for an internet shop to identify a Web customer's implicit objectives when the customer is browsing the shop's Web site. Based on the customer interest model and the customer local browsing model described earlier, a method for classifying a customer for e-commerce is proposed, which can be formulated as:
np j

dpp(u k ) =

jSC

 ( DU ( j ) /(1 - ln

T
k =1

j ,k

T

) * (1 +  B j , k ))
k =1

np j

(7.1)

CG ( req ) = {uk  U : reqmin  dpp (uk ) < reqmax }

(7.2)

where dpp(uk) is the degree of potential purchase (DPP) on the Web site for customer uk; SC is the set of categories; DU(j) is the degree of customer's interest on category j; npj is the overall number of products in category j on the internet shop; T is a constant representing a certain period of time; Tj,k is the total time that customer uk has spent on browsing product k in category j during period T; Bj,k is the number of times that customer uk has purchased product k in category j; req represents a range of degrees for a potential purchase; CG(req) is the set of customers satisfying the certain requirement of customers' DPP; reqmin is the minimal value of req; reqmax is the maximal value of req; and U is the set of all customers. 131

Equation (7.1) is used to determine a Web customer's DPP on an internet shop. A higher dpp(uk) implies a higher possibility that customer k would like to purchase a product on the internet shop. Equation (7.2) shows the method of classifying customers based on grading their degree of potential purchase.

7.4 Personalized E-Marketing Planning
After a Web customer's degree of potential purchase on an internet service provider has been estimated, a personalized marketing plan for e-commerce becomes feasible. An online service company can develop a Web-marketing strategy based on its own circumstances and the customer modeling. As far as an internet shop is concerned, its business objectives are: making profit, occupying the market, attracting customers, and expanding the company. Therefore, a series of e-marketing and promotion plans based on the customer modeling can be drawn up in order to maximize profit and increase marketing impact. Table 7.3 gives a brief example of an e-marketing and promotion strategy based on the proposed Web-user modeling for an internet shop. The intention of the personalized plan is either to increase sales or to promote the internet shop itself by increasing the Web customer's browsing time on the Web site.

132

high degree of potential providing on-sale information. purchase Customer with relatively Providing on-sale information; promoting the Web

low degree of potential site by showing entertaining products. purchase Customer with low degree Emphasis on promoting the Web site by showing of potential purchase entertaining products.

7.5 Evaluation Criteria
In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed work, some evaluation criteria are presented in this section. According to the structure of the proposed framework, it is obvious that the accuracy of user classification and the effectiveness of the personalized e-marketing planning determine the overall performance of the proposed system.

133

The degree of potential purchase only describes a Web customer's likely behavior in an internet shop, which means its accuracy can never be confirmed because the future statistical data of customers can never be obtained. Therefore, this work proposes a method to indirectly evaluate the performance of user classification. If no personalized emarketing plan is applied, 20% of customers with the highest and lowest DPP are tracked and analyzed in their respective time intervals. A simple equation is given to represent the accuracy of the user classification:

Au =

phigh × (1 - plow )

(7.3)

where Au indicates the accuracy of the user classification; phigh is the purchase rate of the customers with high DPP; and plow is the purchase rate of the customers with low DPP. In terms of the personalized marketing planning, its performance can be assessed by using the fusion of component comparison. The customers' navigational data recorded in two consecutive time slices, with and without personalized marketing planning, is employed to make a comparison. The effectiveness of personalized marketing planning over normal marketing planning is given by

E pm =  6 (

Np N np

- 1) +  7 (

Ip I np

- 1) + 8 (

Tp Tnp

- 1)

(7.4)

where Epm represents the effectiveness of the personalized marketing planning; Np is the total number of customers who purchase any product during the personalized marketing 134

time slice; Nnp is the total number of customers who purchase any product during the normal marketing time slice; Ip is the total number of items sold during the personalized marketing time slice; Inp is the total number of items sold during the normal marketing time slice; Tp is the overall browsing time by all customers during the personalized marketing time slice; Tnp is the overall browsing time by all customers during the normal marketing time slice; and 6, 7 and 8 are factors of importance corresponding to customer, product, and brand implanting respectively, which are determined by the company's long term and short term strategies.

7.6 Experimental Results
The proposed framework is a type of e-commerce model combined with Web user classification. Extensive experiment results and evaluation results can only be achieved by collaborating with an industrial company. Limited by practical conditions, this research only presents some experiment results in a simulation environment. Assume the Web site http://www.ebay.ca is an internet shop embedded with the proposed user classification module. The following experiment results show the performance of the proposed method through monitoring a user's buying activities. First, the user's general interest model is acquired through the work introduced in Chapter 4. The user's degrees of interest on some categories are shown in Table 7.4.

135

By using the internet monitor program, the user's navigational data has been recorded. It shows that the user has spent 5 hours in 3 days browsing projector items that belong to the electronics category. Therefore, the user's local browsing model related to the electronics category can be determined, as shown in Figure 7.7.

Though the experiment results for the proposed personalized marketing strategy is unable to be provided due to limited experiment conditions, it is still shown that a Web customer is able to be effectively classified only if a group of deliberate thresholds matching the internet shop are determined.

7.7 Summary
A framework to classify a Web customer based on the customer's general interest model and local browsing model has been presented. A customer's interest model is built based 137

on the work presented in Chapter 4. By monitoring the user's navigational behavior at an internet shop, the user's local browsing model represented by browsing time and the number of items bought is identified. A Web user classification method is proposed, which aims to identify more potential customers for an online service company. A sample of a personalized e-marketing strategy is also presented in this work. In the experiment, a customer's navigational data on eBay is examined and analyzed using the proposed user classification method. The experiment results show that the proposed method can classify customers. The proposed model can be potentially integrated with personalized online services. However, future work is necessary to extend testing of the proposed approach. A commercial Web service would be ideal for examining the performance of the proposed model.

Chapter 8 Conclusions and Future Research

Web personalization is a process that provides customized online services using user profiles. Many research topics such as Web page classification, user modeling, and system integration are related to Web personalization. The overall goals of conducting personalization within online services are to satisfy a user's specific needs, save a user's time and effort, and improve the performance of systems. Due to the variety of online services, the approaches to Web personalization vary in different circumstances. However, most personalized Web systems more or less share the same structure and components, because they all need to determine a user's needs, classify products, and perform the process of matching products with their needs.

8.1 Main Contributions of the Dissertation
The overall contribution of this dissertation is the development of three Web personalization systems: a personalized search system, a personalized Web news recommender, and a personalized e-marketing system. Contributions are made in the 139

research areas of Web page classification, user modeling, and system integration, as summarized below. A framework of Web page classification based on three different features is presented in this dissertation. In the preprocessing step, terms determined according to an ontology database are weighted using a TF/IDF method. Then, the proposed classification approach uses directory service, meta information, and content information for classifying Web pages separately. A fusion method is used to re-classify Web pages based on the results given by the three separate classifiers. In the experiments, the proposed method is applied to automatically classify Web pages into five categories. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively classify some types of Web pages, such as news and shopping Web pages. However, the performance of the proposed classification method is decreased when the Web pages contain heavy noisy information. Nevertheless, the proposed classification method can be used for the online services that require unsupervised Web page categorization. A method to building and updating a user's models of interests and preferences based on the user's Web navigational data is developed. Using the proposed Web page classification method, Web pages viewed by a user are mapped to categories based on certain topics. A user's models of interests and preferences are updated using the Naïve Bayes model. In the experiments, the proposed method is utilized to determine what category topics a user may be interested in, and what information sources the user prefers

140

to retrieve information from. The experimental results show that a user's model of interests and preferences can be effectively built by the proposed method. A personalized Web search system using both Web content-based and behaviorbased modeling approaches is proposed. For the purpose of this research, a user's search context model is constructed according to the user's click-through during a search session. Through analyzing a user's search context information, the proposed system determines how the user's interest and preference models influence his or her search behavior. Then, by computing the ranking score of a Web page based on the user models, a re-ranking algorithm is developed. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed personalized search approach. A hybrid recommendation system utilizing both content-based and collaborative filtering for recommending Web news is presented. The proposed Web page classification method is applied to classify collected Web news from various Web sites. By calculating the similarity between a user model and the content of a news item, the probability of recommending the news to the user is determined. In order to improve the performance of the system, a method of determining trusted users is utilized. In the process, test information is sent to users, which is used to identify trusted users by their responses. Therefore, this work proposes a solution of integrating user modeling, contentbased filtering, and collaborative filtering for a personalized recommendation system. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid recommender system for recommending Web news. 141

A framework to classify a Web customer based on the customer's general interest model and local browsing model is proposed. A customer's interest model is built by using the Web page classification and user modeling approaches developed in this dissertation. By monitoring the user's navigational behavior at an internet shop, the user's local browsing model represented by browsing time and the number of items purchased is identified. A Web customer classification method is proposed, which aims to attract more potential customers for the e-commerce company. A sample personalized e-marketing strategy is also presented. In the experiment, a customer's navigational data on eBay is examined and analyzed using the proposed customer classification method. The experiment results show that the proposed method can classify the customers correctly. The proposed model can be potentially integrated with the personalized online service systems.

8.2 Future Research
There are some limitations observed in this research. Further study is necessary to improve the proposed approaches. In the approaches of Web page classification and user modeling, more categories and classes should be considered to describe Web pages and user interests. Since the Internet is a very large repository of diverse data and information, the performance of the Web page classification approach can only be thoroughly investigated when a more 142

comprehensive category system is used. For instance, if a category is not included in the category index, the Web pages relevant to this category have to be classified into other categories, which affects the precision and recall rates. For the same reason, the category structure of the user modeling method needs to be extended in the future research. In the user modeling approach, other updating algorithms can be investigated to compare with the Naïve Bayes algorithm. Although the calculation of a user's models is subjective, different updating algorithms can be compared with respect to the computational burdens, time to boundary, robustness, etc. In an environment with high scalabilities of users and data, an algorithm that can estimate user models efficiently and effectively is necessary. Experiments with more participants are needed to demonstrate the performance of the personalized Web search, news recommender and e-marketing systems. To a system whose performance is meant to be evaluated by users, the number of participants is one of the most important experimental factors. The experimental results can be more convincing if more users test and evaluate the systems. In order to investigate the practical value of the personalized e-marketing model, it is necessary to integrate the model into a pilot or commercial system. The purposes of any e-commerce model are to serve customers better and increase profit for companies. If an internet shop can test the proposed personalized e-marketing model, advantages and limitations of the model can be thoroughly investigated.
