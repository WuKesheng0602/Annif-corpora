Abstract Signal Analysis of Sleep Electrooculogram
@Peyman Shokrollahi, 2009 Master of Applied Science Electrical and Con1puter Engineering Ryerson University

1\!Ieasures of sleep physiology, not obvious to the hun1an eye, may provide in1portant clues to disease states, and responses to therapy. A significant a1nount of eye 1noven1ent data is not attended to clinically in routine sleep studies because these data are too long, about six to eight hours in duration, and they are also mixed with n1any unknown artifacts usually produced from EEG signals or other activities. This research describes how eye n1ovements were different in depressed patients who used antidepressant rnedications, cornpared to those who did not. The goal is to track antidepressant rnedications' effects on sleep eye n1ovements. Clinically used SSRis such as Prozac (Fluoxetine), Celexa (Citalopra1n), Zoloft (Sertraline), the SNRI Effexor (Venlafaxine) have been considered in this study to assess the possible connections between eye n1ovements recorded during sleep and serotonin activities. The novelty of this research is in the assess1nent of sleep eye n1ovements, in order to track the antidepressant n1edications' effects on the brain through EOG channels. EOG analysis is valuable because it is a noninvasive n1ethod, and the following research is looking for findings that are invisible to the eyes of professional clinicians. This thesis focuses on quantifying sleep eye n1ovements, with two techniques: autoregressive 1nodeling and wavelet analysis. The eye movement detection software (EJ\!IDS) with 1nore than 1500 lines was developed for detecting sleep eye n1ovements. AR coefficients were derived from the sleep eye n1ovements of the patients who were exposed to antidepressant medications, and those who were not, and then they are classified by n1eans of linear discriininant analysis. Also for wavelet analysis, discrete wavelet coefficients have been used for classifying sleep eye moven1ents of the patients who were exposed to medication and those who were not.

Chapter 1 Introduction

H

UiviAN beings spend about one··third of their lives sleeping, a necessary part of existence which includes a variety of unique physiological states. The suspension of

consciousness and the experience of drean1ing have been discussed a1nong physicians, philosophers, and poets for centuries. Furthennore, in the last three decades, acadernic studies on sleep have found a large nu1nber of connections between sleep and physical and n1ental wellbeing. In this regard, neurologists and psychiatrists are n1ore interested in sleep studies than other scientists because of the invaluable physiological infonna.tion that exists in sleep data recordings, including electroencephalographic (EEG), electrooculogra.phic (EOG), and electron1yographic (El\:IG) recordings, captured in routine sleep
studi~_,._-,.

In order to have a

better understanding of sleep data recordings, doctors and sleep experts receive extensive

training to be sufficiently qualified in sleep data analysis. However, there is a wealth of
physiological infonnation that is not hnmediately apparent and is not readily available. Signal acquisition technology is able to gather an extensive database of sleep recordings. EEG, EOG , ECG, E:JMG, and other channels record the electrical activity of the brain, eyes, heart, n1usdes, and other organs during sleep. These types of two-din1ensional signals, representing voltage variations over thne, show the physiological activity of different organs. Furthermore, each channel includes extensive infonnation, and the study of each channel needs broad research. Thus, mnong all channels, EOG signals, which repre.'3ent eye n1overnent activity, have been chosen for this research.

During recent years: the rnedical industry has better understanding of sleep disorder problmns. The n1edical industry has helped to alleviate sleep disturbances, reduce their side

effects, and enhance rnedications to increase the duration of sleep. These in1prove1nents
are reflected in the frequent publications about sleep n1edications, as well the availability of

rnedications that may have effects on sleep. Antidepressant rnedications are a.nwng those which 1nay have extensive effects. This
resE~arch

concerns antidepressant 1nedications'

efl(~cts

on eye movernents recorded in EOG signals during sleep. This chapter is divided into following sections: sleep, neurotra.nsrnitter function in controlling n10od, depression and risk factors in sleep deprivation; antidepressant n1edications, eye 1novernent, n1otivation, contribution, and outline of the thesis.

Sleep is known to be governed by the diencephalon, which is the area in the centre of the brain just above the brain stein. Sleep is characterized by cyclic, "reversible loss of consciousness, reduced sensory and rnotor functions linking the brain with the environn1ent, internally generated rhythn1idty and a restorative quality that cannot be achieved [otherwise]" [1]. In 1868, Greisinger discovered eye movernents during sleep. Freud's suggestion, acting out of drearns, predicted the discovery of n1usde paralysis during Rapid Eye l\!Iovetuent sleep. The report by Aserinsky and Kleitrnan explained the existence of "regularly occurring periods of eye rnotility during sleep" that were associated ·with drea.rning. They described the occtuTence of the repetitive cycles which are called rapid eye rnoven1ents (REl\II) and non-rapid eye rnovernent (NR.E:tvf}. In 1953, it was discovered that llEl\!1 sleep has a cyclic pattern in sleep. Before this investigation, some investigators had suspected that two states of sleep existed (1]. These studies led to a solution for 1nany sleep problerns. l\llore than 50 rnilHon An1erica.ns suffer fron1 soine fonn of a sleep disorder. The disorder of sleep and wakefulness hinders daily functions, and a.tTects health and longevity [2].Sleep research is one of the topics in research by which the quality of hurnan life can be irnproved. In this regard, a great deal of data a.nalysis in sleep-related n1aterials exists, sueh as tin1e-

3 frequency analysis of sleep [3], sleep time duration [4], sleep apnea analysis [5] [6] [7] , sleep
EEG analysis [8) [9) [10), and sleep EEG-ECG analysis [11).

1.1.1

Sleep Recording

Sleep recordings are categorized into NREM and REM sleep state. Each state has unique physiological characteristics including: variations in brain wave patterns, eye movements, and muscle tone. Polysomnography (a sleep study) captures this information with EEG , EOG , and EMG recordings. While sleep clinicians use this information in clinical management , there is a wealth of information that is not apparent to casual visual inspection [12). Figure 1.1 represents a sample of polysomnography including EEG , EOG , EMG, ECG and other channels.

Figure 1.1: Polysomnography Including EEG, EOG, EMG and Other Channels

Polysomnography is also used to assess normal and abnormal sleep patterns, sleep stages,

4 and wakefulness. Furthennore, cha.raeteristics of recorded data include Inuch unknown infor-

Ination. Quantitative n1ethods such as Fast Fourier Transfonn {FFT) , wavelet transforrns,

and digital .filters are also used for further assessinent to characterize these biological signals. As a rule, a. bio-signal changes in a very con1plicated rna.nner, and it is cHfiicult, even for specialists, to extract useful infonnation directly fron1 raw da.ta.. Therefore, a cornputer assisted method was required for further assessn1ent of these data [13].

Sleep Stages
Slc·ep stages are defined by using EEC::, EOG, and E!VIG features. In the 1960s, the need

for standardized quantitative assessn1ent of sleep to facilitate research and clinical eva.luation led to the publication of the AAS:NI 1nanua.l for the scoring of sleep and associated events [2] that is still used today. Although sleep study is categorized as NREl\!I and R.EI\1
sleep, NRE1V1 sleep is classified into further categories, Stages 1-4, by the help of different

polysornnogra.phic analyses considering that each state has unique physiological cha.ra.eteristics including variations in brain wave patterns, eye 1novexnents, and n1uscle tone.

Most Prominent Features of The Stages
Stage categories for scoring epochs are as follows: · VVakefulness - Recognized by existing low voltage and high frequency signals in EEG channels; · 1\!Iovernent Tirne Recognized by scoring epoch during which the EEG signal is obscured by rnovernents of the subject;
o Stage 1

Recognized by a relatively higher voltage and lower frequency than wakefulness in EEG signals with slow eye rnovexnents;

5

· Stage 2 Recognized by a relatively higher voltage and lower frequency than Stage 1 in EEG signals with the presence of a special wavefonn in EEG called the K-co1nplex and sleep spindles; · Stages 3 and 4 Recognized by 1noderate a:1.nounts of high a1nplitude with slow wave activity, known as deep sleep;
· REI\11
~

Recognized by the presence of rapid eye rnovernents in EOG channels with low voltage and high frequency wavefonns in EEG;

Sleep scoring is one of the topics in which much research has been conducted. The following publications are important in this regard for automatic sleep scoring [14] [15] [16], Stage 2 scoring [17], scoring through non-invasive 111ethods [18] [19], the classification of sleep stages [20] [21] [22], and sleep rnonitoring [23}. Furthermore, due to the importance of sleep data acquisition, one of the main topics in sleep research is instru1nentation and sensor developrnent. Also, various signal processing techniques such as filtering analysis [24], wavelet analysis [25], 1nultifractal analysis [26], and autoregressive n1odelling [27] have been used in sleep literature. 1\tiost of the techniques 1nentioned have been perfonned on EEG signals.

EOG channels of polysom.nography in which the signals were recorded for this study \\rere considered. The EOG records the potential difference between the cornea and the retina. The eyeball is a dipole, with a positive pole at the cornea and a negative pole at the retina. Figure 1.2 represents the polarity of the eye.

Figure 1.2: The Polarity of the Eye

By the rotation of the eye globe, the cornea moves with respect to the electrodes placed near the eyes. If the eye (cornea) moves toward an electrode, it will induce a positive

potential in the electrode and if the eye moves away, it will induce negative potential in the electrode. Therefore, for recording the horizontal and vertical eye movements the electrodes are placed diagonally [13]. Recordings of eye movements from three EOG and two reference channels with the routine polysomnographic recording were used in this work. The sampling rate is 128 samples per second. The AC channels are as follows:
· LOC: a signal that is recorded by the electrode placed 1cm below and 1cm left of the

left eye of the subject;
· ROC: a signal that is recorded by the electrode placed 1cm above and 1cm to the

right of the right eye of the subject;
· VOC: a signal that is recorded by an electrode placed 1cm below the middle of the

right eye of the subject;

· Mastoid Signals ( Al, A2): signals recorded by .an electrode placed on a bony surface

7

and used as a reference. To remove artifacts from EOG signals, processing and analysis are performed on signal differences between an EOG signal and references as follows: LOC-A2, ROC-Al , and VOC-Al, which are referred to as EOG signals in this research. Sleep staging was provided, using the routine scoring methods [2]. Figure 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 demonstrate the placements of the electrodes on the subject. EOG signals recorded with this configuration at the sleep lab of Sunnybrook Health Science Centre were used in this research.

Neurotransmitter Function in Controlling Mood

Figure 1.6 shows how an action potential moves from one neuron to another, and how two neurons communicate with each other through neurotransmitters. A neurotransmitter molecule communicates (information) through synaptic cells. It exchanges the signals from a presynaptic neuron to the postsynaptic neuron. Transmitters are packed in vesicles docking at the presynaptic terminals. At arrival, the electric impulse, called action potential,

9 durnps the neurotransn1itter in the docked vesicles into the synaptic cleft, the gap between presynaptic and postsynaptic neuron. The receptors on the postsynaptic neuron receive the neurotransrnitters [28]. Neurotransnlitters play a great role in controlling the rnood regularities. The irregularities in their transtnission can cause several diseases in hurnans, such as depression.

Depression and Risk Factors in Sleep Deprivation

Depression is linked to lower levels of neurotransrnitters, especially serotonin. :Nla.ny organizations and educational progrmns ha:ve atte1npted to increase public awareness about depression. The US Depression Awareness Recognition and Treahnent Progrmn, the UK Defeat Depression Carnpaign, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, and the Royal College of General Practitioners-Health and \Vork Training are muong these progran1s and organizations

[29} [30]. Psychiatric depression is considered to be one of the rnore con1mon and

treatable 1nental disorders [31]. The statistics show that the the average lifethne risk of depression is between 4% to 12%i for 1nales and 12% to 26% for ferna.les [32] [33] [34). Depression is 1nore connnon runong the elderly population, due to additional risk factors such as physical disability, lower income, cognitive hnpainnent, and lack of social support [35] [34]. Furthennore, depression in elderly people is harder to n1a.nage if there is concurrent physical illness. Also, for many patients, it is required to Inaintain their long-tenn, even lifetilne, antidepressant 1naintenance therapy [36). Depression treatments with fevver side effects are required, and these effects are rninilnized when patients are \vell infonned [34]. lV1ost patients with depression have sleep disturbances that n1ay be acco1npanied by excessive sleeplessness, known as insornnia. The characteristics of sleep disturbance in patients with depression includes short RE1\II sleep latency on all-night polyson1nography and an
increa.~ed

REfvl density. Depression can be treated in n1any ways; one of them is antide-

pressant medication such as Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRis) and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRis), which vvill be discussed in the next section in detail [37].

Antidepressant Medications

10

Sleep disorders often require assessrnent in a sleep laboratory. They frequently coexist with other rnedieal and psychiatric conditions (e.g. ca.rdiovascular disease, depression, or diabetes) as well as different Inedication exposures (Le.: hannful effects).
~Iany

sleep state changes

have been seen in clinical depression (i.e reduced activity) and with respect to 1nedication exposures [~38]. \Vhile REl\ti sleep eye n1ovmnents have been of historical interest to clinieians, son1e interesting eye n1oven1ents are noted in NRE!vi sleep after exposure to antidepressant rr1edications such as Prozac [39] [40]. A way to quantify sleep eye rnove1nent changes rna.y help detect patterns of physiology and response to treatn1ent that have not been apparent to clinicians so faT. The 1nain group of rnedications that have been used in this research are the SSRls and SNRis. SSRis are referred to as a phannacologically hornogeneous group. They represent only differences in serotonin reuptake inhibitory potency. On the other hand, they have different
effects on netlrotransmitter rt.x·eptors and pharrnaeokinetic profiles, \vhieh is related to the

rate of uptaking a drug [41].
1~4~1

Antidepressant Medication Develop:tnent

In late 1950s, the first effective antidepressant xnedications, monoa.1nine oxidase inhibitors (l\!lAOis) and the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), were launched to the phannades. However these agents have been lh11ited in clinical applications, due to their different side effects and "pren1a.ture discontinuation of therapy" [34] [42]. Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRis) is the new class of antidepressant n1edications which has beco1ne available in the past few years. They are as effective as TCAs with fewer side effects. Ftuthennore, it should be 1nentioned that they are not "perfect" antidepressants; they have side effects, they do not work im111ediately, and they do not work for all patients. However, they enhance the phannacotherapy of depression significantly [84}.

11

1.4.2

SSRis and SNRis Mechanism of action

Although SSRis do not bind to any specific neuroreceptor system, they produce antidepressant effects through the selective blockade of serotonin re-uptake [43] . Re-uptake of serotonin, after its release into the cleft, stops the neuron activity (see Figure 1.6) .

lmpuls~ - - - Presynaptic Neuron

Transmitters
Synaptic Cleft

- - - - Postsynaptic Activity

Figure 1.6: The Procedure of the Communication between two Neurons by Neurotransmitters

A serotonin re-uptake carrier is responsible for its re-uptake through the cellular membrane. Inhibition of the serotonin uptake carrier makes the serotonin concentration increase in the synapse [44}. By increasing the concentration of serotonin in the synaptic cleft through inactivation of presynaptic autoreceptors, serotonergic (related to neurotransmitter serotonin) turnover is reduced. On the other hand, by increasing the amount of synaptic serotonin, presynaptic serotonin autoreceptors become desensitized. This action is accompanied by increased serotonin release and enhancement of serotonergic neurotransmission. However, this outcome does not occur immediately, and takes about 14 days after starting a treatment [45]. This observation is pertinent, because of the "delayed onset of antidepressant efficacy" in most cases [34].

12
SNRis con1prise a new class of antidepressant medications. SNRis are .developed fro1n

SSRis to affect not only serotonin, but also norepinephrine and other neurotra.ns1nitter systerns. These n1edications have sim.ilar functions to SSRis in which they inhibit the reuptake
of neurotransn1itters, vvhich have an effect on Inood [46].

Tables 1.1 and 1.2 show the generic and trade nan1es of SSRI's and SNRI's antidepressant
rnedications.

By reviewing sorne of the advantages and disa.dva.nta.ges of SSRI 1nedications, one can

understand that the SSRis are used for depression trea.tnwnt, and they were developed to

be as effE-'Ctive as reference medication, TCAs. One vvho is interested in this developrnent
can study Fluvoxa1nine(with trade na.rne of Luvox) [47}, Paroxetine(with tra.de name of Paxil) [48], Citalopram (with trade narne of Celex:a) [49], and Sertraline(with trade narne of

Zoloft) [50]. Also, advantages and disadvantages of SSRis are discussed in (34]. Further, the SSH.Is are eHective in the relief of sleep disturbance, within the depression eontext [34] [51]. The SSR.Is have other advantages and disadvantages which were not of eoneern to this research. r(x exarnple, they potentiate the effects of alcohol or son1e other drugs. One n1a.y
refer to [52] [53] for further infonnation.

1.5

Eye Movement

13

The study of eye movement is a source of information to both scientists and clinicians. Neurobiologists are interested in the study of eye movement, because the inspection of eye movements provides an opportunity to understand brain functionality. Ophthalmologists and neurologists are also interested in eye movement study because they can find clues to the localization of disease in the brain. Over the past thirty years, eye movements have been considered as a source of insight into different brain disorders [54] . Furthermore, it should be considered that unconscious eye movements during sleep are also a good source of information for clinicians, in order to track disease states and responses to therapy. This section talks about the basic elements of eye movements which are used in this thesis. Also, the publications which are mostly about eye movement analysis during wakefulness are considered. Eye movements are categorized into four types of movements: leftward, rightward, upward and downward as shown in Figures 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, and 1.10.

Figure 1.10: The Downward Eye Movement

Figures 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, and 1.14 represent the configuration of EOG channels for different types of movements. Furthermore, eye movement measurement during
wake~lness

is one of the most im-

portant topics in many research areas. Different types of analysis have been applied to

EOG signals, such as simple nonlinear deterministic processes [55], different types of algorithms, [56] [57], filtering [58], modelling of eye movements [59] [60]. Modelling of eye movements is categorized into special eye movements such as saccadic eye movements [61] [62] or vergence eye movements [63]. Machine learning [64] [65], analysis of eye movement dysfunctions, such as saccadic [66] [67] [68], vigilance [69], or quick phase [70], and human brain functionality [71] [72] [73] are important topics in the analysis of wakefulness eye movements. There are many publications on eye movement tracking [74] [75] [76] and removing eye movements from EEG as artifacts [77].

EOG is also important in human computer interactions [78] [79] [80]. Further, EOG is
· used directly in control systems [81]. Some of the methods-are used for processing visual motion .in animals [82] or for analysis of human eye [83]. Different kinds of control and

1. 6

Motivation
1noven1ent data is not attended to clinically in routine sleep

A significant cunount of

studies because these data are too long, about six to eight hours in duration, and they are also rnixed with 1nany unknown artifacts usually produced fro1n EEG signals or other activities. J\!Ieasures of sleep physiology, not obvious to the hurnan eye, may provide hnportant clues to disea...-,e states, and responses to therapy. For exarnple, it ha.'3 been noted that eye n1overnents change significantly in the patients exposed to antidepressant 1nedications. This research describes how eye n1ove1nents were different in depressed patients who used antidepressant medications, compared to those who did not. The goal is to track antidepressant rnedications' effects on sleep eye m.ove1nents. Clinically used SSRis such as Prozac, Celexa, Zoloft, the SNRI Effexor have been considered in this study to assess the possible connections between eye n1ove1nents recorded during sleep and serotonin activities. The novelty of this research is in the assess1nent of sleep eye 1novements, in order to track the antidepressant r.oedicat.ions'
(~ffects

on the brain through EOG channels.

EOG analysis is valuable because it is a noninvasive method, and the folluw·ing research is looking for findings that are invisible to the eyes of professional clinicians. Discovering an
a~sociation

between the two classes of patients (exposed and unexposed to

n1edica.tion) is an hnportant step in biornedical signal analysis applied to medication effects. However, why and how these two classes are related in sleep eye n1ovenwnts should not be lhnited to this research; they need further research in the future.

Chapter 2
Autoregressive Modelling and Wavelet Analysis Theories

I

N this chapter the theories behind the n1ethods used in sleep eye movetnent analysis are discussed. Autoregressive (AR) n1odelling and wavelet analysis are the main Inatheinat-

ical techniques used in this research. Signal n1odelling is an ilnportant 1nethod which can be used in a va.r.iety of fields, including biornedical engineering. .l\lodelling of a bionwdical signal is important for distinguishing abnonnalities in the wavefonn of the signaL In son1e areas such as heart signals (eleetrocardiograrn [ECG]), the ·wavefonn has a known shape; however, in other areas such as sleep eye rnovernents, it does not. There is trenwndous an10unt of infonnation buried in eleetrooculograrn (EOG) that is unknown to dinicians. Any new inforrnation that can be extracted fro1n this signal can help neurologists and psychiatrists in their diagnostic or therapeutic analyses. Therefore, possible rnethods for n1odelling of EOG signals were considered in this research. If it is possible to model a signal accurately with a srnall nu1nber of parameters

k, where k is rnuch smaller than the length of the signal, the signal singularities can be
characterized by then1. These singularities m.ay be used for the detection of abnormalities.

l<or exarnple, if one can find the special pattern for nonna1 sleep eye n1overnents shnila.r to
\vhat has been found for the nonnal waveform in the ECG, then the gates will open for sleep disorder therapies. Signaltnodelling is also used in signal prediction and signal interpolation. In both of these

20

21
probleins, a signal x:(n) is known over an interval of time and the goal is to predict :r(n) for the next san1ple. In the prediction probletu, as an exan1ple, :t:(n) is known over the duration of N san1ples and the goal is to predict the
~r: ( 1V

+ 1) value. In the interpolation problmn,

one or n1ore consecutive values Inay be distorted and the goal is to accurately predict these distorted san1ples. For exa1nple, in son1e sleep disorder patients the ECG signals distorted the EOG signals. In these cases, the need for a prediction 1nethod for recovering the signals is significant. One of the famous modelling Inethods is autoregressive (AR) n1odelling, whieh will be discussed in detail in this chapter. On the other hand, a wavelet transform can help transform the EOG signal fron1 the tilne-domain into tilne and frequency space. This transformation can help to extract 1nore inforn1ation about norrnalities and a.bnonnalities in EOG signals. \Vavelet analysis may be a good
nu~thod

for analyzing non-stationary signals such as EOG. \Vavelet analysis can

represent high and low frequency inforrr1ation with different spatial resolution in a eolnpu.tationally efficient way. Wavelet analysis, which was used first in seisn1ic geology, is developed in other fields such as physics, Inathernatics, and electrical engineering. Consequently, this rnethod has been developed for rnany applications in 1nedical and industrial fields such as FBI Fingerprint Con1pression [90], data denoising [91], and data mining [92]. In this research, AR rnodelling and wavelet analysis have been used for extraction and classification of sleep eye n1ove1nents of those who were exposed to antidepressant rnedication and those who were not. This chapter discusses the theories that support the n1ethods used in this research. This chapter is divided into the following six sections: the uncertainty principle, wavelet analysis, all-pole and autoregressive modelling, pattern classification, and receiver operating characteristic ROC curve.

The Uncertainty Principle and Heise11berg Rectangles

The uncertainty principle states that '"the energy spread of a function and its Fourier transfonn [see Appendix A] cannot be shnultaneously arbitrarily small [93]." In 1946, Gabor

22
defined elernentary tirne-frequeney aton1s. Tirne-frequency aton1s are the waveforrns with
Ininimal energy spreadin the thne-frequency plane. He proposed to deccnnpose signals over these a.ton1s to measure the tiine-frequency energy sprea.(L or in a silnple word, "infonnation" [93). Gabor atoins are constructed by a translated window gin the tirne and frequency dcnnainl

Equation 2.1 defines this window.

The time-frequency localization of an atorn, called the Heisenberg Box, is represented in Figure 2.1. The Heisenberg Box is a rectangle with thne width of O't and frequency height of O'w. Although the length and width of the Heisenberg Box rnay vary, the area. of the box

is derived from the uncertainty principle by the inequality of Equation 2.3. This area is
minirnurn if g is a Gaussian distribution. In this ease the atorns are called Gabor Fnnctions.

Wavelet Analysis

\Vavelets are powerful tools that can be used to analyze the thne-frequency behaviour of a signal with finite energy. Wavelets decompose the signal into the time and frequency dornains. The wavelet decon1position c<.u1 have the advantage of better performance in tilne varying signals, and/or on signals with singular characters, such as EOG and EEG, than other linear time-frequency transfonns such as Short Tin1e Fourier. This is due to decon1posing the signals into different scales. Wavelet analysis has been applied in n1any disciplines such as data compression, irnage analysis, and signal processing [94]. \Vavelet analysis reveals aspects such as trends, breakdown points, discontinuities in higher derivatives, and self-shnilarity, while other signal analysis techniques rnay not be able to do so. Furthermore, wavelet analysis is often used for de-noising a. signal without rnuch

24

degradation. \Vavelet transfonn is a linear transfonn. In other words, the wavelet transfonns the tirnefrequency inforrnation of a. signal, with a fa:mily of wavefonns, into the tilne and frequency do1nain without 1nissing any infonnation [94]. 'Thus, a signal or function f(t) can be analyzed,
only if it can be expressed as a linear decornposition in the fonn such as Equation 2A.

f(t) = ~at'l/Jz(t)
l

(2.4)

where l is an integer index for the finite or infinite surn, a1 is the set of real-valued expansion coefficients, a.nd 4Jt(t) is a set of real-valued functions of t, known as the expansion set. If the expansion of Equation 2.4 is unique, then the expansion set will be called the basis [95].

Signal Classes and Signal Space Analysis

There are three types of signals; L 2 ( ?R), L 1 OR), and D-istribtttions.

A space that is particularly irnporta.nt in signal processing is L 2 UR) . This is the space of all functions, f(t), with finite energy, i.e., it contains all functions w·ith finite square integrals:

f

[95].

£ 1 (~) is the next rnost basic class of signals. It contains all functions "vith finite absolute
value integrals:

L1

=}

J IJ(t)j 1dt = E < oo [95].

A 1nore general class of signals are Distributions. These signals, or functions, are not

defined by having "values.'' They are defined by the value of their inner product with a
norn1al function. An exa1nple of this farnily is the Dirac delta. function, 8(t;), which is defl.ned as: f(T)

= J .f(t)6(t- T)dt (95].

A function space is a linear vector space, with finite or infinite dirnensions, where the
vectors a.re functions, and the scalars are real nurnbers. The inner product of f(t) and g(t) is a scalar a, obtained from Equation 2.5 [95).

a

= (f (t), g ( t))

= ./ f* (t) g (t) dt

25
''rhere f*(t) is the conjugate ofj(t). The Norrn of the length of a vector is defined by Equation 2.7 [95].

11!11 = VICf,f)l
If the basis is an orthogonal, then:

(2.6)

If the inner product of two signals (vectors) is zero, those signals are called orthogonal,

k=fl

(2.7)

Coefficients of Equation 2.4 are derived fron1 Equation 2.8, by the inner product where: [95]

A sin1ple scaling and t·ranslation can generate a single scaling function or a wavelet (Equation 2.9) [95].

Scaling Function Analysis

A set of scaling functions is defined in a shnpler fonn such as Equation 2.10, in tenus of
translation of a basic scaling function

i.pk(t) = cp(t- k)
Suppose the subspace of 1}(~), which is called tion 2.11.

(2.11)

26
where integer k changes fro1n -oo to +oo; and the closure which is denoted by
over~bar

1neans f(t) = '£akf.Pk(t) for any f(t) E v0 [95). k The size of the subset can be spanned by changing the tirne scale of the scaling functions. Equation 2.12 represents such a change (95] .

[95).

In conclusion, by increasing j (if j > 0), the scales becorne finer since <.pj,k(i;) becomes
narrower; therefore, it is translated into s1naller steps. If j < 0, by increasing the absolute
value of j, r.pj,k(t) becornes wider and, only coarse infonnation can be represented by wider

scaling functions [95]. This concept was originally derived frorn 1nap analysis. In a coarse scale, the 1nap includes wider infonnation without presenting the details; however, a. rnap with the sarne size and a finer scale has narrower inforn1ation but presents n1ore details.

Multiresolution Analysis in Subspaces
For fonnulating the basic require1nent of nnlltiresolution analysis (~IRA), the following re-

lationship in Equation 2.14 should be considered, because of the intuitive ideas of scale.

(2.14)

where v -·-("-' = {0} and v+oo

= L2.

This equation dernonstrates that each coarse space is a

subset of a finer scale, which rneans the inforn1ation at finer scale also exists at the rnore
coarse seale. To satisfy the natural scaling condition, the following relation is expected:

(2.15)

Equation 2.15 shows that ele1uents in a space are simply scaled for the next space. Figure 2.2 represents the condition of Equation 2.15, which rneans if t.p( t) E v0 , then r.p( t) E v1 , and the space is spanned by <p(2t) . Therefore, rp(t) can be expressed in tern1s of cp(2t) in the form, of Equation 2.16. This equation is the basic equation ofmultiresolution formulation [95].

fenmt scales, and the resulting coefficients were used for classification of patients who were
exposed to antidepressant 1nedica.tions and those who were not.

The Wavelet Function and Wavelet Vector Spaces
-~,j,l.~(t),

The in1port.ant features of a signal can be described by defining a set of functions,

that span the difrerences between the spaces by various scales of the scaling functions. These functions, ·ljJ.i,k(t), are slightly different fron1 scaling functions \.Pj,k(t), and they are known as wavelets. The scaling functions are orthogonal to wavelets. The advantages of this orthogonality are in the shnplicity of the calculation of expansion coefficients. This rncans that all n1en1bers of
l/j

and

Wj

are orthogonal, which can be described characteristically in the mathernatical

fonn of Equation 2.17:

Any function, g(t) E L 2 (~), can be written in the forrn of Equation 2.20 as a series of
expansions in tenns of a scaling function (first term of the right side of the equation) and wavelets (seeond term of the right side of the equation) [95].

Continuous Wavelet Transforrn

By definition, the continuous wavelet transforn1 (CvVT), vVf(a, b), of a finite-energy signal .f(t) is the correlation of f(t) with a ruother wavelet.
It is not a weakness for a wavelet that it produces a tilne-scale and not a tin1e-frequency

vievv of a. signal A time-scale introduces a. different way of viewing data, which is a natural way of vie\ving data fro1n a large number of natural phenomena. For exarnple, the lunar landscape has a ragged surface due to bmnbardinent by different sizes of 1neteorites. If this surface is hnagined as a one-dhnensional signal, then it can be interpreted that the signal has the cornponents of different scales; large features are rnade by large 1neteorites and fine features by s1nall ones. In n1ost natural signal analyses such as n1odelling the natural structures of douds, 1nountain landscapes, c:oa.stlines, blood vessels, and tree branches, thinking in tern1s of seale tnakes n1ore sense than thinking in tenns of frequency, because the repetitive shapes are different in terrns of scales. Also, there is an inverse relationship between scale and frequency: ma.theinatically, scale is one over frequency. The C\VT is defined by Equation 2.23, and the Inverse Continuous \Vavelet Transform (ICvVT) is defined in Equation 2.24. In C\VT, f(t) is a continuous function over the variable
t.; thus, F(a, b) is a continuous function over the variables a and b.

consists of two digital filters, high pass and low pass, and two down samplers, by 2.

In other words, g[.] is the high pass filter in nature, and h[.] is the low pass filter in nature. Mter passing the signal through the high pass filter, the downsampled result by 2 is called "detail" . After passing the signal through low pass, the downsampled result by 2 is called "approximation" [97]. The approximation part will go through further decompositions, as

Log-Gabor Wavelet

In 1987, the solution to the Gabor wavelet (see Appendix B) was proposed by Field [98]. He discovered that natural ilnages are better when passed through Gaussjan filters and presented in logaxithinic frequency scales. Equation 2.29 shows the transfer function of the log-Gabor function [98].

G(w) = exp( -log(w/u.,0 ) 2 )/(2(log{k/w0 ) 2 )

(2.29)

where w0 is the centre frequency of the filter and k / U.'o should be a constant while w0 is varying. T'he log-Gabor wavelet has two characteristics. It has no DC value and it has
an exteiltled tail at high frequencies. Furthennore, the second eha.racteristic has been used

33 in filtering of the natural in1ages where their an1plitude spectra decrease at a.pproxbnately

1/w [98].

All-Pole a11d Autoregressive Modelling

All- pole 1nodels are popular for several reasons. The physical process by which a signal is
generated will result in an all-pole (autoregressive) signal in son1e applications. Furthermore,
in otli~ applications for which it rnay not be possible to fit an all-pole 1nodel for the signal, an

all-pole rnodel ean be found to approxilnate the process, because in 1nany different types of applications all-pole 1nodels have been found to provide a. sufficiently accurate representation. Also, all-pole rnodels are special structures that are found in all-poll equations, which n1ake algoritlnns fast and efficient for finding the all-pole pararneters [99]. Signal :.c(n) has a real or con1plex value, and it is equal to zero for n < 0. Equation 2.30 represents the forn1 of all-pole modelling of :r('n).

(2.30)
rrhe coefficients of all-pole rnodel a 11 (k), can be derived by different. 1nethods. For ex-

<:u:nple, with Prony 's 1nethod, the coefficients can be found by 1ninhuizing the error given in
Equation 2.31 [99].

Therefore, norrnal equations which are used for evaluating the all-pole n1odel coefficients by Prony's nwthod are derived frorn Equation 2.33 and 2.34 [99).

Also, Equation 2.35 represents the initial value for solving the Norrnal equations, and is derived by satisfying the energy constraint [99]:

By the above assurnption, Equation 2.35, the n1inin1un1 error is evaluated by Equation 2.36 [99].

(2.36)

If a white noise v(n) is filtered with a eausa.llinear shift-invariant filt,er havh1g a rational
systen1 function with an all-pole filter of the fonn of Equation 2.30, the filter is called a.n autoregressive (AR) process of order p, and it. is referred to as a.n AR(p) process. In other words, AR.(p) is a wide-sense stationary process which xnay be generated by filtering tinit

variance white noise, v(n), with an all-pole filter of the form of Equation 2.80 [99). One can accept that the autocorrelation sequence of an AR process satisfies the YulevValker equations of the fonn:

(2.:37)

Therefore, if autocorrelation values

Ta.~(k)

are given fork

1, 2, ... , ]J, then the AR coef-

ficients can be derived. 'rhis rnethod is known as the Yule-\Valker n1ethod. By con1paring
Yule- \Valker equations and nonnal equations of Prony's Inethod for all-pole 111odelling, one

can understand that the two sets of equations a.re identicaL The only diffe{ence between thern is how the autocorrelation 1'a:(k) is defined in each E-.I({Uation; 'ta,(k) is a detenuinistic

35 autocorrelation in all-pole n1odelling of Prony's 1nethod, and it is a statistical autocorrelation

in the Yule-\Valker n1ethod. Also b(O) is evaluated by:

lb(O) I2 = Ta:(O) +

(2.38)

Furthennore, the statistical autocorrelation can be esti1nated fron1 a sample realization of

the process. For exarnple, if ~c(:n) is detennined for 0 ::; n < JV, then f x(O) can be esthnat.ed

by using

(2.39)

Therefore, despite the differences beb.veen stochastic and detenninistic all-pole n1odelling,
the two methods are almost equivalent when the two autocorrelations are estirnated.

In several approaches 1 to estirnate the optilna1 all-pole model coefficients ap(k) , an error is
defined, and an atte.rnpt is
tnach~

to rninilnize it. One of the methods for parmneterizing

the all-pole filter is to use lattice filter. In this n1ethod the reflection coefficient is used to
tninhnize the errors. One of
thesf~

lattice filter approaches is Burg's method.

The Burg algorithn1 has been used in this work to esthnate AR coefficients. In the 1960s,
he developed a Inethod, called the
m.a~r;in-w.rn

entropy rnethod, for spectrurn esthna.tion. A

part of this n1ethod involves finding an all-pole n1odel for the data. He also dernonstrated how reflection coefficients can be con1put.ed sequentially, by n1inhnizing the sun1 of the forward
and back\vard predication errors [99].

Pattern Classification
rE-\(~ognition

In this section, the theories supporting the classification procedures in this research are discussed. Rangayya.n defines pattern or classification as: "categorizing of input

da.ta into identifiable dasses via the extraction of significant features or attributes of the data frorn a background of irrelevant detail" [100]. In bio1nedical signal analysis, one can extract quantitative features frorn the signaL Each real signalrnay consist of infinite features. For evaluating the best classifier, the choosing of features is also important. Nevertheless, each signal can be represented by a feature vector x n1easured
vector~

= (:1; 1 , x 2, ... , Xn)r, which is also called the

or the pattern vector in which ~ri represents the measuren1ent of a feature as

a real value. Therefore, the end of vector x represents a point in ann-dilnensional Euclidean
spacE-~

[100]. Figure 2.6 represents the vectors of shnilar objects that are fornwd as clusters.

Appropriate design of preprocessing and the feature extraction procedure are the keys to having good classification results. In the pattern classification problen1s, one is eager to find the opt.ilnal decision boundaries to separate the data into pattern elasses based on the feature vectors [100]. In the literature of dassifica.tion, tra·ining set refers to a given set of feature vectors of known categorization with which the da.ssifier is desjgned. Also, testing set: refers to new feature vectors of known classes, which test the perforn1ance of the classifier. The approach of using a trah1ing set and then a testing set is kno\\'n as supervised pattern classification; the training set is used to develop the rnathen1a.tical function that can characterize the separation between the classes, and the ·testing set is used for testing the classification performance by using the provided n1athe1natical function [1 00].

Linear Discrhninant Analysis

Linear Discrhninant Analysis (LDA) was introduced by Fisher in 1936. Fisher used the LDA analysis for taxonornic analysis in [101.]. In 1968, Altn1an introduced LDA in the failure prediction literature. LDA has been used in 1ua.ny applications, especially in two-case clas-

sifications for faHure prediction in n1a.nufacturing, and for 1nanagen1ent or norrnal/ abnormal classification in medical applications such as cancer detection or heart disease.
In this research, LDA has been applied in two-group cases, known as binary cases. In a
binary case, LDA is based on the linear discrilninant function of the independent variables,

(x 1 , :r2 , ;c 3 , ... , J~ 11 ), in Equation 2.46. Figure 2.7 represents Equation 2.46.

(2.46)
where d(x) is the score of the function,
Wn+l

is a. constant, known as bias or threshold ·weight,

and (w 1 , w 2 , w 3 , ... , wn) are discrirninant coefficients called weight vecto·rs. To rnaxiinize the

distance between the group 1nea.ns of d(x) , the pararneters of the function are traditionally estin1ated with the ordinary least-squares n1ethod [102] [103]. Also, d(x) is called a linear discrin1ina.nt or decision function, where the following equation exists: x

=

(~1;1, :!;2 , ... , ~rn, 1 )T, also known as the feature vector, augrnented by an additional

entry equal to unity.

The equation of w

= (w1 , w2 , ··. , Wn, Wn+l)T is also known as the

aug1nented weight vector [100].

A two-dass pattern classification can be described by Equation 2.4 7.

(2.47)

where C\ and C!2 are the two classes. Here, d(x) is the discrhuinant function separating the two classes, as represented in Figure 2.6 [100).
\

In the two-case 1nethod (i.e t\l\t'o-class n1ethod), each of the two classes is separable fron1 the other by a single decision surface. In other words, if d.i(x) > 0, then x E Ci and 'i

Patterns which are separable by linear decision functions are said to be linearly separable.

40
It should also be added that in other cases, such as in an inflnite va.riety of cornplex decision boundaries, it will be described by generalized nonlinear decision functions of the feature vectors, as has been shown in Equation 2.48:

d(x) = Wtfl (x) + w2f2(x) + ...
{fi(x)} where (i In son1e cases

Ji (x)

feature vector is transforrned to: xt

= (f1 (x), .f2 (x), ... , fk(x), l)r, and d(x) isflefined linearly
\

Hyperplane as the Decision Surface

In general, the vector of :r has usua.lly 1nore than two dinwnsions, so when d(x) is linear,
the decision surface that separates points assigned to each class, is a HypeTplan,e, fl. In this case, if x 1 and x 2 are both on the decision surface, then Equation 2.49 and 2.50 will be true.

(2.49)

(2.50)

This rneans that w is nonna.l to any vector lying in the hyperplane; in other words, it is perpendicular to the hyperplane. It can be a.ssu1ned that hyperplane Jl divides the feature space into two parts: decision region R 1 for the class (\, and R2 for the class
(}2

[10:3].

The norrnal vector w points toward R1 , because d( x) > 0, if x is in R 1 . By convention, if x is in ll 1 , it is said to be on the positive side of 11, and if it is in R 2 , it is said to be on the negative side of J-1 [103). w

X= Xp

(2.51)

In Equation 2.52, d(x) rneasures the distance of x froin the hyperplane [103]. In this equation;
Xp

is a nonnal projection of feature vector x onto hyperplane !1, and

is the

41
distance between x and x 11 · (See Figure 2.8). Therefore,
't

is positive if x is on the positive

side of JJ.', and negative if it is on the negative side of If. Since d(~rp) = Oj fro1n discriminant function of d(x)

= wT x + w0 ,

Equation 2.52 (whieh is equivalent to 2.53) is derived.

d(x) = w 1' x

rrherefore, the distance fron1 the origin to the hyperplane of fi is derived by ·;. , in 11 11 which the origin is on the positive side of H if ·w0 > 0, and the origin is on the negative side if
lL.Io

d(x)

if w 0 = 0. In this case, d(x) is said to have homogeneous fonn. Figure 2.8

represents this algebraic result [103].

In other words, a linear discrhninant function divides the feature space into separate regions by a hyperplane decision surface. The nonnal vector w determines the origin

the surface. Also, the bias

'Wo

42 detennines the location of the surface, Therefore, d(x) is

proportional to the signed distance fron1 x to ·the hyperplane. If x is on the positive side, then d(x) > 0 and if x is on the negative side, then d(x) < 0 [10:3].

Distance Function
As considered in Figure 2.6, the prototypes z 1 and z 2 are typically computed as the average feature vectors for each of the two classes. Equation 2.54 shows between an arbitrary pattern vector x and the

Leave-One-Out Method
When a lhnited nu1nber of smnple vectors with known classifications are used, it is in1portant to know how znany sarnples n1ay be used for training a classifier. One should consider

that once the classifier has been design<::d, another independent set of sa1nples of known classification n1ust be used for testing the classification. In the case that there exist a large nun1ber of sa.1nples for classification, the set n1ay be randomly split into two approxhnately equal parts. One is used for training and the other is used for testing. The randon1-splitting can occur several tirnes in order to generate several classifiers, and one of these classifiers can be chosen as the best classifier on the basis of its perfonnance [100}. The leave-one-out 1nethod is a suitable method for estilnating the classification accuracy of a pattern classification, especially when the nurnber of available san1ples is smalL In this n1ethod, one of the sainples is excluded as the testing set, and the re1naining sa.tuples are used

N sarnples cla.ssHication, \vith this Inethod, JV -1 sf:nnples are used as trainers to design the

classifier, and one sarnple is used for

tf~sting

the classification each time; and this procedure

is repeated .N tirnes. Finally, an averag(3 classification accuracy is evaluated using all the test results [100].

In a sirnple case consideration, it is assurned that the sainple set covariances of the two
dasses are equal. For exan1ple, there are two san1ple sets: 8 1 = {::c~:l), ... ,a:~;} fron1 the class of

the two cases are equaL For the shnplification of this example, the Bayes classifier and the
assurnption that :r has a n1ultivariate Gaussian PDF distribution have been used. Therefore,
:r: is assigned to class (71 if it satisfies Equation 2.59:

Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve

Any assessrnent of diagnostic perfonnance seen1s to require son1e ccnnparison of diagnostic

decisions with the "truth." The shnplest n1easure of diagnostic decision quality is the fraction of eases for which the physidan is correct, often is called accuracy. Sensitivity and specificity represent two kinds of accuracy, the first for actually positive cases a.nd the second for

45 actually negative cases, frmn. which accuracy is derived. Equations 2.65, 2.66, and 2.67

1nathernatically represent them.

P(LJ+) is the prior probability of the actual presence of the disease in a. case frorn the
population studied, and P(D-) = 1- P(I)+) represents the prior probability that disease is actually absent in a case fron1 the studied population [104].

It should be considered that sensitivity is also called

rJ~rue

Positive Fraction (TPF), and

specificity is also called True Negative Fraction (TNF). !Vledically, true positive n1eans that
the test indicates the presence of disease, when it is in fact present. False negative 1neans that the test indicates the presence of disease, when it is, in fact, not the case. Accordingly, two new tern1s can be suggested by False Positive Fraction (FPF) and False Negative Fraction (FNF), described in Equations 2.68, 2.69.

Figure 2.9 represents the overlap of the distribution of result values in actually positive and actually negative result values. It is considered that one cannot find a single threshold to separate the population clearly. As one can see, TPF, FPF, FNF, a.nd TNF change by changing the threshold ,ralue. Therefore, a threshold value should be chosen in such a way to compensate for the gains and losses, and to rnake a. balance between the decision fractions [104).

The confidence threshold depends on ·factors such as the estirnate of prior probability and the assessrnent of the consequences of correct and incorrect decisions. Furtherrnore, in 1nost cases this threshold is not fL"'Ced, and it varies, which causes the variation in decision fra.ctions [104}. Although change in the decision threshold is caused by the variation of decision of all four factors, only TPF and FPF can be used to detern1ine all of four of the decision factors (Table 2.1 ). Therefore, these t\vo fractions can be tracked to evaluate a rnethod by changing the decision threshold [104]. By referring to Figure 2.9, one can see tha.t raising the decision threshold rnust increase both FPF and TPF. Therefore, FPF and TPF increase or decrease siinultaneously as the decision threshold is changed, no n1atter what the fonns of the two distributions are [104]. The TPF and FPF values can be plotted as "y" and "x" l coordinate values, while changing the decision threshold such as in Figure 2.10. The axis of this graph stretches frorn zero to one, because they are the lirnits of possible FPF and TPF (probabilities). It is considered that all points of this graph represent all possible combinations of TPF and FPF. This curve is called the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Since it describes the inherent detection characteristics of the test, and since the receiver of the test infonnation can operate at any point on the curve corresponding to the appropriate decision threshold! the receiver operating characteristic ROC curve is known for evaluating a diagnostic test [104]. Three possible operating points are shown in Figure 2.10: a strict threshold represents a case called positive only if judged ahnost definitely positive; a n10derate threshold; and a lax threshold. La.. x represents a. case called positive in any suspicion of disea.'3e [104]. To understand what the curve 1neans, it is considered that if disease prevalence is low, FPF rnust be kept stnall by choosing an appropriate threshold value; otherwise, all positive decisions will be considered false positive decisions, which may cause 1nany unnecessary exarninations or treat1nents of the patients. Also, FPF should be kept srnall for cases in which the consequences of a false positive decision are very dangerous, perhaps due to a high-risk, unnecessary surgery. In both eases, the decision 1naker should operate on the

test with the san1e receiver operating characteristic: (ROC) curve is applied to a population with high disease prevalence, the decision threshold should be chosen higher on the curve for accepting higher FPF in order to keep FNF low and TPF high [104] . Figure 2.11 represents the con1parison between test A and test B. Test lA is superior to
test B, because for the sa1ne FPF, test A has a higher TPF than test B, a.nd for the sarne

TPF, test A has a lo\iver FPF than test B. Actually, the test perfonna.nce is ehecked by the
area under the receiver operating chan:leteristic (ROC) curve. The greater the area under

the curve, the better the perfonnance of the test [104].

ative decisions [105]. Also, .one should know that in the detection

an illness in patients,

it is often better to optilnize the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)

curve, rather than rninirnizing the error of classification [106). Therefore, the area. under the curve can be considered as one of the n1ost hnporta.nt criteria in the evaluation of a 1nethod.

Chapter 3 Sleep Eye Movement Detection. and Autoregressive Modelling

E

LECTROOCULOGRAM (EOG) signals recorded during sleep have been considered by researchers for analysis recently. This research attempts to show that eye move-

ments change significantly in patients exposed to antidepressant medications. This chapter describes the proposed methods of this research that how eye movements are detected, autoregressive (AR) coefficients of eye movements are derived, and the LDA classifications are used to represent the difference in the sleep eye movements of depressed patients who used antidepressant medications, and those who did not. Figure 3.1 represents the block diagram of the methodology used in this chapter. Each part of this block diagram is discussed in detail.

Figure 3.1: Methodology Used for the Sleep Eye Movement posed/Unexposed to Antidepressant Medication

Cl~ificati~

of Patients Ex-

In this chapter, two groups of five patients who were exposed to Prozac (one group called 'A', the other called 'P'), one group of five patients who were exposed to Celexa (called 'L'), one group of five patients who were exposed to Effexor (called 'E'), and two groups

52

53 of five patients who were not exposed to antidepressant 1nedication (one group called 'N', the other called 'C,) were considered. Due to confidentiality of the patient infonnation, the other infonnation such as na1ne, gender, and age of the patients were not released through the sleep lab by the tin1e of this research.

Eye Movement Detection

Sleep eye rnovmnents are analyzed by expert clinicians. The long period of sleep recording, which is about six to eight hours, 1nakes the precise analysis of eye n10ven1ents iinpossible even for qualified experts. In order to analyze the sleep eye movmnents, eye n1ovmnent detection softwa,re is required for quantification. On the other hand, a con1puter-assisted method is able to extract more infonnation out of recorded data, and provides the tin1e locations of detected 1noven1ents for further a.ssessn1ents. In order to develop a Inethodology, 1nanual eye n1overnent detection by clinicians should be considered. Figures 3.2 and 3.3 represent the eye rnove1nents' signals when the subject looks toward four different directions; leftward, rightward, upward, and downward. The

sa.nrpling rate in these figures is 128 sa.1nples per second, and the y-axes are voltages with
the unit of volt. Although the ROC signals in upward and do\v11ward n1ovmnent are not recorded well in the up and do\'V'Il exa.n1ples (see Figures 3.3), the four different types of the eye rnovements (leftward, rightward, upward, and downward) follow the decision rules of Table 3.1. On the basis of the eye n1oven1ent decision table, if LOC-A2 (called loc, in lowercase) has a positive peak value, represented by (+), and ROC- Al (called roc) has a negative peak, represented by (-),and VOC-Al (voc) has a negative peak, also represented
by ( -), then the rnovernent is classified as rightward movenwnt.. The other cases can be

derived frorn 'I'able 3.1. The eye movement detection procedure block diagran1 is plotted in Figure 3.4. The following sections describe each block of this procedure in detail.

Figure 3.4: The Block Diagram of Eye Movement Detection Procedure

3.1.1

Eye Movement Detection, Algorithm 1

The block diagram of Figure 3.4 represents Algorithm 1, which is used for eye movement detection. This algorithm includes sleep stage segmentation, bandpass filter, time segmentation, DC and above 3 standard deviation (SD) elimination, normalization, threshold and windowing, and Boolean classification. The inputs of Algorithm 1 are EOG signals including loc, roc, and voc. The outputs of this algorithm are detected movements in sleep EOG signals. In the following section, the specifications of this algorithm are discussed.

Sleep Stage Segmentation
In the first stage of the detection procedure, the EOG signals of each subject are divided into six sleep stages (wakefulness, Stages 1 - 4, and REM sleep) by following the clinical procedures in eye movement detections. provided hypnograms. The provided EOG signals, from the sleep laboratory at the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Sleep stage segmentation is done by means of

56 Centre, include the six to eight hours of EOG signals (LOC, ROC, and VOC), two mastoid
signals, and a hypnogram (see Figure 3.5). Also for more information about EOG signals, one can refer to Section 1.1.3. Sleep stage information over time for each subject, called a hypnogram, was provided with full polysomnographic information by clinicians [2]. Figure 3.5 represents about 7.5 hours of ROC and LOC data with a hypnogram. In the hypnogram part of Figure 3.5, wakefulness is represented by zero, Stage REM by 5, Stage 1 by 1, Stage 2 by 2, and so forth. Although Figure 3.5 was provided for the time analysis of EOG signals in the-first stage of this study, it was used thereafter for EOG segmentation. \

Lowpass Filter
The EOG signal is recorded with the san1pling rate of 128 sarnples per second. The range of frequency of the EOG signals which are processed in this research extends frorn zero to 64Hz. This is because of the fact that these signals have been recorded at a san1pling rate of 128 sarnples per second, which is twice the rnaxirnum frequency, 6411 z, pursuant to the Nyquist sarnpling theormn [107}. However, by the frequency analysis, which wa.l3 done in Chapter 4, one can see that rnost of the frequency con1ponents ru:e below 20Hz. For sin1plicity in Algorithn1 1, the Iowpass Finite hnpuJse Response (FIR) filter was used. Also, the range of
the filter was designed for the cutoff frequency 20/-J z in order not to lose n1uch infonnation.

Different orders of the FIR filter vvere used, but the final filter with an order of 200 was chosen. Although the order of this filter rnay be high for hardware huplernentation, the purpose is to use a rnore ideal filt.er for cleaning the signal rather than a practical hardware filter.

Time Seg1nentation
Expert sleep clinicians analyze the eight-hour sleep signals in 30-second epochs. The full polysornnographic infonnation, including EOG, EivfG, EEG, and other channels are analyzed by clinicians in order to rnonitor the details of sleep onset of a patient. It should be rnentioned that other durations, such. as five-second and ten-second epochs can also be used. Furthennore, the :30-second epochs are n1ore cmnn1on and are used in Algorithm 1 for sleep eye rnovmnent detection.

DC and Above Three Standard Deviation Elhnination
T he technique that clinicians use to detect eye movernent is based on the detection of an1

tiphase wavefonns in EOG eharn1els 1 regardless of DC fluctuations. Therefore, the mean value of each 30-second epoch was evaluated. Thereafter, the difference between the signal and 1nean value in the epoch was used as the DC-elirninated signaL In addition, the values above three SD are rernoved by evaluating the SD within the epoch and setting the values

58

above three SD to zero.

N orn1alization
The 30-second epoch DC-elin1inated and above-:3-SD-eliminated signal is used· for nonnalization. E1'1DS detects the rna.xinuun value for each processed signal Then, all the values of the epoch were divided by the n1axirnun1 value. Thus, the signal was norn1alized for con1parison. This rnethod is used by clinicians for sleep eye 1novenwnt detection. The nonnaliza.tion is used by dinicia.ns to place noise below the threshold value, so that it will not be interpreted as a rnoven1ent. It should be considered that a great nun1ber of antiphase wavefonns exist in the noise level in the actual EOG signals , which are not eye rnovernents; or they may be m.ove1nents but not distinguished as eye move1nents.

Thresholding and Windowing
A certain threshold was used for eye n1ovem.ent detection. The values above this threshold
in EOG signals are a.ssun1ed eye n10vements. The threshold value was evaluated by the experilnent. Furtherrnore, the software should detect a 1nove1nent if there is a combination

of peak values above the threshold in different EOCi channels, according to Table 3.1. The
tirne indices of these rnaxhns and n1inirns are not equal. If the software decides only on the rnaximu1n and Ininiinunl, which has the sa.rr1e tirne index, then that n1ay cause the loss of eye 1noven1ent detection. The peak values of LOC , ROC, and VOC are con1pared in a defined window. There is no golden standard for the threshold and window size values. Furtherrnore, if the threshold value is high, a large nun1ber of Inovem.ents are rnissed in the detection procedure; and if the threshold is low, an antiphase noise \vill be detected as an eye 1noven1ent. On the other hand , if the window size is too sn1a.H, it causes the loss of eye rnovernent detection; and if the window size is too big, it causes an increase in the nuntber of detections, due to existing rna.xirnun1 and rninhnurns within one particular window. The threshold value of 0.2 and a window size of 15 sa.n1ples, experiluentally, were chosen. Tla.ble 3.2 represents the number of detected eye n1oven1ents with different thresholds and

59 window sizes. The detection prograrn in this particular evaluation runs over a segn1ent of

2000 san1ples. The threshold of 0.1 detects noises as eye n1ovexnents. Furthennore, the window size of 15 san1ples semns to be n1ore reasonable in the detection process.

Boolean Classification
Table 3.1 was used by clinicians to detect the eye Inoven1ents. On the basis of the eye rnovement decision table, if loc (LOC-A2) has a negative peak value, represented by ( -), roc has a positive peak? represented by(+), and voc has a positive peak, represented by(+), then the eye rnoveinent is classified as leftward 1noven1ent. The other types of 1novmnents can be detected by the peak status rnentioned in T'able :3.1.

Eye Moven1ent Detection, Algorithm 2

Due to the high cmnplexity of Algorithrn 1, the processing of 6 to 8 hours of EOG signals took a long thne, usually over an hour. Therefore, the n1oditleation of Algorithrn 1 to Algorithrn 2, for reducing the cmnplexity, was necessary. In this section, the changes in Algorithm 1 that led to the develop1uent of Algoritlun are discussed.

Using Vectors
Algorithn1 1 produced objects frorn the segments of each EOG signal, that were higher than the threshold value. These objects were con1pared according to Table 3.1 for eye rnoveinent detection. The process of making objects for all parts of the signal above the threshold had

60

increased the eon1plexity of Algoritlun 1. Also, if there was no rnatch between the objects, according to Table 3.1, the ElVIDS software would be crashed and locked in infinite loop. Furthennore, n1aking vectors, instead of objects fro1n the parts of each EOG signal, decreases the cornplexity. Therefore, vectors were used instead of objects in Algoritlun 2. "'\tVith this change, the cornplexity of the program. was reduced and the detection procedure beca1ne faster.

Band Pass Filter
The other xnodification for tnaking Algoritlnn 2
\Vas

using the band pass filter instead of

t.he low pass filter in Algorithn1 1. The 2007 AASJVl Man,ual of the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events reports of the use of a bandpass filter of 0.3- 35Hz. However, the data, which were used in this research, were recorded with a bandpass tllter of 0.;3- 64.H z. As will be discussed in Chapter 4, the nw.in frequency cornponents of EOG are in the range of 0.3 - 20/-/ z. The FIR filter vvith a low cutoff frequency 0.3H z and a high cutoff frequeney

20llz, with an order of 200, was provided for filtering the signaL

Verification Plots
Although some of the detected 1noven1ents were plotted for verification in Algorithn1 1, Algorithm 2 has the verification plots of all deteetcd rnovements. This feature can be used

by clinicians for the verification of eye n1ovement.

classes of thne duration for sleep eye n1oven1ents, clinically, the eye n1oven1ents are categorized into two rnain categories: slow eye n1ovenwnts, and fast eye 1noven1ents. Algorithn1 2 is able to derive the duration of an eye n1ovmnent. The duration of an eye rnovernent was derived for the detected eye n1ovmnent. A detected eye 1novernent, which is a signal passed through the filter, with its n1ean and the values above 3 SD removed, is known
fts

a post-processed signal. Therefore, the zero crossing can be used to derive the duration

of the detected n1ovement. The AAS:NI 1nanual explains that the eye movernents below
500tns in duration are considered fast n1oven1ents; and above this thne are considered slow

movements [2]. Table 3.3 represents the duration exan1ples of the detected eye rnovmnents.

Returning Other Eye l\tlove:tnent Specifications
This software also returns the other specifications of detected eye move1nents such as a thne index, and 1nax:ilnum atnplitude of the detected n1ovements for each EOG channeL

3. 2

Atttoregressive (AR) Modelling

After the detection of eye n1oven1ents, the Burg 1nethod was applied to derive the AR eoefficient,s of each m.oven1ent type (leftward, rightward, upward, and downward). After

detecting the n1ove1nents, the AR coefficients were derived using the Burg 1uethod. AR
coefficients represent the waveforrns of the signals. Therefore, AR coefficients can be used as features for the classification of the sleep eye n1oven1ent signals for those patients who were exposed to rnedication and t,hose who were not. The AR coefficients of all ten subjects (five patients who were exposed to Prozac tnedkation and five patients who were not) were grouped on the basis of the sleep stages and the type of rnove1nents. This section addresses

64

how the AR 1nodelling can be used for EOG analysis and how the optinnun .AR Inodel order was derived for this purpose.

EOG Segmentation
It should be considered that EOG signals are non-stationary signals: because their statistical

characteristics change over thne. On the other hand, AR coefficients can · be used for stationary signals. To solve the non-stationary problern of EOGs, in order to use the1n in AR 1nodell.ing, the fixed segrnenta.tion, which is the srnall window of fixed duration, was used. This is the simplest method to break an EOG signal into quasi-stationary segrnents. The non-stationarity of sleep EOGs is discussed in Section 4.1.1 in rnore detail. The tiine duration of sleep eye 1novements lasts fron1 30 san1ples, with a sarnpling rate of 128 sarnples per seeond, and to rnore than 700 sarnples in a few cases. The thne duration evaluation:. which was achieved by inspection, was done over the randornly chosen patients frorn each group ('A' who ·were exposed to Prozac, 'Ej who were exposed to Etiexor, 'L' who \Vere exposed to Celexa, 'C' (Controls) who were not exposed to any antidepressant medication). Randon1 epochs frorn all the stages of each patient were considered for the evaluation of sleep eye n1ovement durations. Accordingly, a duration of 300 sarnples was chosen for segn1enting the signal because rnost of the eye 1noven1ents are in the range of

250-500 sarnples. Figure 3.10 represents exarnples of the sleep eye nwven1ent tirne durations
frorn patient A1 in Stage 3. Figure 3.11 shows another san1ple of the san1e patient in Stage RElVL Figure 3.12 shows the exarnples of the sleep eye movernent tin1e duration frorn patient C3 (fron1 patients who were not exposed to any antidepressant medication, known as the Control group) in wakefulness. It should be considered that the segment induding an eye movernent is between the two n1arked datapoints. In order to derive the AR nwdel of

the EOG signals, the EOGs were segmented into 301 sarnples; 150 san1ples before and 150 samples after the detected rnovenwnts as well as the detected sanrple, in order to be stationary or quasi-stationary.

Model Order Optimization

68

Two n1ethods were used for evaluating the AR rnodel order. One rnethod of evaluating rnodel order is to use the error plots and the other is to use the Akaike Infor. m ation Criterion (AIC) 1nethod [HJ8]. Both of then1 are discussed in this part.

Error Plots
The AR rrwdel order of detected eye rnovernents was derived by inspection through rninin1u1u rnean-square values of the prediction error. The opti1nal AR n1odel was detennined to be
27.

Bonnet rnodelled the EOG signal as an autoregressive of order 2 and esthnated the

parmneters w.i th a Kahnan filter [109]; however, this model order rnay not be accurate for
EOG analysis. Although the low rnodel order 1nay reduce the co1nplexity of the procedure,

it increases the error. 1'he inspection over the rninirrnnn rnean-squa.re values was derived from the 175 plots. Figures 3.13 and 3.14 represent the 1nean-square error derived fron1 AR
rnodelling. In these plots, the n1ean square error was derived for different rnodel orders, 1 to 50. The value of 27 was evaluated by averaging over the different chosen rnodel orders.

AIC Criteria
The Akaike Infonnat.ion Criterion (AIC) [14] is a cornrnon method used for selecting an appropriate AR rnodel order based on the input process. This rnethod, which wa..'3 discussed
in Chapter 2 in detail, was used for evaluating the optin1un1 AR n1odel order. It is assurned

that input process has Gaussian statistics. The AIC fonnula for an AR process is represented
in Equation 3.1. . .., AIC = ln(.s) 2p N

+

(3.1)

where

E

is the 1nodelling error, 1J is the AR model order, and N is the nurnber of data

sarnples. The second tenn in Equation 3.1 is the pena.lty for use of extra AR coefficients. In other words, although increasing the n10del
ord~r

leads to having a higher accuracy value

in rnodelling the signal, it increases the co1nplexity, which could be an hnportant factor in

Figure 3.15 represents the AIC values versus AR model orders (1 to 100). Figure 3.15 specifies the AI C curves for ROC and LOC signals of leftward and rightward detected movements. In order to plot these curves, the AIC values were derived for model order 2 to 100 in steps of 2 (p

Classification Results

73

The goal of this research is to present the differences in the waveforn1 of the sleep eye Inoven1ent signals in response to antidepressant 1nedication, "\Vhich is not evident to clinicians in routine sleep
studi~_.s.

Iv1easures of sleep physiology not obvious to the lnunan eye Inay

provide ilnportant clues to disease states and response to therapy. After deriving the AR coefficients of the eye rnovernents recoded during sleep, Linear Discrhninant Analys.is (LDA) was used to represent the difference between the eye n1oven1ent wavefonns of the signal of the patients who were exposed to antidepressant 1nedications and those who were not. In this section, LDA was used for two rnajor con1parisons. One eo:mparison was done between the
sk'f~P

eye 1novernents of a group of five depressed patients, taking Prozac, with the

generic na.rne of Fluoxetine, and a group of five depressed patients ta,king no antidepressant Inedication. Another co1nparison was 1nade between two other groups of five pat.ient.s who were exposed to antidepressant 1nedications, Celexa, with the generic narne of Citaloprmn, and Effexor, with the generic na1ne of Venlafaxine, with five patients who to antidepressant rnedications (Controls).

AR Classification of Patients Exposed/Unexposed to Prozac

This section describes a classification of All coefficients derived frorn a group of five patients who used Prozac rnedication, and a group of five patients who did not. AR coeffldfmts of eye 1noven1ents recorded during sleep were derived and classified by 1neans of discrhninant analysis. The 1nethodology used for this classification included eye rnovement detection and the evaJuation of AH. coefficients \Vith the fixed segtnents. The opthnized n1odel order of 27 was derived by n1inin1un1 square error inspection. AR coefficients were then derived on the ba.-;;is of this optin1un1 value. The results were classified with a linear discrhninant function. The overall average accuracy was 82.8o/(j. An accuracy result of a classification the portion of the correct a.ssigned nu1nber of

cases. A.lso, this accuracy rElpresents the differences bet\:veen the waveforrns of the sleep eye

74 patients who \Vere exposed to Prozae n1edication and those who were not.

In other words, after evaluating the AR coefficients, the AR coefficients of all ten patients,

five patients who were not. exposed to antidepressant 1nedication (.lVl to iV5), and five
pa.tients w·ho were exposed to Prozae medication (Al to A5), \Vere grouped on the basis of the sleep stages and the type of n1ovem.ents.

LDA was applied to classify AR coefficients into nonnal and abnonnal. This research is
only focused on the results of left and right movexnent dassifica.tion for all the sleep stages.

AR Classification of Patients Exposed/Unexposed to Celexa and Effexor

This section describes the method used to demonstrate that the eye movements were different in patients who used antidepressant medications, compared to those who did not. Groups 1 and 2 included five patients who used Celexa and Effexor, respectively, compared to five patients not taking any antidepressant. This method included eye movement detection with eye movement detection software, and evaluation of AR coefficients with fixed segments. The AIC method was used for determination of an appropriate model order of 27. AR coefficients were derived on the basis of this optimum value and were then classified with a linear discriminant function. These coefficients represent the waveform of the sleep eye movements of all three groups. Figure 3.22 represents the distribution of three AR coefficients (out of 27 AR coefficients) that were used for linear discriminant classification. The overall average of the regular method accuracies were 76.4% , and 78.7% for Groups 1 and 2 respectively. The overall average of the leave-one-out method accuracies were 75.5% and 77.5% for Groups 1 and 2.

Figure 3.22: Distribution of three AR coefficients

Figures 3.23, 3.24, 3.25, and 3.26 are the leave-one-out method accuracy results of Groups 1 and 2 classifications. Figures 3.23, and 3.24 show the accuracy results of the classification of the AR coefficients of leftward and rightward eye movements for Group 1. In these cases, the patients did not experience Stage 4 sleep. The lower accuracy in Stage wakefulness and REM may be due to the fact that there are more fast movements in Stage wakefulness and REM which may be more easily corrupted by artifacts. Figures 3.25 and 3.26 show the leave-one-out accuracies for Group 2. It was possible to obtain these better results for Stage 3 and Stage 4 because of better detection of eye movements in these stages. The overall average of the regular method accuracies were

in the range of 72% to 80%. The overall average of the leave-one-out accuracies were in the range of 71 % to 80%. Tables 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11 show the accuracy results of Figures 3.23, 3.24, 3.25, and 3.26 in detail.

Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve, Method I

One of the criteria that can be used in evaluating a n1ethod is Receiver Operating ChaJ:a.cteristic (ROC). The theory of the Receiver{)perating Characteristics (ROC) curve was described in Chapter 2. Here, a rnethod whieh was used for evaluating the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of the AR rnodelling is described.
Suppose there are two matrices of AR coefficients .N and A. Both rna.trices co1nprise AR

coefficients derivcxl frcnn fixed segments (~~01 smnples), including detected rnovements (150
san1plcs before and 150 san1ples after a. detected Inoveinent). 1\tlatrix iV was derived frorn non:nal patients and lVIatrix /l frorn abnonnal patients. Each row of both rna.trices consists

of 27 AR coefficients derived frmn a detected n1overnent. At the first step, A and IV are norrnalized over each row of the rnatrix. Thereafter,
the 1ninilnurn and rnaxin1un1 of rna.trix jV and A were evaluated for eolunu1s of nonnalized

1natrices. Therefore, each cohnnn of A or JV has a minirnun1, a rnaxirnurn, and a range (the distance between the n1inilnurn and the rnaxirnurn). There are six possibilities in cornparisons between the range of each colunu1 of A and 1\! :
1. The range of A is within the range of IV; 2. The range of IV is within the range of A;

3. The range of N has overlap with the range of /:l, and the range of N is higher than A;
4. The range of JV ha:s overlap with the range of A, and the range of 1V is lower than ./1; 5. The range of JV does not overlap with the range of A, and the range of N is higher

than .A; 6. The range of JV does not overlap with the range of A, and the range of N is lower than

A.
Also, the rnean value of nonnalized 1natrices (A and 1V) are derived for each colurnn.

Then, the size of two 1natrices is adjusted, if they are not the san1e size, by cutting the la.rger

83 rnatrix. Suppose the kth row of n1atri..x 1\f is considered, each elen1ent of this row can be
referred to as valtte(i, k). Also, the distance between a higher 1naxhnum. and lower minimmn of each cohnnn in A. and N are derived. The step size is derived by dividing the distance by 100. As one can see, the step size will difier fro1n column to column corresponding to the range of the distance. If one considers the kth coltunn of A and JV, the threshold value corresponding to this

column starts frorn the n1inhnum of the lower range and increases to the 1naxin1u1u of the higher range incrernentally with step size.
The ·decision vector is 1nade by corn paring value('i, k) and its corresponding threshold for each row of A and lv. Cases 1 and 2 are laid a.c;;ide because the norn1al range is within

the a.bnonnal, or vice versa, and one cannot distinguish nonnal frorn abnonnal. Other cases should be as follows:
· In case 3: if value('i, k:) <threshold, then decision_vec-tor(l, k) = -1;

· In case 4: if val·ue(i, k) < threshold, then decision_vector(l, k) =

+1;

· In case 5: if 'l.JOlue('i, k) < threshold, then decision_vec-tor(l, k) = -1 ;
· In case 6: if 1)etl·u.e(i, k) <threshold, then deci.siorLve.ctor(l, k)

= +1.

· Otherwise decisiotLvector(l, k)

=

0

Therefore, in a decision vector -1 represents the abnorn1al and

+1 represents the nonnal.

By averaging the decision vector, one can detennine whether the case (aerived frorn each row

of A and N) is norn1al or abnonnal. The decision factors, True Positive (TP), True Negative

(TN), False Positive (FP), and False Negative (FN), are derived using the follo\\7ing decision rules:
· If it is picked fron1 N and considered nonnal, add one to TP counter; · If it is picked fron1 l\l and considered abnonnal, add one to FN counter; · If it is picked fron1 A and considered abnorn1al, add one to TN counter;

84

· If it is picked frotn A and considered nonna.l, add one to FP counter.

By evaluating the deeision factors , the sensitivity and specificity are evaluated on the

basis of Equations 3.2, a.nd 3.3.

Sensitivity is plotted versus (1 - Specificity) for different thresholds and the H.eceiver

Operating Charaeteristic (ROC) plot is derived. Figure 3.27 represents the Receiver Oper-

ating Characteristic (ROC) curve of the classification of the AR. coefficients belonging to the patients who were exposed to Effexor and those who were not exposed to any antidepressant
rrwdication (Controls). The reason that this curve does not end on (1, 1) is that the decision
vector is used. If there were only one case, the decision factors (TN, TP, FP, and FN) would

have a consistent accurnulation pattern. In this case, the average of son1e of the cases become zero, which leads to ren1oval of the case fro1n Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) evaluation. Therefore, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve Ina.y not reach

(1, 1).

Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve, Method II

In this 1nethod, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was derived by conl-

puting the perforn1ance curve for classifier output. In this

n1ethod~

one EOG channel (:for

exan1ple LOC) for one type of moven1ent such as leftward was chosen for the exposed and

unexposed classification. The perfonnance curve returns the TP and FP as outputs for
plotting the classification perfo:nnance. The area under the curve (AUC) is equal to the
probability of discrin1ination; that is, the ability of the test to correctly differentiate those

who were exposed to antidepressant medication fron1 those who were not. The perforrnance of a classification is Ineasured by AUC. An area of 1.00 represents a perfect classification and 0.50 repre..-,ents a worthless one. The AUC ranges are ranked as follows,

Chapter 4 Time, Frequency, and Wavelet Analysis for Quantifying Sleep Eye Movements

A

S discussed in Chaptr 1, a significant amount of data is not evident clinically in sleep studies. l\!Ieasures of sleep physiology, not im1nediately apparent, rna.y provide

irnportant clues to diseases and responses to therapy. As stated, it has been noted that
eye n1ovmnents change significantly in the patients exposed to antidepressant 1nedications.

This chapter describes the how eye 1novexnents were different in depressed patients ''rho used antidepressant medications, con1pared to those who did not, by 1nea.ns of wavelet analysis. Electrooculogram (EOG) provides a significant an1ount of data which can be studied by

dividing it into different frequency sub-bands for analysis. The sa1ne sub-bands can then be con1part-'Cl with the sarne group of patients 1 in different sleep stages, or between diflerent
groups of patients. Spef.:ifieally in this research, the focus is on the con1parison between
patients who were exposed to antidepressant n1edica.tion a.nd those who were not. In this

chapter, the following EOG analyses , which are proposed by this research, will be discussed:
· Tirne-Domain Analysis;
e Frequency- Dornain Analysis; e Tirne and Frequency Analysis;

e Scalogram Analysis;

o Feature Extraction Using Discrete \Vavelet Transforrn.

In this chapter, two groups of five patients who were exposed to Prozac (one group called

'A', the other called 'P'), one group of five patients vvho were exposed to Celexa (called 'L'),
one group of five patients who were exposed t.o Effexor (called 'E'), one g,Toup of five patients
vvho were not exposed to antidepressant 1nedication (called 'N'), and another group of eight

patients who were not exposed to antidepressant 1nedication (called 'C') were considered. Due to confidentiality of the patient infonnation, there was no access to rnore infonnation of patients such as nan1e, gender, and age.

Tin1e-Domai11 Analysis

In the early stage of this study, the simple n1ethod tiine-dornain analysis of the eye n1overnents
has been used for a better understanding of EOG signals rather than analyzing the signals with advanced tools such as wavelet or Short Time Fourier Transforn1 analysis. In the

beginning, the a.tten1pt was to understand why the reference signals (nu1.stoid signals, Al and A2) were used. The mastoid signals represent artifacts . As was discussed in the previous chapters, the differences between LOC, ROC, and VOC and the n1astoid signals (LOC-A2, ROC-Al, and VOC-Al) were used in order to cancel the artifacts of the EOG signals. However, the a.rnplitudes of the reference signals are subtracted fro1n those of the EOG signals in such a way that the location of the electrode for · each reference signal is at the greatest distance frorn the location of the EOG. For 1neasuring the sin1ilarities between rnastoid channels and EOG channels, the crosscorrelation between one of the EOG signals and one of the n1astoid signals has been derived. Figures 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 represent the erosscorrelation of the LOC, and ROC signals with reference signals. As can be seen in the

figures, the crosscorrelation is rnaxin1u1n at the titne of zero. This conflrrns the fact that

89
subtracting these channels without any time shifting results in a cleaner EOG signal, than with a time shifting.

Further, the comparisons between the maximum crosscorrelation of the LOC, ROC, and VOC with one of the mastoid signals for those who were not exposed to antidepressant medication (called Normal patients) and those who were exposed to Prozac (called Abnormal patients) have been derived. The results are illustrated in Figure 4.5. The comparisons between the maximum crosscorrelation of the LOC with mastoid signals in different sleep stages for Normal and Abnormal patients have been derived. The results are illustrated in Figure 4.6. Also, the comparison between the maximum crosscorrelation of the ROC and VOC with mastoid signals for the same patients at different sleep stages was derived. The simple

method time-domain analysis continued with statistical analyses such as mean and variance. The mean and variance were evaluated for LOC, ROC , VOC, and mastoid signals. The results are plotted in Figure 4.7.

In conclusion, the following Tables 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, were derived from the comparing of the crosscorrelation of EOG and mastoid channels. The compared maximum crosscorrelations, which are shown in Figure 4.5, were counted, and the more frequent of the higher maximum crosscorrelations of each pair in any group of five patients were determined.
If the maximum crosscorrelation is more frequent for LOC-Al among the five patients than

LOC-A2, it will then be shown in the Table as LOC-Al > LOC-A2.

Non-stationarity of the EOG Signals and Its Solution

As was stated, the EOG signals are non-stationary. The non-stationarity of the signals was
investigated by applying then1 to an adaptive filter such as the Recursive Least Square (RLS)

algorithn1. Figure 4.8 illustrates the learning curve of the RLS algorithn1. 'l'heoretically, the
learning curve represents the output error of the adaptive fllter. If the signal is stationary, the

learning curve converges to a constant value which is the noise variance. However , Figure 4.8 shows that the learning curve converges to rnultiple values; thus, the EOG signal can not

be a stationary signal; therefore, it must be considered as a non-stationary signal. As was discussed in Chapter 2, solving the non-stationary problem of EOG signals can be achieved by signal segmentation. In that chapter, the method of fixed segmentation in which a nonstationary signal is divided into stationary or approximately stationary parts was explained; the signal should be segmented to fixed small parts whose lengths are much smaller than the length of the original signal. By this method, the produced small segments are stationary or quasi-stationary. This method was used to solve the non-stationarity of EOG signals in this research.

IVianual for the scoring of sleep and associated events recomn1ends using the

bandpass filter (0.3 to 35Flz) for EOG signals [2]. However, as one can see in Figure 4.9, the
range of frequency of the EOG signals which are processed in this research extends frorn zero to 641! z. This is because of the fact that these signals have been recorded with a sampling rate of 128 san1ples per second, which is twice the Inaxhnurn frequency, 64Hz, pursuant to the Nyquist sampling t.heorern [107]. For instance, one of the EOG signals, fron1 a patient exposed to Prozac n1edica.tion, has been plotted in tiine-doinain and frequency-do1nain, in Figure 4.9. The top one is the timedmnain representation of the signal. The tniddle figure represents the spect.run1 of the signal below the frequency of 5Hz; the first fe\\1' frequency sarnples have been rernoved for better representation of the signal, due to having large peak values at DC. 'I'he bott.on1 figure shows the complete spectrun1 of the signal, in which the 1naximu1n frequency is 64.fl z. In addition, Figure 4.9 represents a raw signal, -\'vithout any processing. By considering the different spectral plots, it is obvious that the 1nain frequency inforn1ation exists below 20fJz.

Time and Frequency Analysis

Frequeney information in particular tilne is extracted by n1eans of wavelet analysis [94]; thus, one is able to assess the transient inforn1ation in EOG signals. This infonnation can be used, first to understand the nature of the EOG signal, and second to con1pare signals of patients exposed to the 1nedication with signals of those not exposed to the 1nedication in order to distinguish the effects of antidepressant. tnedication on eye 1nove1nent signals. In this regard: wavelet transfonns were applied to EOG signals in three 1nethods: scalogra.1n analysis, slow eye n1oveinent analysis, and feature extraction.

Scalogram Analysis

101

The wavelet energy measuring procedure is called scalogram analysis, which measures the energy of a signal in a time-frequency neighborhood of fi and ti located in a resolution box, Heisenberg Box [94]. The scalogram of the signal was considered. The scalogram plots the power of each time-frequency box for different scales. Figure 4.10 represents five seconds of LOC belonging to patient C1 , who was not exposed to the antidepressant medication (Stage 1, samples 10000:10640), and Figure 4.11 shows a example of an amplitude scalogram.

The scalogram analysis was done with the the help of Log-Gabor filters, provided by Zhiatao [98]. Gabor filters are famous for their application in the localization of spatial and frequency information. Due to the Gabor filter's limitation in maximum bandwidth and because ·of not being optimal for broad spectral information, the Log-Gabor function
was proposed.

On the other hand, Log-Gabor filters can have an arbitrary bandwidth

characteristic; therefore, they are used to derive the amplitude of the scalogram.

surement has been illustrated in the right column of the graph starting from blue (0) to red dark (0.016)

The EOG signal was segmented to fixed 5-second epochs without respect to eye movements. Thereafter, the scalogram amplitude matrix of these fixed segments was evaluated. As was discussed theoretically in Chapter 2, the elements of the rows of the amplitude matrix represent the power of each time-frequency box (Heisenberg rectangle) for every scale. To find out the maximum energy for every scale, first the mean value of each row of the amplitude scalogram matrix was derived; and second, the maximum mean value was chosen. Consequently, the maximum power and its corresponding scales were found with the help of these mean values for the whole scalogram amplitude matrix. The scalogram amplitude matrices for all fixed 5-second epochs in every sleep stage were studied. The most frequent scale corresponding to maximum power was chosen for each stage; then the maximum power values of this scale were extracted from all the 5-second epochs in a sleep stage. These maximum power values of each pair of the sleep stages for a patient were determined; they were compared with the help of a classifier. A linear discriminant classifier was used in this analysis, in which the leave-one-out method is used

103 to determine the accuracy of the classification. For example, the maximum power values of Stage 1, S1, were compared to those of the Stage 2, S2, and classified. The accuracy percentages of the classification of different sleep stages then were plotted in Figure 4.12. The power results were used to compare the energy between stages of three patients who were not exposed to antidepressant medications.

The accuracy value of about 50% in patient C3 shows that there is not much difference between the power results in different stages for this patient. However, the accuracy values of about 70% of two other patients for power results in contrasting Stage 3 with Stages 1, 2, and REM are to encourage one to check this finding for other patients. Table 4.9 presents the precise accuracy results of Figure 4.12. Five other patients who were not exposed to antidepressant medications, (C4, C5, C6, C8, and C9), were considered for the same comparison, and the leave-one-out accuracy results are displayed in Figure 4.13.

The study cont]nued to find out whether such a difference in 1naxinnun energy between Stage 3 and other stages for the groups exposed to Inedication existed. In this regard, three groups of patients were considered; the patients were exposed to three types of antidepressant 1neclications: E1fexor, Celexa, or Prozac. First, the co1uparison n1ethod to find out the energy difference between Stage :3 and other stages (Stages 1, 2, and RE~I) by this 1nethod was applied to those who were exposed to Effexor rnedicat.ion. The results given in Figure 4.14 show that the energy differerlce is lower than for those patients who were not exposed to any antidepressant n1edieation. Once rnore,
it should be ernphasized that this n1ethod shows the difference between 1na.'Cin1unl energy,

derived by sealograrn, and it does not show which group has n1ore or less energy; it just shows that they are different. The reason for this con1parison is to find out the invisible dHierences between those who were exposed to antidepressant n1edieation and those who were not. The patients of this comparison were chosen randornly frorn the group exposed to Effexor rnedication. The precise results of Figure 4.14 are displayed in Table 4.11, where the leave-one-out classification a.ceuracy n-)sult.s are shovvn.

Discussion

In conclusion, by deriving the mean value of the difference between energies represented by the accuracies for each group of patients, about 70% of the accuracies Stage 3 are different from those of Stage 2 for all groups. The comparison data are displayed in Figures 4.17, and 4.18, and in Table 4.14. In addition, Table 4.14 shows the higher differences for patients who were unexposed to medication as compared to those who were exposed to any

109 antidepressant medication. In comparison of Stage 3 with Stages 1 and R (REM) , the difference was higher for those who were not exposed to the medication than for those who were exposed. As was discussed, patient C3 in the group unexposed to medication is possibly the exception in this group, perhaps due to the medical background, data recording, or other medical or technical problems. The results were reevaluated without C3 as well. The classification results of unexposed patients were increased by ignoring this patient 's data.

Slow Eye Movement Frequency Analysis Using Discrete Wavelet Transform

The EOG is a useful indicator of sleep onset. The occurrence of slow eye movements in the EOG is a sign of sleepiness. Slow Eye Movement (SEM) activity starts in pre-sleep wakefulness and linearly increases in this stage. It continues in Stage 1 and declines progressively in the first minutes of Stage 2 [110] . In this research, the detection of SEMs for these comparisons are not of interest. Presleep wakefulness and Stage 1 EOG signals are considered in order to find singularities that were demonstrated in the differences between the groups who were exposed to antidepressant medication and those who were not.

4.5.1

SEM Analysis with Consecutive Fixed Segmentation

The SEM activity analysis is based on the wavelet multiresolution analysis of sleep EOG signals. The fixed segmentation was used without respect to eye movements. In the method

111 proposed by Magosso, the EOG activities during the wake-sleep transition were analyzed to detect SEM by wavelet [111). SEMis one of the characteristics of the wake-sleep transition; therefore, it is suitable to be studied for enhancing the methods that prevent drowsiness during driving and for the diagnosing of several pathological conditions [111). By following Magosso's method, the difference between the two EOG channels [(ROC-A1)- (LOC-A2)) was decomposed by a discrete wavelet decomposer. A mother wavelet, Daubechies of order 4, proposed by Magosso, was used in this method because it resembles SEM [111). The decomposition was derived for ten levels. The detail and approximation coefficients derived from each level of decomposition were used for classification. The wavelet theory which support this method is explained in detail in Chapter 2. In this classification, linear discriminant analysis was applied for classifying those who were exposed to the medication and those who were not. The proposed method is presented in the block diagram of Figure 4.19.

Figure 4.19: The block diagram of the EOG wavelet decomposition with Daubechies of order 4 into 10 levels for classifying those who were exposed to antidepressant medication and those who were not.

Figure 4.20 represents a SEM activity. This is detected in Stage 1 of patient C1 (from the Control group who did not use the antidepressant medication). The LOC , ROC , and the difference between LOC and ROC are plotted. Eye movement is detected as SEM by the following clinical criteria: · Slow sinusoidal excursion (0.2-0.6 Hz) lasts more than one second [111)· · Its amplitude is between 20 to 200 J-LV [111);

· Antiphase deflection exists between two horizontal LOC and ROC channels [112); · Onsets of eye movements occur within 300 ms of one another [112); · Movements begin and end near zero velocity [112); · Artifacts, such as blinks or EEG /EMG artifacts, are absent. These criteria are applied by clinicians to detect SEM visually [113) [114). Figure 4.21 represents a sample of SEM activity and its ten level decompositions. The detail and approximation coefficients can be used for composing the signals by Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT), for which the evaluation is not a concern of this research. The EOG signals were sampled with the rate of 128 samples per second, which can result in the frequency range for each level of decomposition, as shown in Table 4.15.

To capture the frequency between 0.2- 0.6H z, details below scale seven were processed. T'en-level decon1position is enough because there would be no infonnation at lower frequencies.

\iVavelet decornposition were applied t.o the difference of ROC and LOC since the

difference signal had higher values than the original EOG signal in the presence of conjugate
eye synchrony. The antiphase wavefonns of ROC and LOC during the presence of conjugate eye movmnents are valuable criteria which are used by evaluating the difference of the left and right EOG signals. As one can see, the details of D8-D10 have the rnaxirnurn value in

SE:JVI detection.
The objective was to find out whether the details of slow rn.oven1ents (D8-D10) are good

features to classify the EOG signals belonging to those who were exposed to the nwdieation, and those who were not. In this regard, the levels 8 - 10 Detail coefficients were extracted and used as features to classify the patients, i.e. those exposed to the n1edicat ions (EfTexor, E, Celexa, L, or Prozae, P), a.nd those unexposed (Control, C).

Discussion
The DvVT coefficients in Stage 1 do not shovv any remarkable difference between the dassi_ fied groups of patients. This could be due to the large nurnber of noise level signals that were

cornpared for both groups, exposed and unexposed to the rnedica.tion, in the classification.

On the other hand, the result may irnply that the waveforrr1s of the signal in tenns of S.E:l\1s

117 have not been affected by this type of medication. In other words, the detail coefficients corresponding to SEM (D8-D10) does not show any difference, which means that the waveform amplitudes of classified groups with fixed segmentation are not much different.

4.5.2

SEM Analysis using EMDS

Instead of consecutive fixed segmentation, Eye Movement Detection Software (EMDS) was used to detect eye movements, and then the classification was made with the same procedure as in the previous subsection. The size of the considered segment is 501 samples, 250 samples before and 250 samples after detected movement, as well as the detected sample. Daubechies of order 4 with 10 level decomposition was used and only D8-D10 was classified to show the difference of the SEM waveforms of patients exposed and unexposed to medication. Figure 4.23 and Table 4.18 represent the accuracy results of this comparison.

There was an in1provernent of lOo/c; in the accuracies of the classificat.ion as a result of taking into consideration the ·eye n1overnents.

In the previous case, one of the possible causes

of low accuracies was due to the large rnunber of segrnents, with no eye moven1ent. By using EI\1DS , one can see that the results hnprove. Especially in the case of Prozac and Control patients, the accuracy increases to approxirna.tely 70%. The accuracy resulted frorn the classification represents t,he accuracy of the correctly assigned nutuber of the cases to their classes. In this case, this accuracy of approxin1a.tely 70% htdicates that the difierence between the wavefonns of detected n1overnents of the sleep eye rnove1nents of the patients who were exposed to antidepressant 1nedica.tion and those who were not is rerrta.rkable. In other words, the details (D8-D10) derived frorn the correlation between the n1other wavelet and the detected n1overnents are classified. T'he accuracy result of this classification represents that how the classifier has been successful in differentiating the detail coefficients. If the accuracy were 100%, it would Inean that the difference between the coeHicients was n1uch, so the detail coefficients of one of the classes are very shnilar to 1nother wavelet and the other are not. Therefore, the accuracy of the classification shows the difference between the wa.veforn1s of the detected n1overnents for the patients who were exposed to n1edication and those who were not. This also shows that sleep eye 1noven1ents, which are unconscious eye xnovernents controlled by the brain, have been affected largely by the exposure to Prozac. Therefore, Serotonin controlled by Prozae afieets eye 1novements by changing the wa.vefonns of the

Feature Extraction Using DWT

As was discussed in Chapter 2, the Wavelet Transfonn (WT) is used for addressing the non-stationary signal problmns, describing a tiine-domain signal in tern1s of coefficients. These coefficients show the correlation bet.ween the rnother wavelet and the signal for each scale. In other words, a signal will be described in tenns of building blocks that are the farnily of functions, derived fron1 a single generating function called a 1nother wavelet, by translating and dilating operation. One of the advantages of vVT is that it works on varying window sizes. This property may allow the analysis to have a better perfonnance than other transfonns such as Fourier rn·ansfonn (FT) or Short Thne Fourier Transform (STFT). \VT uses varying sizes of broad windows for low and high frequencies. 'Thus, the signal can be described in an opthnal tin1e-frequency resolution in aU frequency ranges. This m.eans that vVT can detect the transient inforrnation of the non-stationary signals. The specification of time and frequency localization is one of the 1uain feature.'3 of vVT. The \VT of a signal is the decornposition of the signal over the translation and dilation of mother wavelets {97]. VVT can be used to extract features frorn EOG, by perfonuing a spectral analysis of the signal. These features charaeterize the EOG wavefonns. Therefore, they can be used to reflect the antidepressant rnedication effects that are not apparent to clinicians [97].

Feature Extraction Using DWT Matrix, without Grouping

As was discussed in Chapter 1, the EOG signal is considered to be 11seful in deriving the infonnation of sleep eye 1noven1ents. The analysis of EOG signals are in1portant for neurologists and psychologists in order to assess the brain functionality. In this research, the atternpt is to track the efrects of antidepressant n1edkation (SSRI and SNRI) on sleep eye n1ovements. Since eye Inoveinent recording during sleep is a non-invasive method, it vvould be 1nore worthy if one could find the relat.ionship between the EOG and Serotonin re-upta.king

120
behaviour. Thus, EOG can extract valuable infonnation, for neurologists and psychiatrists. A shnple way to display the differences between those who
wen~

exposed to nwdication

and those who were not, is to conduct a spectral analysis. The \VT provides general techniques for n1any tasks, such as bion1edica.l signal analysis. One Technique is the ability to cornpute and manipulate data in features. with features being defined as rnanipulated data in cornpressed pararneters. Therefore, EOG signals can be co1npressed into the pararneters, and be characterized in order to study the behaviour of the EOG signals. These features use the less of para1neters to represent EOG signals, and they are hnporta.nt for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. As described in Chapter 2, the vVT can be thought of as an extension of the elassic Fourier transfonn which works on a rnulti-sca.le basis, rather than working on a single scale (time-do1nain or frequency-domain). This rnulti-scale feature of vVT decornposes a signal into a number of scales; ea.ch scale represents singularities of the signal in a particular sub-band [97]. The procedure of nm.ltiresolution decornposition used in \VT was described in Cha,pter 2. The EOG signals can be decomposed to different structures occurring at different time-

scales. In other word, it is a superposition of different tirne-seale structures. One of the
purposes of wavelet analysis is to deco1npose the signals to different levels of thne-scale structures for further analysis. This 1nethod is very suitable for non-stationary signals such as EOG because it is able to localize tirne and frequency precisely. This thne frequency localization property of wavelets is kno\vn as compact su.ppo-rt, which is one of the rnost a.ttra.ctive features in \VT. Having such a precise tilne frequency localization characteristic is due to the fact that vVT uses a variety of window sizes, instead of fixed windows. The selection of an appropriate nwther wavelet and the number of deeornposition levels are very irnportant in wavelet analysis. In this case, the rnother wavelet of Coifiet of order 3, which was proposed by Ayush Bhandari, was used [115]. The rnunber of decon1position levels was chosen as eight levels. Table 4.19 shows the frequency range of each level of decon1position. According to this table, the infonnation under 0.25Hz exists in AS. On the other ha.nd, due to the use of a. lowpass filter with a cutoff frequency of 0.311 z during

121 clinic recordings, further decon1positions n1ay not be useful. Also, it is not necessary to

evaluate the lower frequencies because do1ninant frequencies do not exist below 8-level of deco1npositions [115)"

The D\VT provides a co1npact representation of the energy distribution of EOG signals in time and frequency doiuain. Therefore, the con1puted wavelet coefficients, DvVTs, are considered feature vectors which represent the signals.

was used to detect the 1noven1ent. An1ong the four types of 1noven1ents, leftward,

rightward, upward, and downward, the leftward 1novmnent was considered in this section. Also among the three EOG signals, LOC was chosen for this analysis. In other words, LOC signal parts containing leftward rnoven1ents were analyzed. There is no restriction on the selection of any types of n1ovmnent or any EOG channel, and the n1ethod can be expanded to other 1noven1ents and channels as well. In this section, because of the con1putat.ional tin1e and con1plexity of EOG signals, only a part of the data was considered. The fixed segrnents of 501 sarnples containing eye rnovements were chosen (250 smnples before and 250 smnples after the detected Inovernent, as well
a.;;

the detected san1ple). These

segrnents were decornposed to 8-levels by the CoiHet of order 3 a.s their Inot.her wavelet.
The detail wavelet coefficients (Dl, D2, D8, D4, D5~ D6, D7, and D8) at the first, second,

third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth levels have the 259, 138, 77, 47, 32, 24, 20,

122
and 18 coefficients respectively, and the .approxin1ation (A8) has 18 coefficients. By this

\Vay, (t3a wavelet coefficients were derived. Although Dl, D2, are not in the range of the desired frequency (0- 15Jfz), the din1ensionality of the extracted feature vector is still big.
In order to reduce the dhnensionality of the feature vectors, statistics, over the set of wavelet coefficients, were derived. The st.at.istkal features that \vere used are as follows:

123 Furthermore, the frequency distribution are represented by features 1 and 2 in Equation 4.1 and 4.2. The amount of changes in frequency distribution are represented by feature 3 and 4 in Equation 4.3 and 4.4 . After deriving the detected movements for each patient and conducting the segmentation, the wavelet coefficients of segmented vectors was computed. The mean absolute value,

average power, standard deviation, and the ratio of absolute mean values of adjacent subbands were evaluated for each decomposition level of each patient. The final feature result provides a vector for each patient. Therefore, five vectors were assigned to five members of the group who were exposed to antidepressant medication and five vectors were assigned to five patients who were not exposed to antidepressant medication. These vectors were used to classify the patients by the linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Figure 4.24 displays the leave-one-out method accuracy results of LDA classification.

However, the low accuracies in the leave-one-out method implies that there is not much difference between the selected features for patients who were exposed to medication and those who were not. In other words, the information might be lost in deriving average values for most of the features.

However, the main reason for the poor results could be due to the low number of comparisons. Only five feature vectors of the patients who were exposed to antidepressant

medications were compared with five feature vectors of those who were not. Also, making the average of all values to derive the feature vector might have caused inaccurate results. This means the information about the differences between the patients who were exposed and those who were not exposed to antidepressant medication may be removed by averaging or by evaluating the standard deviation for the entire matrix.

4.6.2

Feature Extraction Using DWT Matrix, by Grouping

126

To solve the low accuracy problem of the feature extraction from the matrix, as a whole (see Section 4.6.1), the features are derived from the matrix by grouping the data. After deriving the matrix of coefficients, instead of evaluating the features directly from the entire matrix, they are evaluated from each group of five rows of the matrix. The five leftward eye movement wavelet coefficients that comprise a part of this matrix, derived from LOC, were used as a group in feature extraction. By this method, the mean of the absolute values, average power, standard deviation, and ratio of absolute mean values of adjacent sub-bands, are evaluated for each nonconsecutive 25 seconds (because the detected eye movements are not in consecutive time) from their corresponding wavelet coefficients. This corresponds to wavelet coefficients derived from five movements that each of which takes five seconds. Therefore, each derived feature matrix corresponds to one level of decomposition, and includes all four features. Figures 4.26, 4.27, 4.28, 4.29, 4.30, 4.31, 4.32, and 4.33 display the results.

4.6.3

Discussion

The leave-one-out method has fewer numeric values than the regular method, but it provides more reliable results. As this research is interested in extracting the result from the differences between the patients, the accuracy rate, which is in the range of 65% to 75%, seems to be a good indication of those differences (see Figures 4.26, 4.27, 4.28, and 4.29 ). By looking at the leave-one-out results, one can understand that D8, which contains the 0.25H z to 0.5H z frequencies, has the maximum accuracy for Stage 1 (see Figure 4.26). This means that in this frequency sub-band the differences between the patients are most clearly revealed, in regards to a mean absolute value feature. There is a maximum difference in the mean absolute value features. 81 with 71% accuracy (see Table 4.22) , 83 with almost 69% (s~ Table 4.24), 82 with 65% (see Table 4.23) show that the waveform of the signal for

analysis, In other words, EQ(j can detect SSRis effects, and this rnethod is able to detect the

SSRI behaviour through EOG signals. However, n1ean absolute values in Stage R.El\11. show
accuracy is too low (50%) to differentia,t,e eA.1X)Sed and unexposed patients (seeFigure 4:.29).

In Stage 1 (see Figure 4.26), the rneans of absolute values show about 70%, a,cTuracy in the classification for D8, 07, and D6. This rneans that there a.re differences in the frequency
range of 0.25- 2liz between the patients who were exposed and unexposed to antidepressant

n1edieation. Standard deviations, whieh in this case show the range of deviation in each subband, represent rnaxinnnn differences in the range of 0.2,5 - 1/Jz (D8 and D7). Although,

about GOo/c; accuracies in classification do not represent significant differences, the average

65% accuracy in this case represents a. kind of existence of differences

betwt~-:;n

deviations in

the DvVT coefficients, rrhis accuracy rate represents the difference between the waveforn1 of the signal atrected by rnedication exposure and was not initially evident in the signal.
In Stage 1 (see Figure 4.26), the "all features" have 72%-75% accuracy in ditTerentiating
between exposed and unexposed patients. Furthennore, when all features, ( rnean of absolute, average power, standard deviation, and ratio) were used for classification, the accuracy percentage was increased as expected. In Stage 2 (see Figure 4.27), the classification accuracies of the "average power" feature are about 74% on average. Also, the "all features" shows the aceuraey of above 70% in this stage, In Stage 3, the "average power" sho\vs 75% accuracy with the leave-one-out nwthod in D8 (frequency range of 0.25- 0.5H z'), and 77% in D7 (frequency range of 0.5- lllz). In other frequency sub-bands the derived the leave-one-out n1ethod accuracies are 67% and 6:39{;, which show a diH'erence in the power of the DWT coefficients (see Table 4,24),

In Stage 3, the "all features~' calculation has a lTm.xirmun accuracy of 77% in the leave-oneout n1ethod, both in A8 (frequency range of 0- 0.2511z) and in D5 (frequency range of2-

4ll z), This means that if all four features are considered, the accuracy rate irnproves to 70%

135
and above perhaps due to the fact that if the feature vector din1ensionality increa'jes, then
the classifier perfonnance hnproves. This n1eans that t.he difference between the waveforn1

representatives (D\VT coefficients), for the patients who \vere exposed and unexposed the antidepressant n1edication are distinguished better with an accuracy rate of about 70% and above (see Figure 4.28).

In Stage RE1v1, there are not. 1nany differences between the features. "IVIean of absolute
value",
'~standard

deviation", and "ratio" for patients who were exposed and unexposed

to rr1edication show an accuracy rate of the leave-one-out method a.t about 50%, which indicates that the difference is minimal (see Figure 4.29). However, "average power" has an accuracy of about 64.2% on average. Also, the accuracy of "all (entire) features" is 71% for
D7 (frequency range of 0.5- 1Hz) and 70% for D8 (frequency range of 0.25- 0.5lFz). D5

(frequency range of 2- 4H.z) has an accura.cy of 67% and D6 (frequency range of 1- 21{ z)

ha.s the least accuracy rate of 65% (see Table 4.25). In conclusion, the "mean of absolute value" is a good criterion only for Stage 1, and
"Average Power" is good for all stages except for Stage 1. Although "Standard Deviation" and "Ratio'' do not achieve positive results, both are significant in "all feature" accuracies; i.e., by re1noving each of these two features, the accuracies will decrease. Further assessn1ent of depression and related Inedica.tive states can be conducted by using neural networks, adaptive segn1entation, and adaptive rnother wavelet selection. Neural

networks can improve the classification results by in1plen1enting linear discriininants in a space where the inputs of classification are nonlinear; i.e., the nonlinearity of the input of the classification can be resolved by using neural networks. Adaptive filters such as Kalrnan

filter, Hysteresis filter [109], or fast least square algorithrns [116] can be used for EOG
segrnentation. Adaptive mother wavelet selection also can be used to detect the different wavefornlS of sleep eye 1noven1ents. By this rnethod, one n1ay be ·able to distinguish the pathological waveforrr1s fro1n non-pathological waveforms in the EOG signals.

Conclusions

S

LEEP is a. necessary part of hun1an existenc(.',. Sleep disorders have a great iinpact on the well-being of hurnan life. lVIore than 50 million Arnericans suffer frorn sleep dis-

orders. These disorders hinder hurnan daily function and affect health and longevity [2] Jn
the last three decades, academic studies on sleep have found a large number of connections
between sleep and physical and n1ental well-being. The physiological infonnation recorded frorn patients during sleep is invaluable for scientists, especially for neurologists a.nd psychiatrists. \Vhile sleep clinicians use sleep infonnat.ion in clinical rna.nagem.ent, there is a. wealth of inforn1ation that is not apparent on casual visual inspection, even for experts [12]. However, 1nore invaluable physiological infonnation can be achieved through 1nathernatical and technical n1ethods. In other words, further processing will help clinicians to utilize invaluable inforrna.tion that. is not readily available to then1 in routine sleep studies. lVIea.c:mres of sleep physiology not obvious to the human eye n1ay provide itnporta.nt dues to disease states and its response to therapies.

Sleep disorders frequently coexist with other medical and psychiatric conditions (e.g.,
cardiovascular disease, depression, or diabetes), and they are affected by ditTerent, medication exposure; Le., hannful effects. Furthennore, tnany sleep state changes have been observed in clinical depression studies (reduced activity), with respeet to 1nedication exposure [38]. Thus, it becomes evident that n1edications are significant in sleep studies. lVIost patients with depression experience sleep disturbance that 1nay be a.ccon1pa.nied

136

137 by excessive sleeplessness or insonu1ia. The characteristics of sleep disturbance in patients
with depression can be useful for treatrnent. Furthennore, xnany n1ethods are used .to treat these patients nowadays. Exposure to antidepressant 1nedieations such as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRis) and serotonin norepinephrine re-tlptake inhibitors (SNRis), has recently beeorne a connnon method [:37]. This thesis has described how sleep eye Inovements were different in depressed patients who used antidepressant 1nedications cmnpared to those who did not. This study attempts to present
thf~

antidepressant rnedications' effects on sleep eye movmnents. Clinically used

SSRis sueh as Prozac (with the generic nmne of Fluoxetine), Celexa (with the generic narne of Citaloprarn), and Zoloft (with the generic na1ne of Sertraline), and SNRis such as Effexor (with the generic name of Venlafaxine) were eonsidered in this study to assess the possible connections between eye rnovm:nents recorded during sleep and serotonin effects. The novelty of this research is in the assessrnent of sleep eye Inovmnents in order to track the antidepressant 1nedica.tions' eff<:.x:., ts on the brain, through the EOG channels. EOG analysis is valuable because it is a noninvasive n1ethod of study, and the research at hand is looking for findings that have been invisible to the eyes of professional clinicians. This research shows that the is a rmnarkable dHierence betwc'en the wavefonns of sleep eye rnovements for the patients who were exposed to n1edication and those who were not. This difference is not evident in routine sleep studies because the EOG signals are too long.

The Contributions

To quantify and assess the effects of antidepressant 1nedication on sleep eye nwvEnnents, the following contributions were n1ade: · The eye n1overnent detection software (EiviDS) was written for detecting sleep eye n1ove1nents through EOG signals. · Autoregressive (AR) modelling and wavelet analysis were used for classifying sleep eye movenwnts of those who were exposed to antidepressant rnedication and those who

138 were not. The contributions of this research can be su1nn1arized as two rna.in categories, technical

and clinical.

Clinical Contributions
The clinical contribution of this research was the develop1nent of Eye .lVloven1ent Detection Sofhva.re (El\!IDS). This software was used to quantify sleep eye rnovmnents: and it has the

following features:
· Band Pass Filter: An FRI filter in the frequency range of 0.3 - 20.H z with the order of 200 was used to rernove artifacts;
e Verification Plot: All detected 1novernents are plotted in pre-process and post-process
figm~es,

including all EOG channels for verification that can be used by clinicians;

· Returning Eye 1\!Iovernent 'Time Duration: The tirne durations of detected eye Inove-

lnents are returned" These time durations, which are categorized into two rna.in categories: slow eye Inovenwnts and fast eye Inovernents, are the clinical eoncerns in sleep studies; · Returning Ot.her Eye lVIovmnent Spec:ifica.t.ions: This software also returns the other

spedfieations of dete<.-:ted eye n1oven1ents such as tirne index and rnaxilnurn mnplitude

of the detected rnovernents for each EOG channel.
The El\IIDS and the narned features of this software can be used for further analysis such

as quantification and classification of detected rnovernents in clinical studies.

Technical Contributions

The technical contribution of this research is surnrnarized in two sections: AR tnodelling and wavelet analysis of EOG signal. In both Inethods, linear diserirninant classifiers were used to evaluate differences bet\veen the waveforms of sleep eye tnovernents for the patients who were exposed to a.ntidepressant 1nedication and of those who were not.

139
Autoregressive Analysis

'rhe 1nethodology, which was used for the classification of the sleep eye Inovement of· the patients who were exposed to the Proza.c (antidepressant) rnedieation, and of those who \vere not, was to derive AR n1odellingo The AR coefficients of fixed seg:tnents, including the detected eye rnovements, were derived. The signal was segrnented because EOG is a non-stationary signal, and seginentation Inakes each segn:1ent becorne stationary or quasistationary. The optin1u1n n1odel order was 27 derived by the 1ninirnu:tu square error inspect,ion. The results were classified with a linear diserhninant function. Then, the classification overall average accuracy rate was detern1ined to be 82.8% [12]. Thereafter, the 1nethodology wa.'3 developed by using th.e in1proved eye 1novement detection software and deriving the optin1utn AR n1odel order by en1ploying the Akaike InforUlation Criterion (AIC) n1ethod [108]. Other groups of patients were tested. Groups 1 and 2, each inclucled five patients who used Celexa and Effexor, respectively, co:rnpared to five patients not taking any a.ntidepressants. AR coefficients of sleep eye n1oven1ents belonging to each group were derived and classified using linear discrhnina.nt analysis. The rnodel order was also 27 evaluated by AIC method. The overall averages of the regular tnethod accuracies were 76.4% and 78.7% for groups 1 and 2, respectively. The overall averages of the leave-one-out method accuracies were 75.5% and 77.5% for the smne groups (117]. Finally, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was evaluated for the autoregressive n1odelling rnethod. This rnethod evaluates the perforrnance of a n1ethod by rneasuring the area, under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The area under the curve (AUC) is equal to the probability of discrhnination; that. is the ability of the test to correctly distinguish those who were exposed to antidepressant nwdication fron1 those who were not. An area of 1.00 represents a perfect classification and 0.50 represents a worthless one. The AUC ranges are ranked as follows [118]:
· 0.90- 1.00 = Excellent;
· 0.70-0.90 =Good;

140
e 0.60- 0. 70

= Poor;

· 0.50- 0.60

= Fail.

As was shown in Subsection 3.3.4, 82.17% derived for AUC represents a "good" evaluation for this autoregressive n1ethod.

AR coefficients represent the wa.veforn1s of sleep eye rnove1nents. Therefore, the classification of AR coefficients of patients who were expos~'Cl to n1edication and of those who were not
represents the differences between their waveforrns. In this research, the achieved aeeura.des,

which are above 70% in average, dernonstrate the differences between the wavefonns of sleep
eye 1nove1nents of the patients who were exposed to antidepressant medication and those who were not. The results dmnonstrate that eye Inovernents can be quantified and characterized with this approach. This method will allow the develop1nent of new 1netrics that

may assist in disease classification and response t.o t.reat1nent, in a variety of neuropsychiatric
conditions.

The following discussion points should be considered, 1. In earlier studies, the AR Inodel order of 2 was used for EOG· analysis [109]. However,
the 111odel order of 2 n1ay not be accurate enough for this research. Therefore, the optinmm rnod.el order of 27 was derived using two n1ethods: the 1nininnun square error inspection, and the AIC rnethod. The con1plexity .of the AIC rnethod was less than the cornplexity of the n1inhnum square error inspection.

2. All-pole n1odels are the special structures that rnake algorithrns fast and efficient for finding the all-pole pararneters [99]. A1nong different types of a.lgorith1ns for all-pole
rnodelling, the Burg rnethod was chosen because it always produces a stable rnodel and it handles short data records well [119). However, the Burg 1nethod does not perfonn wen for noisy data [119].

:J. LDA classification is recon1n1ended for rnost clinical applications [120]. LDA classification is sin1pler than other classifiers such as neural networks. Although the use of rnore

141 advanced classifiers, such a.s n(mral networks, rnay increase the accuracy rates, the ac-

curacy results frmn LDA classifications were above

70~~

in rnost of the cases, which

\-vas satisfactory. However, simpler classifications such as k-1nea.n clustering were tried in this research and the results were not satisfactory.

Wavelet Analysis
The scalogran1 analysis, Section 4.4, explained that the EOG signal was segrnented to fixed 5second epochs, with no respect to the inclusion of eye 1novernents. Thereafter, the scalogrmn

a1npUtude matrix of these fixed segrnents was eva..luated. As was discussed theoretically
in Chapter 2, the elen1ents of the rows of the an1plitude ruatrix represent the energy of each thne-frequeney box (Heisenberg rectangle) for each scale. To find out 1naxin1tun

energy for each scale, the 1nean value of ea,ch row of the atnplitude scalogran11natrix, which corresponds to the energy in that scale, was derived. Consequently, the 1na.xinunn energy and its corresponding scales were determined with the help of these n1ean values, for each scale. In the results section, we conduded that the energy difference, derived fron1 the scalogra1n, has an accuracy rate of approximately 70% in cornparing Stages 2 and 3. The con1parison data is presented in Figures 4.17 and 4.18, and in Table 4.14. Also, Table 4.14 in Chapter 4 clearly shows the greater differences for patients who were unexposed to 1nedication as con1pared to those who were exposed to any rnedication. In co1nparison between Stage 3 with Stages 1 and REl\II, the difference was greater for those who were not exposed to nwdication than for those who were. As discussed, patient C3, who is in the group of patients unexposed to antidepressant rnedication, is possibly the a.no1naly in this group, perhaps due to n1edical background, data recording, or other 1nedical or teehnical problen1s. The results vvere reevaluated \Vithout C3 as well. The classification accuracy increased when cunitting this patient's data. In Section 4.5, two rnethods of using consecutive fixe<i segrnentations and fixed segnlentations that include the detected movmnents were described. First, consecutive fixed segrnentations were used without respect to rnoven1ents. The first a.lgorithxn wa:;; based on

142
vvavelet Inultiresolution analysis. The difference between the two EOG channels [(ROC- A.l) - (LOC-A2)J was given to the ·wavelet ck>eornposer; 1\tiother wavelet Da.ubechies of order 4 was used in this regard. It was derived fro1n the literature on sleep Slow Eye Moven1ent (SEl\:1) detections [111]. It was concluded that the Discrete \Vavelet Transfonn (DvVT) coefficients in Stage 1 n1ay not represent any differences
betwt:~en

the classified groups vv·ith

this n1ethod or they rnay have no differences at alL In other words, the Detail coeJfidents
corresponding t.o SEl\·1 (D8-D10) do not show any difference, \vhich n1eans that the wavefonn

an1plitudes of dassifl<:xl groups with consecutive fixed segrnentation (H)-second or 30-second)
do not show n1uch difference. Further, the reason can be due to considering a large nu1nber of segn1ents in each gToup that only contain noise. In fact , the accuracy decreases if a large number of noisy segments are classified. Sel..:ond, instead of fixed segn1entation, E:NIDS was
usf~d

to detect the eye rnovernents, and

then the dass.ificat.ion wa.s 1nade. The size of the considerE-'<1 segrnent was about 501 sarnple..'),

including 250 samples before and 250 sarnples after the detected n1oven1ent. IVIother wavelet
Daubechies of order 4 with 10-level decornpositions was used, and only D8-D10 was clas-

sified to show the difierences between SEIVI wavefonns of patients exposed and unexposed
to n1edication. Figtu·e 4.23 and Table 4.18 represent the accuracy results of this cornparison. The decornposition was derived for 10 levels. The details and approxilnations of each level were sent to a linear discrin1inant classifier for classifying those who were exposed to tuedication and those who were not. The block diagrarn of the rnethod was presented in Figure .:L 19. In this diagran1, it was concluded that there is an ilnprovernent of 109{) in the results

if the fixed segn1ent.ations induding the

segrnentations, one of the possible causes for the low accuracies was the consideration of a large nurnber of segments without any eye 1novernent, i.e., they are only noises. However, the accuracy results were hnproved by only considering the segrnents that include eye rnovernents. The Eye 1\!Iovmnent Detection Software (EIVIDS) was used in this regard. Especially, in

143 the case of Prozac and Control classification, the difference between the wavefonn of those signals has grown up to 70% in accuracy. This shows that ·SErvi, which are unconscious Inovements controlled b.Y the brain, were affected 1 probably, by the exposure to Prozac. Because of using D8- DlO decornpositions in the analysis, it can be concluded that Prozac has an effect on eye rnovements by changing the waveforn1 of the signal at low frequencies. In Section 4.6, two Inethods using four statistical features were discussed: L l\!Iean of the absolute values of the coefficients in each sub-band; 2. Average power of the wavelet coefficients in each sttb-band; 3. Sta. ndard deviation of the coefficients in each sub-band; 4. Ra.tio of absolute n1ea.n values adjacent sub-bands.

In the first n1ethod, the features were derived using the DWT Inatrices without grouping (see Section 4.6.1). The accuracies were low (see Figures 4.24) because a low nuxnber of comparisons in the classification were rnade; i.e., five feature vectors of the five patients who were exposed to antidepressant n1edication and five fea.ture vectors of five patients who \Vere not exposed. In the second rnethod, instead of evaluating the four above features fron1 the 111atrix, as a whole (see Section 4.6.1), they were evaluated frorn the matrix by grouping the data.
f(~atures

were evaluated by grouping eaeh of the five rows of t.he wavelet coefficients 1natrix, move1nent wavelet coefficients.

where the eoefficients.in the rnatrix correspond to leftward

\Vith this rnethodj the rnean of the absolute values 1 average power, standard deviation, and ratio of absolute rnean values of adjacent sub-bands were evaluated for each inconsecutive 25second period (i.e., detected n1ovet.nents have different thne indices), frorn their corresponding wavelet coefllcients. Thjs corresponds to wavelet
cof~ffidents

derived frorn five 1noven1ents

each of which takes .five seconds. Thus, each rnatrix of features corresponds to one level of decomposition and includes all four statistical features. \rVith this 1nethod the following conclusions were drawn:

144
· The leavc,'-one-out rnethod has fewer nurneric: values than the regular rnethod, and it provides n1ore reliable results. Asthis research is interested in extracting the differences that characterize the patients, the accuracy rate which has increased fron1 65% to

7"5% seen1s to be a good indication of those differences. By looking at the leave-oneout H'--Sults (see the figures of Section 4.6.2), one can understand that D8 , which contains the 0.25Ilz to 0.5Hz frequeneies, has the highe..;;;t accuracy for Stage 1 (Sl) (see Figure 4.26). This rneans that in this frequency sub-band the differences of the patients are n1ost dearly revealed, with regards to a "nwan absolute value" feature. The leave-one-out accuracy was rnaxirnun1 for D8 in the "mean of absolute value" feature of Sl, 8:.3, and 82. Sl with a 71% difference (sc>e Table 4.22) , 83 with alrnost
69%, (see Table 4.24), and S2 with 65%~ (see Table 4.23) show that the waveforn1s

of the signals for patients who were exposed to n1edication are different from those of patients \rv-ho were not. Tl1e differentiation between the patients sin1ply irnplies the idea of detection of antidepressant 1nedkations' effects by EOG analysis. In other words, EOG can detect SSRI efreets, and this 1nethod is capable of detecting SSRI behaviour through the EOG signals. However, the n1ean absolute values in Stage R.E1\J1 do not show enough accuracy (they are about 50o/ci) to differentiate patients who were exposed to antidepressant 1nedication fro1n those who were not (see Figure 4.29). · In Stage 1 (see Figure 4.26), the rneans of absolute values show about 70% accuracy in the classification for D8, D7, and D6. This Ineans that. there are differences in the frequency range of 0.25- 21-1 z between the patients who were exposed and unexposed to antidepressant rnedieation. Standard deviations, which in this case show the range of deviation in each sub-band, represent 1naxinnun differences in the range of 0.25 1!l z (D8 and D7). Although, about 607<) accuracies in classification do not represent

a significant difference, the average 65o/c) accuracy in this case represents a, kind of existence of differences between deviations in the DvVT coefficients. This accuracy rate represents the difference betwc:.en the waveforrn of the signal affected by nwdication exposure, which was not apparent in the signal at first.

145
e In Stage 1, the "all featuresn have 72%- 75% accuracy in differentiating between the

patients exposed and unexposed to 1nedieation. Furthenno:re, when all features (1nean of absolute, a.vera.ge power, standard deviation, and ratio) were used for classification, the accuracy rate increased, perhaps due to the fact that if the dhnension of the feature vector
®

increasf~s, tlu~

classifier performance hnproves (see Figure 4.26).

In Stage 2, t.he classification accuracy of tlw "a,verage power" feature was about 74% on average. Also, an "all features" calculation ga.ve an aceuracy of above stage (see Figure 4.27).
70%~

in this

o

In Stage 3, "average power" showed 75o/c, accuracy with the leave-one~out rnethod in D8 (frequency range of 0.25- 0.5l:lz), and 77% in D7 (frequency range of 0.5- 1Hz). In other frequency sub-bands the derived leave-one-out 1nethod accuracies were 67% and

():3%, which show a difference in the power of the D\VT coefficients (see Figure 4.28).
e In Stage 3, ''all features" had a n1axin1un1 a,ceuracy of 77% in the lea.ve-one-out Inethod,

both in A8 (frequency range of 0- 0.25H z) and in D5 (frequency range of 2-4Hz). This n1ea,ns that if all four features a:re considered, the accuracy rate will hnprove to 70% and above. Purther, this rneans that the differences between the wavefonn representatives (D\VT coefficients) for the patients exposed and unexposed to 1nedication are distinguished 1nuch better, with au accuracy rate of about 709(, and above (see Figure 4.28).
o

In Stage REfvi, the "1nean of absolute value", "standard deviation'', and "ratio'' features did not show rnany differences between patients exposed and unexposed to Inedication beca.use the leave-one-out method showed an accuracy rate of about 50%, which indicates that the difference is n1inhnal (see Figure 4.29). However, "average power" had an accuracy of about 64.2% on average. Also, the accuracy of (all [entire] features) was 71%) for D7 (frequency range of 0.5- 1Hz) and 70% for D8 (frequency range of
0.25- 0.5H z). D5 (frequency range of 2- 4H.z) had an accuracy of 67% and D6

(frequeney range of 1- 2JI z) had the least accuracy, at 65<;{) (see Table 4.25).

146

According to the above results, one ca.n conclude that the "1nean oLabsolute value" is a good criterion only for Stage 1, and ''Average Power" is good for all stages except for Sta.ge 1. Although "Standard Deviation'' and ''Ratio" do not achieve positive results, both
axe significant. in ('all feature" accura.cies; i.e. , by retnoving e~:teh of these two features , the

accura.cies will decrease.

Coinparison between Autoregressive Analysis and Wavelet Analysis

AR analysis is an established method for rnodeling the physical process such as sleep eye
movernents. Also the Burg algorithn1 that was used for deriving AR coeflidents is fast

and efficient.

The higher accuracy was derived by AR modelling analysis than wavelet

analysis. However, wavelet analysis can detect the singularities of the sleep eye n1ove1nents rnore efficient. than AR n1odelling. Wavelet analysis can assess the transient infonnation and extract the frequency inforrnation in particular tin1e. vVavelet analysis :tna.p thetin1e dornain signal inforrnation recorded on polyson1nogran1s to thne-frequency dornain. Therefore, it adds one dirnension to the signal, so it has 1nore ability than AR 1nodelling to extract new infonuation useful to clinicalapplica.tions. Also, in this research wavelet analysis was faster than AR modelling.

The future work can be sun1marized as follows:
:El\tiDS~

whieh was used to detect the eye

move~nents,

can be developed further for better

eye rnovernent detection. This software can evaluate rnore accurate tilne durations of sleep eye n1overnents. An1ong the four types of n1oven1ents, leftward, rightward, upward, and downward, the horizontal 1noven1ents were considered in this research; t.hat can be extended to verticals. Tinw durations also can be categorized into rnore classes than the two classes of slow and fast 1novernents used in this study. Further, by using autoregressive rnodelling (AR), instead of A.R coefficients, pole analysis can be used for broader analysis.

147 In the feature selection part of wavelet analysis, a: mong the three EOG signals, LOC

was chosen for further analysis.

In other

words~

LOC signal parts, containing leftward

movernents: were analyzed. There is no restriction in selection of any types of rnoven1ents, or any EOG channel, and the rnethod can be expanded to the others in future work. In this section, because of the computational tirne and con1plexity of EOG signals, the data were partially considered. Thus, the rnethod (explained in Section 4.6) can be expanded to the data recording for the rightward, upward, and downward Inovernents, and to ROC and VOC channels. In future work, the filtering of EOG signals can be hnproved as well. A.da,ptive filters rnay be used in this regard. Ada.pt;ive filtering can be used for cancelling other channels such as EEG, ECG, or abdornen artifacts. Also in the wavelet analysis 1nethod, adaptive windowing can be used for different detected eye rnoven1ents. Adaptive n10ther wavelets can also be used for different wa.vefonns of eye n1ovmnents by deteeting the nonnal and a.bnonna.l wa.vefonns of eye n1overnents in categorizing the \vavefonns, and confirrning the results with clinicians. By this rnethod, the pathological wavefonus can he distinguished frorn non-pathological wavefonns in the EOG signals. Further assessrnent of depression and related n1edicat.ive states can be conducted by using neural networks, adaptive segrnenta.t.ion, and adaptive ntother wavelet selection. Neural networks can lrnprove the classification results by hnplementing linear discriminants in a. space where the inputs of the classification are nonlinear; i.e., the nonlinearity of the input of the dassifleation can be resolved by using neural networks. Adaptive filters such as the Kahnan filter, Hysteresis filter fl09], or fast least square algorithms [116] can be used for EOG segmentation. Discovering an c1..")Sociation between the two classes of patients; exposed and unexposed to 1nedication, is an irnportant step in bknnedical signal analysis of n1edication. Furthermore, why and how these two classes are related to sleep eye movernents should not be lirnited to this research, and they need independent research in the future.

Appendix A

Fo1-1.rier Analysis
The Fourier Transfonn (FT) is applied to linear tirne-inva.:riant signals. Sinusoidal waves,
eiwt

are eigenvectors of this linear time-invariant process. This process is specified by the
1\

eigenvalues h(w) in which a signal,/, can be decornposed to a su1u of sinusoidal eigenvectors

Equation A.l represents the Fourier transforn1 off (93].

Iff has finite energy, the theory of F'ourier integrals represents the derivation off fron1

by Equation A.2, which is known as Inverse Fourier Transforrn (IFT).

(A.2)

Since FT is known as a linear tirne invariant operator, it is used in stationary signal processing. However, in the case of non-stationary signal processing, the Fourier analysis rnay not be a good rnethod, since it cannot detect the transient phenornena in the signal, such as detection of a word pronounced at a particular tin1e in speech processing
[9~1].

Figure A.l represents the signal whieh eonsists of two sinusoidal wavefonns with frequencies of 20 Hz and 40 Hz. The second plot, in Figure A.l, represents the signal in the frequency-dornain, which is ca.lled FFT. Figure A.2 represents the signal that also consists of 20 and 40HZ sinusoidal waveforrns a.nd its FFT plot. Figure A.2 has 20 Hz and 40 Hz waveforn1s in reverse, with respect to

Figure A.l. As represented, Figure A.l is different from Figure A.2 in the time-domain, but their FFT is the same. This example clearly shows that the Fourier transform cannot represent the time aspect of the signal. Equation A.l derived the Fourier coefficient by
I\

correlating f with

eiwt,

f(w) strongly depends on the values of f(t) for all time, t , because

covers the whole real values~ [93]. In other words, the signal in the time-domain cannot

be recovered only from Fourier information in the frequency-domain.

Appendix B Gabor Function
The Gabor function is a Gaussian function n1odulated fron1 a sine and a cosine waveo The main application of Gabor wavelet is in feature detectiono Gabor filters, traditionally, were used in Short Fourier Transfonn analysis to locate the tirne and frequency information of
the signaL furthennore, Gabor filters have sorne advantages and
disadvantages~

The Gabor

function is the unique function for presenting the lower bound of the uncertainty principle, and it has a good directional selectivityo On the other hand, the 1naxirnun1 bandwidths are limited, and they are not optirnal to localize the tin1c infonnation for signals with broad spectral information [98]
0

The Gabor Function design with an arbitrary wide bandwidth is impossibleo The reason, in fact, is due to the small DC con1ponents that are in the even-symn1etric Gabor Function. Figure Bol represents a high bandwidth, even-synnnetric Gabor filter in the

frequency-donut.ino The transfer function is the sunnnation of two Gaussian functions located, syn1n1etrically, around the centre frequencyo The two Gaussian functions that n1ake the Gabor overlap at the origin if the standa1·d deviation of these Gaussian functions are larger than one third of centre frequency, and they will result an unwanted DC con1ponent

in the filter [08].
\Vhere the centre frequency is equal to three standard deviations, the bandwidth is about one octaveo In other words, the eutoff frequencies fall approxilnately on 2o- and 4cr (approxhnately fonn 005 to L5 on frequency axis of Figure Bol), which are equal to the one
