Abstract

Hisham Assi, "A New CEM43 Thermal Dose Model Based on Vogel- Tammann-Fulcher Behaviour in Thermal Damage Processes", MSc, Biomedical Physics , Ryerson University, Toronto, 2009

Thermal dose models are metrics that quantify thermal damage in tissues based on the temperature and the time of exposure. The validity and accuracy of one of the commonly used models (CEM 43 ) for high temperature thermal therapy applications (50- 90°C) is questionable. It was found to over-estimate the accumulation of thermal damage for high-temperature applications. A new CEM 43 dose model based on Arrhenius type VogelTammann-Fulcher equation using published data is introduced in this work. The new dose values for the same damage threshold that was produced at different in-vivo skin experiments were in the same order of magnitude, while the current dose values were 2 orders of magnitude different. The new dose values for same damage threshold in 6 lesions in ex-vivo liver experiments were more consistent than the current dose values. Computer simulations of laser interstitial thermal therapy showed that the current model usually predicts bigger volume than the new model does. The deviation in damaged volume prediction can be significant. The contribution of this work is introducing methods that can lead to more robust thermal dosimetry which will result in improved thermal therapy modelling, monitoring, and control.

Chapter 1 Introduction
1.1 Thermal Therapy

Quantifying the amount of thermal damage in biological systems based on thermal exposure (time and temperature of exposure) has been an active area of research for more than 60 years 2' 3 ' 5 ' 6 . Earlier, these studies focused mainly on skin burns 2 ' 3 ' 7 . The importance of heat-induced tissue damage studies has grown since heat started being used as a cancer treatment. Thermal therapy, which is a cancer treatment , can be divided into two types. In hyperthermia tissues are exposed to temperatures of 42°C to 46°C to kill cancer cells or to make them more sensitive to radiation therapy 8 or other treatment modalities. Coagulative thermal therapy, where higher temperatures (50°C to 90°C) are used , is a stand-alone thermal therapy which targets small localized solid tumours to destroy them by coagulation 9- 14 . Many sources of energy, including laser 9 ' 10 , microwave 11 , and ultrasound 12- 14 are being investigated for tissue heating. Each of them has its advantages and disadvantages. Some thermal therapies are non-invasive, like high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) while others are minimally invasive such as laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT). In LITT , laser energy is directly delivered to the tumour through one or more optical fibres inserted into the tissue. LITT is presented in detail in section 2.3 as a clinical application of thermal dose

methods.

1.2

Thermal Therapy Monitoring Techniques

The main challenge in thermal therapy is to destroy the tumour while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue and vital organs. Unlike the LITT ex-vivo experiment shown in figure 1.1 where the damage extent can be easily observed, knowing the damage extent and the damage boundary location for in-vivo treatments is a difficult task_. Hence , monitoring techniques are needed. Monitoring techniques that are being used and investigated include image-

based monitoring using magnetic resonance imaging ll ,l 2 ,15 ,16 , computed tomography 1 ,17 , and ultrasound imaging 18 , and point-based monitoring using temperature 9 ,19 ,20 and light based 21 point measurements. Real-time monitoring of the coagulation progression during treatment is vital in thermal therapy. It provides critical information to keep heating until the entire tumour is damaged , or to stop to prevent vital organ 's damage.

2

Image-based monitoring
Ultrasonography: Ultrasound imaging is usually used to guide accurate placement of catheters

into tumours. Real-time monitoring of thermal therapy using ultrasound has been investigated 18 , but the echogenic area that is observed during the treatment is believed to be caused by gas bubbles which does not represent the damaged area 1 . Ultrasound imaging is also problematic in evaluating damage after treatment since the echogenic area sometimes becomes heterogeneous in minutes 1 .
Computed tomography: CT can be used for the diagnostic assessment before treatment.

Within 4 days after the treatment, contrast-enhanced CT shows the non-perfused treated region very clearly as a well defined non-enhanced area in contrast with the untreated perfused area 1 . Real-time monitoring using CT has been investigated using dynamic contrast enhanced CT 17 , but data collection takes a long time making real time monitoring using CT impractical.
Magnetic resonance imaging: MRI can be used for diagnostics, guidance for catheter

placement and for evaluating damage extent after the treatment. In addition, MRI can be used in real-time monitoring of thermal therapy during treatment. Directly monitoring the progression of thermal damage by detecting structural changes during the treatment may underestimate thermal damage extent 11 ,15 . This may be due to the delay in damage manifestation in locations where exposure is less than that needed to cause immediate structural changes 11 . Therefore temperature maps produced during the treatment using MRI, can be used to predict damage. Some studies use the temperature, directly, as a threshold to defined damage 16 . Since temperature alone, regardless of exposure time, does not necessarily correlate with damage, time-temperature history should be used in quantifying thermal damage. This has been done in many studies 11 ,12 ,14 which showed a good match with histology and other after-treatment results.

3

Point-based monitoring
MRI is useful for real-time monitoring, but depending on it alone will limit the adoption of thermal therapy due to the cost , the size, and availability problems of MRI machines. Other real-time monitoring techniques, like point-monitoring, have been investigated for inexpensive real-time monitoring.

Temperature-based point monitoring is being used in real time monitoring of thermal
therapy. 9 ,19 ,20 Sensors are placed in critical locations like tumour boundary, close to vital organs, or at close to the power source to record temperatures during the treatment. The temperature history information at these points can guide decisions on whether to stop the treatment. It also can be used for dynamic feedback in thermal therapy control systems.

Optical-based point monitoring is also being investigated. Taking advantage of the significant changes in tissue optical scattering properties due to coagulation, temporal profile of light intensity at a single point can be used to obtain global information about the progression of thermal damage 21 . Many of the monitoring techniques give information about temperature history at a given location. What is more relevant is the amount of thermal damage at that location. Hence, a

reliable method to quantify the end point of thermal damage, based on the time-temperature
information, is needed. These methods depends on thermal dose models.

1.3

Thermal Dose

Thermal dose is not simply a measure of the amount of energy delivered. Rather, it is a measure of the amount of tissue damage caused by heat. An ideal thermal dose model should predict the same dose for the same damage (i.e. biological endpoint) regardless of the heating protocol used (i.e. the time-temperature combination). Thermal damage , or heat-induced cell death, is believed to be caused by protein denaturation , for the range of temperatures used in thermal therapy 22- 24 . The first thermal dose model , known as the

4

'

Arrhenius model (equation 2.2) , was introduced by Henriques in 194 7 3 based on rate process analysis. In this model , thermal damage is quantified by a single parameter (denoted by D) which depends on the time-temperature profile and two tissue-dependent parameters that are experimentally determined for each type of tissue. Henriques found the parameters based on in vivo experiments for both porcine and human skin 2 . In those experiments, timetemperature combinations to achieve the same thermal damage end point (7 days later) were obtained. Damage can continue to occur after the completion of the treatment. The fact that dose models have been developed using the final damage as an end-point is very important , because this will lead to predicting the final damage when these models are used. The Arrhenius parameters reported for certain tissue type in different studies are significantly different 25 , which raises a problem with using the Arrhenius dose model. This thesis provides an alternative modified Arrhenius equation for thermal damage analysis which might solve this problem. Another commonly used thermal dose model is the CEM 43 model (equation 2.4) which was originally introduced by Sapareto and Dewey in 1984 5 . This is an empirical model that quantifies damage by the exposure time at some reference temperature. 43°C was arbitrary chosen as the reference , where all thermal exposures are converted to "equivalent minutes" [eq.min] at this temperature. The time-temperature relationship on which this conversion is based was suggested by many experimental observations of different biological systems 2 ·8 ·26 . In most biological systems, a 1o c increase in temperature requires half the time for the same effect above 43°C and one-fourth of the time below 43°C. For example, if a certain thermal damage threshold can be achieved by heating at constant temperature of 43°C for 200 minutes, the CEM 43 model would predict that the same threshold could be also achieved by heating at other time-temperature combinations such as those shown in figure 1.2 where the dose for each combination is: t43 = 200 [eq.min]. This relationship does not assume, nor does it require, that different tissues have the same thermal sensitivity. Hence , the CEM 43 model can be used for different tissue types

without the need to derive specific damage parameter for each one of them. This simplicity, has led to its wide adoption for dose calculations in thermal therapy applications 9 ,10 ,12- 14 . The current CEM 43 model was originally developed for traditional hyperthermia applications (temperatures less than 47°C). The validity and accuracy of this model for high temperature applications (50- 90°C) is questionable. This is demonstrated using in-vivo time-temperature data from Moritz and Henriques 2 ' 3 . Each time-temperature combination yielded the same tissue damage, yet the doses using the current CEM 43 model are different, most notably above 55°C where the dose increases rapidly with temperature as shown in figure 1.3. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the current CEM43 dose model over-estimates the accumulation of thermal damage for high-temperature thermal therapy applications, and a more accurate thermal dose model can be introduced based on experimental results and the rate process analysis. A new CEM 43 dose model is introduced in the next chapter. The new

model uses the same concept of equivalent minutes at 43°C. Though, the time-temperature relationship upon which the new dose calculation is based was derived by fitting experimental results of different biological systems over a wide range of temperatures (up to 70°C) , as opposed to the "rule of thumb" approximation that is used in the current CEM 43 model.

Chapter 2 Theory
Thermal Dose Models

2.1

Two thermal dose models are being used to quantify thermal damage; the Arrhenius model and the CEM 43 model. These two models were introduced in the Chapter 1. In this section, the theory and the formulae for these models are presented. In Addition , a third dose model using Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher equation (VTF) to describe thermal damage processes, is introduced here.

2.1.1

Arrhenius model

Thermal damage has been modelled as a first-order rate process in which tissue constituents transform from native state to damaged state with a reaction velocity (or rate constant) , k [s- 1 ] 3 ,22 . The dependence of k on temperature, as in many other reactions , can be described by the Arrhenius equation:
k

=

A e- ( R (T + 273)

Ea

)

(2.1)

where A is a frequency factor [s- 1 ], Ea is the activation energy [J mole- 1 ], R the universal gas constant [8.23 J mole- 1 K- 1 ], and T is the Temperature [°C]. Based on a first-order rate process assumption , accumulated thermal damage due to heating can be quantified by a 8

dimensionless parameter 0:

where T [s] is the total heating time. The integral above is the Arrhenius thermal dose model ' which was first introduced by Henriques in 1947 3 . In order to use this model for a certain tissue type, one needs to experimentally find the coefficients A and Ea for that tissue. This can be done using results from a series of heating experiments that produce the same amount of thermal damage (which is defined to correspond to at a constant temperature, T, for a time duration, simplified to a linear relationship:

For this case, equation 2.2 can be

(2.3)

versus ln(~) , known as an Arrhenius plot, should be a straight line (since

Ea is constant parameter). The activation energy, Ea , can be found from the slope of the
plot, while A can be found from its y-intercept.

2.1.2

CEM43 model

Sapareto and Dewey introduced a thermal dose model that uses the exposure time at 43°C to quantify thermal damage 5 . The model is usually called CEM 43 (Cumulative Equivalent Minutes at 43°C). The dose in CEM 43 is represented symbolically using t43
.

Exposure at

different temperatures is converted to t43 , which has the units of equivalent minutes at 43°C, using a simple time-temperature relationship. The accumulative dose value, in [eq.min], can be mathematically describe as:

2.1.3

VTF model

For many temperature dependent reactions , a modified Arrhenius equations are used when the basic Arrhenius equation (2.1) does not describe the experimental data well. A modified Arrhenius-type asymptotic exponential equation, known as Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher equation (VTF) has been successfully applied to various rate processes 27- 29 . In the VTF equation, the reaction velocity k has the following form 28 ,29 :
. { A e-( T~To)

k=

T >To T::; To

(2.5)

where A [s- 1 ] is a frequency factor , a [K] is a parameter related to a dependent activation energy 29 , T0 [°C] is the absolute temperature where the dynamics of the given system can no longer be thermally activated 27 ,28 , and T [°C] is the system temperature. T0 is a systembased temperature that replaces the absolute zero (-273°C) in the basic Arrhenius equation. Hence, one can think of VTF equation as the general case of the basic Arrhenius equation. Using this modified Arrhenius equation, the thermal dose model in equation 2.2 becomes:

!l(r) =A

By using the same assumptions and procedure to generate equation 2.3, one can generate a VTF analogue dependent on two parameters a, and A:

(2.7)

By plotting (T~To) versus ln( ~) one can find a and A from the plots using the slope and the y-intercept, respectively.

2.2

New CEM43 Model

Because of the simplicity and the universality of the CEM 43 dose calculations, the goal of this work is to introduce a new more robust CEM 43 dose model that improves the current one by making it applicable to a wider range of temperature. The new model uses the same units of equivalent minutes at 43°C to quantify thermal damage. This was done by linking the CEM 43 to the Arrhenius model and fitting experimental data base on both Arrhenius and VTF equations. The universality of the CEM 43 dose model does not mean that all biological systems have the same time-temperature relation to achieve an isothermal effect. Rather, it assumes that they have parallel time-temperature relations. The current CEM 43 model assumes that timetemperature relations to achieve an isothermal effect in all biological systems have a break at 43°C. This assumption of parallel relations means that the normalized time (relative to the time at some reference temperature, 43°C in this case) for all biological systems has the same relation with temperature to achieve an isothermal effect. That is, for the current CEM 43 model if one heats tissue at constant temperature, T, for a period of time,
T,

to
,

achieve some thermal effect, then the amount of time one needs when heating at 43°C, t43 to achieve the same effect is:

(2.8)
The natural logarithm of the normalized time ( t43 / T) then has a linear dependence on temperature:

Verification that normalized time (to time at 43°C) has the same relation with ternperature to achieve isothermal effect in different biological systems was investigated using published experiment results (figure 2.1) . The goal, therefore, was to find a function B(T)

Four published data sets from four different experiments were considered. Each of them provides the exposure time, isothermal effect.

Three of the experiments were done in vitro by different groups and

reported by Henle and Dethlefsen 26 . The fourth was done in vivo by Moritz and Henriques. The threshold, or the isothermal effect, in the fourth experiment was irreversible epidermal injury 2 ' 3 . Since this experiment starts at 44°C, the time at 43°C was extrapolated from the other data points. The other three sets have 43°C as one of the temperatures. The
normalized exposure time ( t43 / T) for each experiment was plotted against temperature , all

in one semi-log plot shown in figure 2.1. The relation between the normalized time ( t43 /r) and the heating temperature, T , to achieve an isothermal effect was derived based on both Arrhenius and VTF equations to find a general form for B(T) in equation 2.10. Based on the Arrhenius model, for constant temperature of 43°C equation 2.3 becomes:

This equation can be rewritten as:

The fit is represented by the red solid line in figure 2.1.

The information in figure 2.1 supports the universality of equivalent-minute calculations by showing that data from different experiments in different biological systems can be fit using a single function. Secondly, it shows that relationship used in the current CEM 43 dose model (the dashed line) fits the data reasonably well for temperatures less than 52°C, but it diverges increasingly for higher temperatures. Hence, the current CEM 43 model overestimates dose accumulation at higher temperatures. Third, it shows that VTF based relation fits the data much better than the basic Arrhenius based relation. Therefore, the VTF based form (equation 2.14) was chosen for the function B(T) in equation 2.10. Allowing p = 43 ~To and q = To , then B(T) is:

B(T) = p(T - 43). (T- q)

(2.15)

The data in figure 2.1 was fit to equation 2.15 resulting in p = 19.6 (16.5, 22.7) and q = 23.5°C (18.5°C, 28.5°C) , where the values on the parentheses represents the 95% confidence bounds, and the goodness of fit was R 2 = 0.99. Substituting equation 2.15 into equation 2.10 produces a new CEM 43 dose model:

The next chapter presents results from testing the ability of this new model in predicting thermal damage compared to the current CEM 43 model. The investigations were done using both constant-temperature and time varying temperature experiments. The applicability of VTF model, with T0 = q =23.5°C compared to the basic Arrhenius model in thermal damage applications is also shown in the next chapter. The results of LITT simulations are shown as well to investigate the deviation between t43 and t~ 3 in predicting damaged volume. Before this, the theory of LITT modelling is described in the following section.

2.3

Theory of LITT Modelling

Simulations are a common method for studying and better understanding thermal therapy process. Thermal dose models are needed in thermal therapy simulations to predict damage volumes or damage boundaries. Some studies predict thermal damage from spatial temperature-histories obtained using instruments like MRJ1 2 ,14 . Other studies, simulate the whole process, from energy propagation in tissue to heat generation and transfer, to predicting thermal damage 9 ,10 ,30 . Tissue properties related to energy propagation and heat transfer might change as a function of thermal damage. Hence , thermal dose is not only important for damage boundary prediction, it is also needed to model dynamic changes in tissue due to heating. What is relevant in modelling thermal damage are damage volumes and damage boundaries in order to make sure that the tumour region is damaged while the surrounding healthy vital organs are being spared. Since dose values calculated over a heated region have a very high spatial gradient, the damaged volume will not change much even if very different threshold dose values are used. Therefore, the predicted volume of damage using t43 versus
t~ 3 might be similar. A theoretical model for laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) in

prostate was built to investigate this. LITT is a minimally invasive technique for destroying localized solid tumours. Laser energy is applied directly to the tumour region via one or more flexible optical fibres inserted into the tissue. The objective of LITT is to achieve irreversible thermal damage in a targeted tumour region over a period of a few minutes while saving the surrounding healthy tissues and vital organs. A finite-element LITT simulation was developed using the COMSOL Multi physics© ( COMSOL AB, Stockholm). LITT is a complex process that involves many physical variables that change non-linearly during the treatment as shown in figure 2.2. The modelling of this process can be broken up into optical diffusion, heat transfer and thermal damage. Each of these is described below.

2.3.1

Model geometry

A 2-D axisymmetric geometry was used, with rotational symmetry around the axes of the fibre, in which laser energy diffuses only through the sides of a 2 em diffuser ( boundary

#

1 in figure 2.3). The boundaries of the computational domain were far enough from the

centre of the source (5 em) such that no changes occur at them. The mesh in figure 2.3 has 44,502 elements. The number of degrees of freedom for the coupled problem was 244,035. A 10 minutes LITT treatment, simulated using COMSOL Multi physics© , takes 18.4 minutes to solve and uses 8GB of RAM.

2.3.2

Optical diffusion

Because of the high scattering nature of tissue, the diffusion approximation of radiative transport equation can be used to model light distribution in tissue 31 ,32 :

t 43 _critical [eq.min] is the thermal dose threshold corresponding to the onset of the damage.

11~_denatured is higher than 11~_native, but different relations between these two values have been

reported. 4 ' 33 ,34 . 11~_denatured = 411~_native was used in these simulations based on a paper by Skinner et al 4 . The absorption coefficient, l1a , can be modelled with an equation similar to equation 2.18, although it was assumed a constant since studies show that it changes slightly with coagulation above or below the native value depending on tissue type and wavelength 4 ,33 ,34 . For the boundaries, a Neumann condition, - n · D c \l cp = 2 1r~o L , was used at boundary

2.3.3

Bioheat transfer

Heat is generated in the tissue region due to absorption of light and then propagates through the tissue. This can be described using the Pennes bioheat equation 35 ,

(2.19)

where T is tissue temperature [°C], t is time [s],

Pt , Ct,

are density [kg m- 3 ], specific

heat [J kg- 1 K- 1 ], and thermal conductivity [W m- 1 K- 1] of tissue respectively. While, wb [kg m- 3 s- 1 ], cb [J kg- 1 K- 1 ], and Tb are the blood perfusion rate, blood specific heat , and blood temperature (37°C) , respectively. Q is the heat source [W m- 3 ] which is related to the 18

absorbed optical energy everywhere in the tissue 9 ,20 . Equations 2.17 and 2.19 are coupled by the following equation:

Q(r) = J-La ¢(r).

(2.20)

The tissue properties in equation 2.19 exhibit heat-induced changes during the treatment. The thermal properties,
Pt Ct ,

and kt change slightly with heating. They can reasonably be

assumed to have the same dynamic changes as water (which makes up 83% for prostate) thermal properties in the range of 20- 100°C 20 ,36 . The blood perfusion rate changes significantly during the treatment. It increases as a function of temperature and decreases to reach zero as a function of thermal damage 30 ,37 ,38. It can be described by the following equation 38 :

f(T) = { : + 0.6(T- 37°C)

(2.21)

where

WbQ

is the baseline blood perfusion before heating begins.

The Neumann boundary condition ( -n · kt \JT = 0) was used for all boundaries (1-8) in the thermal model.

2.3.4

Thermal damage

Simulations were done using both the current and the new CEM 43 models. Equation 2.4 was reformulated into a differential form so that it could be solved using the finite-element based software COMSOL Multiphysics©: dt43 = C(43-T(r,t)) dt The same thing was done for the new CEM 43 model from equation 2.16:

CEM43 models Results
Epidermal injury

In their work titled "Studies of thermal injury" in 1947, Moritz and Henriques tried to find information about the rate at which skin burning occurred at any given surface temperature. They gained time-temperature thresholds resulting in different levels of skin injuries. They did their experiments in vivo for both porcine and human skin. Experiments were done at constant temperatures. The skin surface was immediately brought and maintained at a predetermined constant temperature using an applicator by which a running stream of temperature-controlled water was brought in direct contact with the skin 2 . In introducing the Arrhenius based dose calculations, Henriques used two of the epidermal injury thresholds: "threshold A" and "threshold B" 3 . Threshold A was used to produce one of the data sets used in figure 2.1. This threshold represents the minimum exposure time resulting in complete transepidermal necrosis. Threshold B represents the maximum exposure time resulting in reversible epidermal injury. This threshold was used to produce the data used in figure 1.3 to show the inconsistency in the current CEM 43 dose model. Since the time-temperature combinations in threshold B results in an isothermal effect , an ideal thermal dose model

21

should predict the same dose value for each combination.

Figure 3.1 repeats the results previously shown in figure 1.3 and adds t~ 3 dose values on the left side of the data-points. The t~ 3 dose values are in the same order of magnitude and are more consistent than the t 43 dose values which has 2 orders of magnitude difference for high temperatures. This gives an indication that the new CEM 43 model is more consistent in predicting thermal damage than the current CEM 43 model.

3.1.2

Thermal damage in cartilage

Studying cell viability and finding survival fraction after heat exposure is a common experiment in thermal dosimetry studies. Survival information, which shows survival fraction versus exposure time for different constant temperatures were used for quantifying thermal 22

damage 5 ·24 ·26 ·39 ·40 . Thermal damage increases as survival fraction decreases. An ideal thermal dose model should predict a unique dose value for a distinct survival fraction. The new dose model was tested using detailed survival information from a study using a relatively high range of temperatures (48°C-62°C) 40 . The study characterized cellular damage due to heating in rabbit nasal cartilage by quantifying the concentration of healthy cells (the surviving fraction) in tissue samples versus exposure time at constant temperature water baths (48- 62°C). For each time-temperature combination, the dose value in equivalent-minutes was calculated using both the current CEM43 model and our new CEM 43 model. Since the surviving fraction for each of these combinations is given; the dose survival response for both models were plotted as shown in figure 3.2. Looking at figure 3.2, two things are noticed. The t43 dose values (in parts a and b) are very high in comparison to the t~ 3 dose values (in parts c and d) , although both of them are based on the same time-temperature information. More importantly, the survivalt~3 response is closer to the ideal survival-dose relation, where a distinct survival fraction is

mapped to a unique dose value, than the survival-t43 response where the survival lines do not join each other, and the same surviving fraction corresponds to a wide range of t43 values. This shows that the new CEM 43 model is more consistent in predicting thermal damage than the current one. The new model is closer to an ideal thermal dose model than the current one.

3.1.3

Laser-induced heating

All the data used in deriving the dose model and the testing thus far were from controlled experiments where heating takes place at constant temperatures. Thermal dose models are needed for clinical applications like cancer where temperatures vary throughout the tissue and change with time. Hence, we need to look at dose prediction results in real transient heating experiments similar to those in thermal coagulation treatments. Data from ex-vivo liver heating experiments obtained from UPEI were used for this purpose 41 . 23

In each of these experiments, six thermal lesions were created on the surface of an adult bovine liver sample using laser energy. A multimode optical fibre with a 1 mm core diameter and 0.37 numerical aperture (ThorLabs, Newton, NJ, USA) , coupled to a Diomed 60, 810 nm diode laser (Diomed, Cambridge, UK) was placed 13 mm away from the tissue surface.

24

Constant laser power of 1.3- 1.6W for 1- 6 minutes exposure time was used to produce the lesions. Each lesion has a 1 minute longer exposure time than the previous one. This caused different lesion sizes and different temperature histories . Surface temperature history for each lesion was collected using a thermal camera (FLIR ThermaCAM SC2000, FLIR Systems, Burlington, On, Canada) with a 34/80 close-up lens at a rate of one frame per second. The sample was originally frozen , and was brought quickly to room temperature before the start of the experiment. The tissue was allowed to cool to room temperature after the creation of each lesion. The thermal camera continued to collect data two minutes after the laser was turned off. After the lesions were created, an optical image of the sample was acquired and is shown in figure 3.3a.

(b)

Figure 3.3: Six lesions generated in bovine liver using laser with different heating time in (a). The degree of tissue whitening is related to the severity of thermal damage, hence, the borders of the lesions in the binary image in (b) correspond to the same amount of damage

Calculated t43 and t~ 3 doses were generated using the temperature data from the thermal camera and compared against the level of thermal damage. A 2 minute cool down period was included in the calculations since damage keeps accumulating after heating has stopped. Temperatures at the end of this period were observed to be too low to significantly accumulate more dose. The dose values in equivalent-minutes were calculated using both the current and the new CEM 43 models. Although t 43 values are clearly higher than the

< values, neither

this fact nor the values themselves can tell information about the validity or the superiority of any of the two models. They were each compared against a measure of thermal damage to test their predictions. Since thermal damage in liver tissue is correlated with change in tissues optical properties or tissue whitening 4 , an arbitrary brightness threshold (in the whitening range of lesions boundaries) was chosen for the image in figure 3.3a. This was done by converting the coloured image to a binary (black and white) image, and then choosing a certain image intensity (which corresponds to choosing a certain damage threshold) to create 6 white areas in the black background as shown in figure 3.3b. Then, the areas enclosed inside this threshold boundaries, were calculated. In this way, the surface areas of 6 lesions, all of them bounded by the same thermal damage contour, were obtained. For each lesion, the calculated dose values (using the data obtained by the thermal camera) were used to find the dose threshold that would enclose the same area obtained for that lesion with the white light image processing as shown in figure 3.4 . Ideally the dose thresholds for all lesions should be the same. Figure 3.5 shows these threshold values for the six lesions using both t43 and t~ 3 dose results. Using the current CEM 43 model, dose threshold values for the 6 lesions, shown in figure 3.5a, have an average, J.L = 3.4 x 106 eq.min, a standard deviation, a = 3.3 x 10 6 eq.min, and a coefficient of variation Cv = ~ = 0.99. While using the new CEM 43 model, the thresholds (figure 3.5b) have an
J.L average, J.L

= 3.0 x 104 eq.min, a standard deviation

eq.min, and a coefficient of variation Cv = ~ = 0.37. Similar results were obtained when the same procedure was repeated for a second liver sample. For the second sample, the coefficient of variation using the current CEM 43 ( Cv = 0.86) was again higher than the one using the new CEM 43 ( Cv = 0.40). These results demonstrate the consistency of the new CEM 43 dose model in predicting thermal damage in comparison with the current CEM 43 dose model.

Arrhenius and VTF Results

The Arrhenius plots(review section 2.1.1 for a description of Arrhenius plots) for the two damage thresholds A & B (described in section 3.1.1) from Moritz and Henriques 2 ' 3 , and of three other experiments reported in Henle et al 26 are shown in figure 3.6. Figure 3.6a is the Arrhenius plots of ln(1/T) versus 1/(T + 273). According to equation 2.3, the plots should fit straight lines where the parameters Ea and A can be found for each type of tissue from its plot. Similarly, figure 3.6b shows a modified Arrhenius plots, using the VTF form , of ln(1/T) versus 1/(T- 23.5). Based on equation 2.7, the plots should fit straight lines where

the parameters a and A for each tissue type can be found from the slope and the y- intercept of the corresponding plot. Figure 3.6a shows that the Arrhenius plots for thermal damage do not exhibit a linear dependence. Rather, they form curves. This is more obvious when the data covers a wide range of temperatures. Constant values for the parameters Ea and A , assuming a linear Arrhenius plot, will produce a poor fit to the data. Hence , the basic Arrhenius model does not describe the kinetics of the thermal damage process very well. On the other hand, figure 3.6b shows that modified Arrhenius plots (using VTF model with T0 = 23.5°C) are very close to straight lines. Constant values for the parameters a and A will produce a better fit to the data. Hence, the VTF equation appears to better describe the kinetics of the thermal damage process compare to the Arrhenius equation. Henriques derived Arrhenius parameters (for thermal damage process in skin) by assigning n = 1 for threshold A in the epidermal injury data 3 . He found that

Results of LITT Simulations

The main purpose of the simulations was to investigate the deviation between the two CEM 43 dose models in predicting volumes of damage for different treatment scenarios. Three parameters were considered in simulations. First, heating protocols, or power-time combinations used to achieve a prescribed volume of damage. 15 simulations with input laser power from 1- 15 W with 1W increment for each simulation were performed. The 15 simulations were repeated using the new CEM 43 dose model. Second, the damage threshold was varied. The dose threshold , in equivalent minutes, for the onset of thermal damage was reported for different type of tissue 42 . The value of 240 eq.min has been used in many studies 12- 14 ,20 . There is s significant uncertainty in this number, hence, some studies considered a margin of 4 to 20 times this value in their investigations 12 ,13 . Two different threshold values, 240 eq.min and 5,000 eq.min, were considered and the results are shown in figure 3.8. The third parameter examined was the target volume. The deviation in damage prediction was investigated using two prescribed target volumes , 0.5 cm3 and 1 cm3 . For each simulation, the time to reach the prescribed damage volume using a certain dose threshold was found based on
t 43 dose calculations. Then, the damage volume at that time if the same simulation was run

using t~ 3 dose calculations was found. The two damage volume values are represented by the bars in figure 3.8. The temperature at that time at the damage boundary are represented by the circular markers in figure 3. 8.

Discussion
Thermal dose models are empirically derived formulae to be used in clinical applications. The models quantify thermal damage by finding relationships between exposure time, temperature, and damage end point based on experiments. These relationships have been studied for many biological systems both in vivo and in vitro. The studies show that thermal darnage is exponentially dependent on temperature and linearly dependent on exposure time. The current CEM 43 thermal dose model, which uses the equivalent heating time at 43°C as a dose metric, assumes (based on experimental observations) that the slopes of the timetemperature relations to achieve an isothermal effect in all biological systems have a break at 43°C. The values of the slopes, above and below 43°C, are related to the two constant values of C in equation 2.4. While the value C should vary with ternperature 5 , the two values are a good approximation for traditional hyperthermia applications (temperatures less than 4 7°C). The validity of this approximation for high temperature applications (50- 90°C) is questionable. Hence , a new time-temperature relation, to be used in a new CEM 43 thermal dose model, is needed. The relation should have (in correspondence to a temperature-dependent

C value) a continuously changing slope. This is the case of
equation 2.15 , as shown in figure 2.1.

t~e

new relation described by

A modified Arrhenius equation, the VTF equation, offers a better fit to experimental

34

data (figure 2.1) and was therefore used to develop the new CEM 43 model. The VTF can be considered as a general form of the basic Arrhenius equation, in which there is an absolute temperature , T0 , below which the reaction can no longer be thermally activated 27- 29 . This temperature is absolute zero (-273°C) in the basic Arrhenius case. The absolute temperature for thermal damage process in the examined experiments was close to room temperature

(To = q = 23.5 when fitting equation 2.15 to the experimental data). Whether this is a
coincidence is left as an open question. The applicability of the VTF model to thermal damage applications can be determined by examining the Arrhenius plots shown in figure 3.6. Constant values for VTF parameters

(a and A) lead to a good fit of the data in figure 3.6b. This is not the case for the Arrhenius
parameters (Ea and A) which produce a poor fit to the data in figure 3.6a since the data points in these plots form curves instead of straight lines. This explains the findings in some studies that the activation energy was temperature dependent when using the basic Arrhenius equation 6 ,24 ,25 ,43 . They are basically trying to approximate the curves by piecewise-linear relations , while a better solution is to use the modified Arrhenius, VTF, as shown in figure 3.6b.
It is important to note that using a universal CEM 43 model for all tissue types is an

approximation to using the VTF model for specific type of tissue. A universal CEM 43 model assumes that all tissue types exhibit the same slope in the modified Arrhenius plots. Using
p

=

_a _ 43 23 5

= 19.6 in equation 2.15 , corresponds to assuming one value for the VTF param-

eter, a, (a= 382K) in all tissue types. This is still a good approximation since the values of the VTF parameter, a , for the different tissues in figure 3.6b ranges between 371 K and 415 K. This is also obvious in figure 2.1 where data from different biological system were fitted (with an R 2 value of 0.99) in order to derive the new CEM 43 dose model. If a more precise model is desired, then one can find the VTF parameters (a and A) for a specific type of tissue, and use equation 2.6 as a thermal dose model. Thermal dose models use relative metrics , the dimensionless

n in the Arrhenius models,

35

and t43 or t~ 3 [eq.min] in the CEM 43 models (that theoretically range from zero to infinity) that should be positively correlated to the amount of thermal damage. These dose models are different in the way they quantify thermal damage. Using CEM 43 models , the dose value can be found independent of the tissue type, and then specific dose threshold for specific tissue types can be used. In Arrhenius models , the Arrhenius parameters are tissue specific and are determined using a reference dose threshold of

n = 1.

Then , the calculated

n value

is mapped to damage extent relative to that threshold. While both metrics were used for producing the results in this work, the thesis concentrates on the CEM 43 models, since they are simpler and more commonly used. Chapter 3 presents experimental testing of the new CEM 43 dose model showing that it is an improvement to the existing model. Figure 3.1 shows the consistency of

< dose val3

ues for the same damage threshold resulting from different time-temperature combinations. Although the data is from the same experiments from which one of the data sets used in deriving the new CEM 43 dose model was obtained 2 ,3 , the two data sets represent two different damage thresholds. In addition, the same data that was used to derive a dose model can still be used to test its fundamental validity. Using the VTF model (with parameters derived from time-temperature data) to go from dose to time-temperature values as shown in figure 3. 7 demonstrates the validity of the VTF model by expecting the time-temperature relation to be close to the original data. This was not the case for the basic Arrhenius model. More support to the validity of

< is demonstrated in figure 3.2 which shows survival
3

fraction from thermal exposure against thermal dose values. The survival-dose response was more consistent using the new CEM 43 dose model compared to the current CEM 43 model. Since in thermal therapy treatments temperatures vary spatially and temporally, the new dose model was tested against laser-induced heating experiments which resembles thermal therapy treatments (figure 3.3). The consistency between the current and the new CEM 43 models in predicting damage thresholds was investigated. Although the method of specifying the thresholds using image processing has some uncertainty, this uncertainty has a

36

similar effect on both dose models. Using the same damage threshold to defined the boundaries of 6 lesions that were created by different heating protocols tests the consistency of the dose models considering different time-temperature histories. While using two different, arbitrary chosen, thresholds, gives an idea about the sensitivity of that consistency to the damage threshold. The results, as shown in section 3.1.3, support the hypothesis that the new CEM43 dose model is an enhancement to the current CEM 43 model. Since the ultimate goal of thermal dose modelling is to use it in clinical applications, it is important to investigate the clinical relevance of the proven consistency of

< in predicting
3

damage over a wide range of temperatures. Considering prostate cancer treatment using coagulative thermal therapy, the goal is to cause an irreversible thermal damage to the tumour region which has volume v by delivering thermal dose more than dose threshold (x eq.min) everywhere in tumour region. Meanwhile, a vital organ like the urethra should be spared by receiving thermal dose less than another threshold (y eq.min). Preliminary studies should be done to establish the thresholds x and y parameters in prostate thermal therapy.
If these studies where done using the current CEM 43 dose model with temperatures around

70°C, using these thresholds in a prostate treatment with temperatures around 55°C might cause the urethra to get damaged, because the preliminary studies over-estimated thresholds
y by using t43 . On the other hand, if the thresholds-establishing studies were done around

55°C, the actual treatment were done around 70°C, and the dose monitoring calculations showed the all volume v had received thermal dose greater than the threshold x, a volume less than v might only get damaged because of the usage of t 43 . This will leave part of the tumour untreated. The significance of the volume of untreated tumour was investigated using LITT simulations. Different scenarios, which involve different temporal and spatial distribution of temperatures during treatment, were considered by changing the laser power in the LITT simulations. Different prescribed coagulated volumes and different dose thresholds for the onset of coagulation were investigated as well. In the simulations many tissue parameters change based on

37

thermal dose values , which leads to a compounding effect by the dose in predicting damage volumes and damage boundaries. The simulations results are shown in figure 3.8.The three figures show that the difference between t43 an t~ 3 in predicting damaged volume increases as laser power increases. The second parameter was the dose threshold used to mark the onset of coagulation (threshold x). The deviation between the two models in predicting damaged volume reached 10.8% when the damage threshold was 240 eq.min as shown in figure 3.8a. This value is almost tripled when a threshold of 5,000 eq.min was used as shown in figure 3.8b. This is because higher treatments time are needed to achieve higher threshold at the boundaries for the same prescribed volume. This results in higher temperatures at the boundaries. In both of the previous cases, the prescribed volume of damage was 1 cm3 . In figure 3.8c, the effect of changing the targeted volume was investigated by using 0.5 em target volume. The deviation in this case reaches 45.9 %. Increasing the power, increasing the threshold, and decreasing the the prescribed volume, all corresponds to higher temperatures at the targeted volume boundaries. This is obvious by looking at the circular markers in figure 3.8 which represent the temperatures at the boundary for each simulations. Since

t43 increasingly over-estimates damage as temperature increases the deviation increase with
any of these changes as the results shows. The significance of the difference supports the importance of using the new CEM 43 dose model in thermal therapy dose calculations. Using the current model will lead to a damage volume less than the prescribed tumour volume, which will leave part of of the tumour untreated.

5.1

Summary and Conclusion

Quantifying thermal damage is very important for clinical applications of thermal therapy. The damage process in biological systems is complicated, and understanding it is not trivial. Thermal damage models assume a first order protein denaturation process in which tissue transforms from native state to denatured state. Protein denaturation is actually more complicated than two states process 23 . Other processes play roles in cell killing due to heat in different range of temperatures, sqme of them might be unexpected like the phase transformations that happen at threshold values. Neglecting all these complications, thermal dose models are empirical formulae that link exposure time, temperature, and damage extent to each other to form a dose-damage mapping system. Two things are needed to improve thermal dosimetry: more experimental results for a wider range of temperatures in different types of tissue, and new damage models that use experimental result more effectively to produce thermal dose models. This second point is the essence of this work. A new model for CEM 43 dose calculation has been introduced in this thesis. This dose model

39

shows more validity and consistency in predicting thermal damage than the existing one. Like the exiting CEM 43 model, the new model can be used for different types of tissue. The new CEM 43 model has its explanation in rate process analysis since it was derived based on a modified Arrhenius equation ( Vogal- Tammann- Fulcher type). VTF better describes the thermal damage process than the basic Arrhenius equation, as has been shown in this thesis. The general forms of new dose models were established in this study. Future experiments can result on more accurate values for the constants in equation 2.15 in order to be used in the new CEM 43 model. In-vivo , ex-vivo, and controlled cell-culture survival studies can be used for this purpose. While the in-vivo experiments resembles the actual treatment the most , the cell-culture experiments have an accurate damage quantifier by counting the survival fraction. The behaviour of the cells in cell-culture experiments might not mimic the behaviour of cells in-vivo because it does not include effects like vascular shut-down, or cell-cell signalling. This might be a drawback to cell-culture experiment. If more rigour is needed, one can use the VTF-based Arrhenius-type dose model for a certain type of tissue (equation 2.6) to quantify damage. Since VTF is new to thermal dosimetry studies, new parameters a and A are needed to be derived for different types of tissue. Furthermore, since the relation between the CEM 43 model and the Arrhenius-type VTF model is established in this work, if the parameter a for a certain type of tissue is determined, it can be used for CEM 43 calculations. The hypotheses in this thesis have been validated by showing that the current CEM 43 model overestimates dose values for higher temperature, and by introducing a more reliable CEM 43 model based on experimental results. In conclusion, the contribution of this work is introducing methods and mathematical models that will lead to more robust thermal dosimetry. This can lead to improvements in thermal therapy modelling, monitoring, and control.

Future Work
Thresholds studies

Establishing dose threshold and parameters for different type of tissue, based on the new thermal dose model, is needed. Since the new dose model is more consistent than the

current one, these thresholds and parameters will be more useful. The future work can include performing separate studies to find thresholds that represent the minimum dose (in eq.min) needed to cause irreversible damage to tumour tissues that are commonly targeted by heat treatments in tissue such as prostate, liver, and brain. In addition, thresholds that correspond to the maximum dose that tissues of some vital organs can receive without getting damaged, are needed. This will be very important for the clinical usage of thermal therapy.

5.2.2

Optical properties and dose

Dynamic changes in tissue properties due to damage accumulation need to be well described in order to be used in thermal therapy simulation. Dynamic changes in tissue scattering is an example of a property that changes significantly. Molding dynamic changes in tissue scattering is important for simulating treatments that uses optical energy like LITT. The change in scattering due to heat is clear in many examples; like the change of egg white from transparent (low scattering coefficient) to opaque (high scattering coefficient) after heat exposure. As shown in figure 3.3, thermal damage, which is related protein denaturation, is manifested as increases in scattering. Since the change in the scattering coefficient are correlated to thermal damage, it should have a unique relation with thermal dose. This is true , only if, the thermal dose model has an ideal dose-damage mapping system. The data shown in figure 5.1 from Skinneret al 4 was used to investigate that. The data shows the nominalized change in reduced scattering coefficient f-L~ as function of temperature and time from which thermal dose values can be calculated. The dose was calculated using both t43 and t~ 3
