-CONJUGATED HETEROLES CONTAINING GROUP 13 ELEMENTS Sossina Gezahegn Master of Science, Molecular Science, Ryerson University 2012 Abstract:

This research targeted the synthesis of group 13 neutral heteroles via transmetallation of the tin atom in stannole moieties. The synthesis of Heteroles of 15a (1-chloro-2,3,4,5tetraphenylborole), 15b (1-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetraphenylaluminole) and 15c (1-chloro-2,3,4,5tetraphenylgallole) were attempted. The potential formation of Lewis base adducts were explored through the addition of a coordinating solvent of THF, Et3N, and Et2O and characterized with NMR (1H,
13

C and

11

B where applicable). It was attempted to synthesize

Polymer 17a from the di-brominated borole monomer 16a via a Pd-catalyzed polycondensation reaction. THF was subsequently added to the polymer in an attempt to produce the polymer adduct 17a·THF. This was performed to produce a stable enough material for GPC analysis. The polymer was also characterized with NMR. Theoretical calculations were undertaken at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of DFT to help identify the effect of HOMO-LUMO energy gap of the above heteroles and their adducts. DFT calculations reveal that monomers and oligomer energy gaps can be tuned by substituents attached to the heterole, the type of Lewis adduct formed and the degree of catenation. These monomers and oligomers could potentially be novel building blocks for the synthesis of small energy gap -conjugated systems.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
This thesis has two main focuses:   To develop a new synthetic route to conjugated Group 13 heteroles via replacement of the tin atom in a stannole moiety. To explore the effects of Lewis-base adduct formation on the electronic properties of monomers and polymers containing group 13 heteroles using molecular modelling.

1.1 -Conjugated Systems
Conjugation can occur in any molecule with three or more adjacent atoms with overlapping p-orbitals.1 Lewis representations of conjugated systems possess alternating single (indicating sigma bonding only) and multiple bonds (where -bonding is present). In heavier atoms, d-orbitals can also potentially be involved in conjugation. Delocalization of electrons occurs when -electrons mobilize across all the appropriately aligned p-orbitals from adjacent atoms. The -electrons are associated with a group of atoms rather than being localized in either a molecular orbital shared between only two atoms or in an atomic orbital (associated with a single atom). This phenomenon increases stability by it lowering the ground state energy of the molecule.2 Due to their unusual optoelectronic properties, a variety of -conjugated materials

have found applications in multidisciplinary fields such as medicinal chemistry, 3 material science4 and crop protection science.3 The optical and electronic properties (such as electrical conductivity and nonlinear optics) of -conjugated materials are

influenced by the strength of conjugation.2,5 -Conjugated polymers and monomers can be employed as photovoltaic cells,5 light emitting diodes,4,5 and polymeric sensors.6 1

The foundation for -conjugated systems applications was born out of the discovery of metallic conductivity in a carbon-based polymer achieved through the doping of polyacetylene. Jointly, Alan G. Macdiarmid, Hideki Shirakawa and Alan J. Heeger observed a billion fold increase in electrical conductivity of a trans-syn-polyacetylene 1a (a linear organic -conjugated system) when it was oxidized with iodine vapor. 7 In this procedure, molecules of I2 stripped electrons from the polyacetylene, becoming I3(negatively charged anions) while making the polyacetylene positively charged (radical cations a.k.a. polarons). Polarons can then delocalize down the polyacetylene chain allowing for conductivity.7 Until this discovery, many organic polymers with all carbon backbones were categorized as insulators. This seminal work was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2000.8

Figure 1.1 Organic -conjugated polymers where E = O, S, NR8

After the discovery of the conductivity of doped polyacetylene, studies focused on the incorporation of heteroatoms into -conjugated systems with the intention of producing new linear-conjugated frameworks with enhanced conductivity and processibility.8 For example, compound 1b can be simply regarded as modified trans-syn-polyacetylene where a heteroatom E has been incorporated as a bridging atom (Figure 1.1).8 The nature of E

2

directly dictates the electrical and optical properties of materials of the form 1b and allows fine-tuning of the compound energy level difference.8 The advantages of these types of polymers (1b) over the strictly carbon-containing 1a include the potential for substituent alteration via electrophilic substitution reactions at the heteroatom center and the potential for increased stability due to its aromatic character. In order to identify the aromaticity in cyclic molecules, it is useful to consider Huckel's rule. The rule states that the number of -electrons in aromatic molecules (cyclic planar) must satisfy the formula 4n + 2, (where n is zero or positive integer). Thus aromatic compounds have two, or six, or ten, etc -electrons. In contrast, cyclic planar molecules that satisfy formula of 4n -electrons of four, eight, twelve, etc. and are described as antiaromatic.9 The energy in the -electrons of anti-aromatic compounds are higher than that found with aromatic compounds.10 A lone pair of electrons from the heteroatom in pyrrole (E = NR), furan (E = O) and thiophene (E = S) reside in the p-orbital interacting in the system and thus creating an aromatic system, while the other lone pair (from O and S) in sp2 orbital is not part of delocalized system.

1.1.1 Energy Gap of -Conjugated Systems
The discrete molecular orbitals in any extended conjugated system can be divided into stabilized bonding orbitals and destabilized antibonding orbitals, resulting in two continuous bands (energy levels) called valence and conduction bands. The valence band is occupied with electrons while the conduction band remains empty. The energy difference between valence and conduction bands in conducting materials (including conductive

3

polymers) is analogous to the HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital)-LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbitals) gap of small molecules, generally referred to as the energy gap (Eg).8 The HOMO-LUMO gap is a very important parameter in defining the optical and electronic properties of materials. When a molecule absorbs energy, the electron gets promoted from an occupied molecular orbital to a vacant molecular orbital at a higher energy. The most probable electronic transition is from HOMO to LUMO, however other transitions can occur, including *, *, n*, n* and additional * transitions.8 The energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO decreases as conjugation is extended due to relative energies of the increasing number of conjugated orbitals (Figure 1.2). Experimentally, the energy gap can be determined using a UV-VIS spectrometer by identifying the lowest energy absorption edge (onset) in the spectrum of the material.8

The conjugated molecular orbitals of linear polyenes, {CH}n, such as polyacetylene 1a, are delocalized throughout the structure and theoretically, the HOMO-LUMO gap of this molecule could approach zero. However, studies on the effective conjugation length show that there is an upper limit (saturation of monomer units at which conjugation occurs) for the addition of double bonds to linear polymers where no additional effect is observed.8

Figure 1.3 The energy gap comparison of an insulator, semiconductor and conductor.

The conductivity of a -conjugated system is directly dependent on the energy gap; the smaller the energy gap, the greater the conductivity (Figure 1.3).8 Insulators, such as diamond have an energy gap of 5.5 eV, while a semiconductor material such as silicon has 1.1 eV11 while the energy gap of any metal will be  0 eV due to the overlap of the conduction and the valence bands. Conjugation needs to extend over the length of the entire molecule in order to obtain the narrowest possible energy gap. Many studies have been carried out to identify suitable conjugated systems (possessing a small energy gap) that could act as alternatives to metals.8,12 For example, Roncali has reported on the considerations that affect the value of the HOMO-LUMO gap for linear -conjugated systems that incorporate aromatic moieties, such as polythiophene (Figure 1.4).12 The energy gap (Eg) of these linear conjugated systems can be influenced by the sum of five structural contributors: Eg = EBLA

6

+ ERes + Esub + E + EInt where BLA represents the bond length alteration; Res, resonance; Sub, the effect of substituent; , for dihedral angle; and Int, intermolecular interactions.12

Figure 1.4 Structural factors that affect the HOMO-LUMO gap of linear -conjugated systems.12 ERes confines the delocalization of -electrons within the aromatic ring while the E between the consecutive units limit the -electrons along the conjugated backbone. The Esub directly modulates the energy levels based on the electron withdrawing or donating substituents. When individual molecules or polymer chains are assembled into a material, the EInt can affect the magnitude of the molecules of the energy gap because each polymer chain experiences weak intermolecular interaction.12 Therefore, the five energy gap influencers of EBLA, ERes, ESub, E, and EInt are essential parameters to synthetic approaches for conjugated polymer synthesis.12

1.2 Stannoles and Other Group 14 Heteroles
There are several known routes to five-membered heterocycles that incorporate heavier group 14 elements such as tin. The first successful synthesis and isolation of a

7

stannole and its silole analogue was carried out by Braye and Hubel back in 1950's where 1,1,2,3,4,5-hexaphenyl-1H-metalloles were prepared through the reaction of 1,4dilithiotetraphenylbutadiene with Ph2MCl2 (M = Si, Sn, Ge, Pb)8,13 (Scheme 1.1, 3).

Scheme 1. 1 Synthesis of stannole and related ring systems.8

8

This route has been extended by Jutzi and Mitzel where 1-haloheteroles (Scheme 1.1, 4) are synthesized in a similar fashion from the dilithio precursor and trihalo-silanes and germanes.8 Reactions of GeCl4 or SiCl4 with 2 leads to a mixture of products including the low yielding spirocyclic compounds 5b, and the desired heterole 5a (Scheme 1.1). Fagan and Nugent have also reported on the conversion of zirconacyclopentadienes into stannoles.13

Previous studies suggest that the majority of these routes are applicable only to heavily substituted heteroles because less sterically encumbered species are more likely to undergo Diels Alder dimerization.8 In order to suppress this process, the incorporation of alkyl groups at the 3- and 4- positions of the metalloles is recommended. The nature of various substituents at 3- and 4-positions can also affect the characteristics of the metalloles besides the metal atom on the conjugated system.8

1.3 Boron and Boroles 1.3.1 Boron
Boron has three important features or properties that make it a good candidate for incorporation into -conjugated materials: (i) the formation of trivalent boron compounds with trigonal planar geometry, (ii) Lewis acidity resulting from empty p-orbital that can act as an electron acceptor site, and (iii) the ability to participate in extensive P-* conjugation due to its empty p-orbital.14

9

Figure 1.5 Boron: trigonal planar geometry (6), Lewis acidity and adduct formation (7) and P-* conjugation (8). (Nu = Nucleophile).14 Boron can participate in P- conjugation with its vacant p-orbital14 overlapping with the  molecular orbitals of a neighbouring carbon when incorporated in conjugated frameworks. The inclusion of boron in a conjugation results in unique absorption and emission spectra, a lower reduction potential that provides a suitable material for n-doping (doped by reduction) and good electron-transporting properties.15

1.3.2 Boroles
Boroles are anti-aromatic species which incorporate boron into a five membered ring that is isoelectronic to the cyclopentadienyl cation.16 Boroles are capable of accepting two electrons into the empty p-orbital of boron.17 For example, when complexed with bases such as amines, boroles become more stable due to the breakup the anti-aromatic system.

10

Figure 1.6 Pentaarylboroles and adducts.17 Synthetic routes to boroles are rather limited due to their highly reactive nature. The first monomeric borole 9a was isolated in 1961.17 This simple borole was stabilized with different Lewis-base ligands (9b) including NH3, PhCN, Py, Et2O, and THF to form stable adducts.

Further studies of boroles continued and in 1986, Eisch and coworkers synthesized 1-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetraphenylborole (via metal-tin metathesis reactions) using lithiated dienes by first forming stannole intermediates, 10, thus providing an important general route to a variety of boroles.18 This work was a modification of previous report by Eisch in 1969.18 Recently, Braunschweig16 and coworkers synthesized and isolated the free 1bromo-2,3,4,5-tetraphenylborole and its adduct form with THF using the methodology used by Eisch and coworkers.18

1.4 Aluminole, Gallole and Indacyclopentadiene
Aluminoles, galloles and indacyclopentadiene are borole analogs where the boron atom has formally been replaced by aluminum, gallium and indium, respectively. Only one aluminole, pentaphenylaluminacyclopentadiene, has ever been isolated.19 This compound was synthesized from the reaction of 1,4-dilithio-1,2,3,4-tetraphenylbutadiene with Cl2AlPh as an Et2O adduct and was analyzed by X-ray crystallography. In 2003, Xi and coworkers were able to synthesize chloro-aluminacyclopentadiene 12b from 1,4-dilithio1,3-dienes 12a and AlCl3. However, 12a was not isolated, but rather used as an

12

intermediate which was further reacted with aldehydes yielding a variety of substituted cyclopentadienes 12c.20

Scheme 1. 3 Synthesis of chloro-aluminacyclopentadiene from 1,4-dilithio-1,3dienes and AlCl3.20

Other classes of Group 13 heteroles that have received less attention than boroles are galloles and indacyclopentadiene. Fagan and Nugent have developed a general synthetic route that utilizes metallacycle transfer of a carbon fragment from zirconacyclopentadiene and were able to synthesize and isolate the gallole salt 13b (Scheme 1.4.).21

Scheme 1. 4 Metallacycle transfer from zirconium.21

13

Cowley and coworkers were able to synthesize organogalla- 14a and indacyclopentadienes 14b from the zirconium metallacycle 13a. In order to avoid selfdimerization of 14a and 14b, Cowley and coworkers attached a bulky supermesityl (2,4,6tri-tert-butylphenyl) substituent at the heterole atom which sterically protects the empty porbital of the heteroatoms (Scheme 1.5).20

The structure of 14a was verified using x-ray crystallography analysis which revealed two independent planar molecules packed within the symmetric unit.20

1.5 Molecular Modeling
Molecular modeling has become an important tool for synthetic chemists. It provides a pictorial interpretation of molecular orbital electron distributions and their electrostatic potentials.22 For example, potential energy surfaces can be analyzed using the coordination between energy and structure obtained from a modeling program. This could potentially unveil critical thermodynamic and kinetic information as well as molecular 14

equilibrium and transition state geometry.22 It is often possible to create visual presentations of a molecule's likely conformation even without crystallographic analysis, synthesis or isolation.

Creation of modeling software can be challenging due to the exactness of the Schrodinger equation (a mathematical equation resulting from the application of quantum mechanics to chemistry). The Schrodinger equation can only be solved for a one electron system such as hydrogen. As a result, the modeling of more complex molecular structures and resultant properties cannot be fully solved. Therefore, approximations are made to provide a more practical method. Severe approximations can, however, potentially lead to methods that do not provide accurate information. The more accurate a method is the more computationally expensive it will be.22 However, since there is no ideal method for all applications, a balance between cost and accuracy must be found. In 1950's, a Hartree-Fock approximation was applied to help solve a multiple electron systems model. After much trial and error, Hartree-Fock models (except for transition metals involved) were shown to provide useful kinds of thermochemical comparisons, yet poorly accounted for explicit bond making and breaking. Improvements to the Hartree-Fock model have now been estabilished using the Møller-Plesset, density functional and semi-empirical models. The Møller-Plesset model is an excellent model to analyze equilibrium geometries, conformations and the reaction thermochemistry for bond breaking and making. Density functional models and semi-empirical models do a nearly

15

similar task to Møller-Plesset model, except that the latter also includes transition-metals, however these are not satisfactory for conformational and thermochemical calculations.22

Models such as Hartree-Fock, Density Functional and Møller-Plesset use Gaussian type functions. Gaussian basis sets are used widely and documented thoroughly.22 The simplest atomic orbital representations are called a minimal basis set and contain functions that only require accommodation of the total electron count for the atom, at the same time maintaining its overall spherical symmetry. For example, hydrogen and helium have a single (1s) function while atoms from lithium to neon have five functions (1s, 2s, 2px, 2py, and 2pz).22 Table 1. 1 All-electron Gaussian basis sets in Spartan.22 Basis set 6-31G*, 6-31G** 6-31+G*, 6-31+G** 6-31++G*,6-31++G** 6-311G*,6-311G** 6-311+G*,6-311+G** 6-311++G*,6-311G** cc-pVDZ cc-pVTZ cc-pVQZ H-Ar, Ga-Kr H-Ar Available elements H-Kr

16

The basis sets shown in Table 1.1 can be supplemented with polarization to make them suitable for correlated models such as the Density Functional and Moller-Plesset models and give lower energy for representative molecule. For example, the simplest polarization basis sets are 6-31G* and 6-311G* which are constructed from the 6-31G and 6-311G basis sets respectively, by adding a set of d-type polarization functions. The basis sets that are designated by "+" as in 6-311+G** or 6-311++G** could be used to calculate anions to accommodate the extra electrons that may be loosely associated with atoms. Basis sets such as cc-pVDZ, cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ, (correlation consistent-polarized Valence Double, Triple Quadruple, and Zeta) respectively are formulated to calculate the lowest possible ground state atom energies. These basis sets do better in capturing the correlation energy for free atoms than basis set with "*".22 In general, it is important to compare both the models and basis sets for a given calculation since no method will be perfect for all applications.

1.6 Aim of This Work
This thesis targets the synthesis of -conjugated group 13 heteroles 15 (a =1chloro-2,3,4,5-tetraphenylborole, b = 1-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetraphenylaluminol, and c = 1chloro-2,3,4,5-tetraphenylgallole), monomer 16a and the attempted synthesis of polymer 17a via replacement of the tin atom in a stannole moiety. Compounds of 15 form an adduct through the vacant p-orbital of the metal center by accepting a lone pair from Lewis-bases of Et3N, THF and Et2O. As well, the synthesis of polymer 17a and its THF adduct will be investigated.

coworkers.23 Tilley's approach to monomer synthesis was a modification of Fagan and Nugent metallacycle transfer from zirconium to germanium.21

Theoretical studies were also performed for heteroles and oligometric heteroles using Spartan 10 software at the B3LYP/6-31 G* level in order to evaluate the general feasibility of a synthetic approach and alteration of the heteroatom. Influence of the heteroatom on the energy gap as well, the influence of Lewis-base adduct formation on the energy gap were analyzed. The energy gaps were evaluated with DFT on the basis of calculated HOMO and LUMO levels. DFT also was used to analyze the molecules electron density to see which orbital is responsible as reaction center.

Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of 1,4-Dilithio-1,2,3,4-tetraphenylbutadiene [2]

In a typical reaction, diphenylacetylene (5.0 g, 28.0 mmol) was dissolved in 37 mL of Et2O in 250-mL Schlenk flask. A lithium wire (0.2 g, 34.0 mmol) was added to the solution under argon gas. The lithium wire was washed with hexane to remove the mineral oil in which it was conserved. After 30 min of vigorous stirring, the colorless reaction mixture changed to scarlet color. At this point the unreacted lithium wire was picked out while stirring continued for 2 hrs. The mixture was added in situ for the preparation of 10 (see section 2.2).24

Upon addition, the scarlet color of dilithio mixture turned into transparent amber color. The solvent was removed in vacuo.24 The residue was washed (3 x 10 mL) with EtOH to remove residual tin halides and LiCl.

To 100-mL Schlenk flask, pure crystals of stannole 10 (1.0 g, 2.1 mmol) was dissolved in 25 mL of hexane. To this, (0.5 mL, 0.6 g, 5.1 mmol) of BCl3 (liquid in hexane) was added under N2 atmosphere at 0 oC and the mixture immediately changed to a dark red color. After 3 hrs, the reaction was stopped and the solvent removed in vacuo. The residue was further washed with cold hexane and again the solvent removed under reduced pressure. In a typical reaction, the entire product of 15a was dissolved in 3 mL of cold hexane (0

1 ml solution of 15a over 1 min in separate flasks. Immediate color changes were observed from dark red to yellowish (in the case of Et2O), or a clear solution with a small amount of white precipitate (upon addition of Et3N) then the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. In the 1H NMR spectra, the integrations for the number of protons of the ligands were not consistent with the structures.

CHAPTER 3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1. Synthesis of 1-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetraphenyl monomer precursors 3.1.1 Synthesis of 1,4-dilithio-1,2,3,4-tetraphenylbutadiene, [2]
1,4-Dilithio-1,2,3,4-tetraphenylbutadiene, 2, was synthesized via a modified approach based upon the work of Tracy and coworkers.24 In the literature route, reaction mixtures were allowed to stir for 4 hrs before removal of excess lithium and then subsequently stirred for further 2 hrs. However, it was noted these longer reaction times could result in the formation of 2,3,4-triphenyl-1-naphthyl lithium as a byproduct. In order to prevent this side reaction, overall reaction time was reduced.

A solution of diphenylacetylene in Et2O was added to a flask containing Li wire under argon (Scheme 3.1). Within 20-30 mins of stirring the clear transparent diphenylacetylene solution in Et2O turned to an opaque dark red colour upon reaction with Li wire, indicating the formation of the dilithio dimer 2.24

In the literature preparation of 2, the reaction mixture was allowed to stir for 4 hrs. In this research, after 2 hrs an aliquot of the reaction mixture was removed for 1H NMR (CDCl3) analysis, showing chemical shift data similar to literature values.24 At this point, the excess Li (m) was removed to prevent the potential formation of 2,3,4-triphenyl-1naphthyl lithium (a potential ring closure product observed after longer reaction times).24 The other modification to the literature preparation was that subsequent to the removal of the unreacted Li (m), no further stirring of the mixture (1-2 hrs) was undertaken. Compound 2 was not isolated (because exhibited to show decomposition upon isolation),25 and was used in situ for the proceeding step. 1H NMR (CDCl3) revealed resonance signals of 2 at H = 6.30-7.50 ppm as compared to diphenylacetylene (down shifted signals of diphenylacetylene due to triple bonds at H = 7.22-7.41 and 7.51 ppm respectively) phenyl regions. From the 13C NMR (CDCl3) analysis of 2, 10 peaks were observed in the aromatic region with chemical shifts at C = 125.61, 126.06, 126.13, 126.42, 126.84, 126.90, 127.50, 130.02, 131.23, and 131.50 ppm that are also consistent to the formation of 2 because there are two Ph environments. Even with the reduced reaction time, full consumption of the diphenyl acetylene starting materials was confirmed by the absence of acetylene carbon signals expected at C = 89.43 ppm.24

3.1.2 Synthesis of 1,1-dimethyl-2,3,4,5-tetraphenylstannacyclopentadiene, [10]
1,1-Dimethyl-2,3,4,5-tetraphenylstannacyclopentadiene 10 was prepared through the in situ reaction of 2 from the previous step, following the procedure outlined by Tracy.24 A solution of Me2SnCl2 in THF was added to a solution of 2 in THF at room

36

temperature in a 2:1 molar ratio (Scheme 3.2). The stoichiometric ratio must be carefully controlled because, as Tracy and coworkers noted24 an excess of the dilithium reagent 2 is known to cause the formation of the spirostannole bis-(1,2,3,4-tetraphenyl-1,3-butadiene1,4-ylidene). Similarly, an excess of Me2SnCl2 would result in the cleavage of the stannole ring from ethanolysis of Me2SnCl2 that generates HCl.28

Scheme 3. 2 1, 1-dimethyl-2,3,4,5-tetraphenylstannacyclopentadiene, 10.25

Upon addition of Me2SnCl2, the red dilithio solution changed color to orange-amber, indicative of the formation of a stannole. The solvent and excess starting material were removed in vacuo and the resulting
119

Sn NMR (CDCl3) analysis showed a singlet

resonance signal for 10 at Sn = 52.81 ppm which is significantly upfield from the Me2SnCl2 (Sn =  144). The observed 119Sn shift does not appear to be consistent with values previously reported by Zuckerman for 10 (Sn = -52.0 ppm).29 This difference could be simply a typographical error or the solvent, CH2Cl2 played a role to change the signal compared to the solvent the experimental sample ran in, CDCl3. In the 1H NMR (CDCl3), a singlet signal for the methyl proton at H = 0.73 (characteristic change versus starting material, 2) and broad multiplet signal at 6.94-7.29 ppm for the overlapping aromatic protons with the expected relative integration of 6 and 20 (3:10) respectively was observed. In the 13C NMR (CDCl3), 11 resonance signals at C = -7.72 37

(Sn-CH3), 125.03, 125.62, 127.23, 127.81, 128.26, 130.31, 140.81, 143.07, (C6H5), 144.96 (C-Sn), and 153.62 (C=C-Sn) ppm were obtained. 1H and 13C NMR results were in agreement with previously reported literature values and structure of 10. Compound 10 proved to be air-stable after recrystallization and was isolated as a yellow powder with an overall yield of 61% and 187oC melting point (both consistent with literature values).26 25

3.2. Attempted Synthesis of 1-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetraphenyl Heteroles
The synthesis of 15a (1-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetraphenylboracyclopentadiene), 15b (1chloro-2,3,4,5-tetraphenylaluminacyclopentadiene) and 15c (1-chloro-2,3,4,5-

tetraphenylgallacyclopentadiene) were all attempted through the addition of the corresponding MCl3 (M = B, Al, Ga) to 10 solution in a 1.5:1 ratio in hexane at 0 oC under N2 (Scheme 3.3). In all cases, an immediate colour change into dark red reaction mixtures was observed upon addition of MCl3. The reactions were left to stir for 3 hrs while slowly warming to room temperature. After the removal of the solvent and any excess volatile materials in vacuo, the remaining residue was washed with cold hexane. The hexanes was removed in vacuo prior to performing NMR (1H, applicable) analysis for all compounds (Table 3.1).

3.2.1 Analysis of 15a and Attempted Synthesis of Related Adducts

Scheme 3. 3 1-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetraphenyl heteroles, 15(a-c). For 15a, 11B NMR analysis showed a resonance signal at B = 26.15 ppm while 1H NMR analysis revealed overlapping multiplet resonance signals in the aromatic region (see Table 3.1) consistent with the formation of the target borole. Further analysis by 13C NMR revealed 10 resonance signals were observed at C = 120.42, 122.34, 123.82, 125.01, 126.50, 127.78, 130.66, 132.59, 134.83, and 165.89 ppm and is consistent with the number of expected carbon environments in 15a.

Attempts to isolate x-ray quality crystals of 15a were unsuccessful therefore the potential synthesis of Lewis acid-base adducts 15a was explored through the addition of coordinating solvents in an attempt to stabilize the system. In a typical reaction, 15a was dissolved in 3 mL of cold hexane (0 oC). Coordinating solvents such as Et3N and Et2O were added dropwise to the solution of 15a over 1 minute. Immediate color changes were observed from dark red to yellow (in the case of Et2O), or a clear solution with a small amount of white precipitate (upon addition of Et3N). After removal of the solvent, NMR analysis of the resulting materials was by11B NMR show the adduct formation resulted in

39

downfield shift of the resonance signal versus 15a (Table 3.1) suggesting coordination at boron. Curiously, for the 1H NMR, the resonance signals for the aromatic protons observed in the Et3N adduct of 15a had shifted slightly upfield while for the ether adduct were shifted slightly downfield. In contrast, the 13C NMR analysis showed that in both cases the aromatic resonance signals shifted upfield. These differences could potentially be due to the differences in base strength for the coordinating species.

Subsequent to the attempted preparation of 15a and the corresponding adducts, it was discovered that Braunschweig30 had reported on the synthesis of borole via the same approach. In this work, 15a was isolated as deep blue crystals from toluene in a 87% yield. Unfortunately,
11

B NMR analysis reported for isolated 15a showed a singlet

resonance signal at  = 66.4 ppm was significantly upfield from the experimental value. In this work Braunschweig also prepared coordination adducts of 15a with bases such as 4Me-C5H4N (Pry') in which the boron resonance signal was shifted significantly upfield to  = 5.6 ppm. One significant difference in the experimental procedure of Braunschweig was that the byproduct, Me2SnCl2, was sublimed out of the crude product at 50 °C. Therefore, the differences observed in the NMR data compared to these literature values might be attributed to the presence of Me2SnCl2 which may be coordinating to boron in some fashion.

3.2.2 Analysis of 15b and 15c Attempted Synthesis of Related Adducts
Simultaneous to the preparation of 15a, the same procedures were followed substituting for AlCl3 and GaCl3 in attempts to isolate the corresponding aluminole 15b

40

and gallole 15c. In both cases, the analysis of the crude products by 1H NMR revealed the resonance signals for aromatic protons had shifted slightly downfield compared to the corresponding protons in 10, suggesting a transmetallation had taken place. As with the borole counterpart, attempts to recrystallize 15b and 15c from a variety of solvents were unsuccessful.

As with 15a, coordinating solvents (Et2O and THF) were added to the crude products in an attempt to isolate coordinated adducts of 15b and 15c. In all cases, 1H NMR analysis showed slight upfield shifts for aromatic protons versus the crude products. This suggested that there may be coordination of the ethers to the metal centers. Table 3.1 summarizes the 1H and 13C NMR signals observed for the crude products containing 15b, 15c, and their corresponding adducts. However, as was the case with 15a, failure to remove the Me2SnCl2 byproduct through sublimation may be interfering with attempts to isolate any of the compounds.

3.3. Synthesis of Monomer 16 Precursors 3.3.1 Diethyl Dipropargyl Malonate, [21]

Scheme 3. 4 Diethyl dipropargyl malonate, 22.26 Compound 21 was prepared according to procedures described by Gal26 by reaction of a 1:2.2:2.2 ratio of diethyl malonate: sodium ethoxide: propargyl bromide in ethanol (Scheme 3.4). 42

The reaction was stirred for 12 hrs at 60oC to ensure completion. After removal of EtOH under reduced pressure, the neutral fraction was separated and dissolved in hexane where colourless needle crystals of 21 formed.

Figure 3.1 1H NMR spectra of Diethyl dipropargyl malonate 21.

From the 1H NMR analysis, four resonance signals were obtained: a triplet (-CH3, 3J = 7.1 Hz) at H = 1.26 ppm, a triplet (C-H, 4J = 2.6 Hz) at H = 2.03 ppm, a doublet (CH2C, 4J = 2.6 Hz) at H = 2.99 ppm and a quartet (CH2-O, 3J = 7.1 Hz) at H = 4.24 ppm. The coupling constant 3J = 7.1 Hz and the integration values of 6 and 4 respectively corresponds to the methyl and methylene protons of ester on the structure of 21. Similarly, the coupling constant 4J = 2.6 Hz corresponds to the methylene (CH2-C) and methine

43

(C-H) protons coupling with integration of 4 and 2 respectively. Most importantly, there is no longer any significant signal observed for either the malonate methylene groups (O=C-CH2-C=O at H = 3.36 ppm) or propargyl bromide (CH2-Br at H = 3.30 ppm) starting materials suggesting that the reaction had gone to completion. From the 13C NMR analysis six resonance signals were obtained: at C = 13.98 ppm (-CH3), 22.48 ppm (CH2C), 56.24 ppm (Cquat), 62.05 ppm (-O-CH2-), 71.04 ppm (C-H), 78.43 ppm (-C), 168.58 ppm (C=O) respectively. Both 1H and
13

C NMR results were consistent with the

reported literature values for 21. The overall yield of 83% was a slight improvement compared to the literature value (79%). The melting point of 45-47oC was consistent with the literature (46oC).26

3.3.2 Synthesis of 4,4-bis(hydroxymethyl)-1,6-heptadiyne, [22]
4,4-Bis(hydroxymethyl)-1,6-heptadiyne, 22, was synthesized according to Jin and coworkers27 by reducing 1:5 ratio of diethyl dipropargyl malonate 21 with LiAlH4 in Et2O solution (Scheme 3.5).

Scheme 3. 5 4,4-bis(hydroxymethyl)-1,5-heptadiyne, 22.27

44

During initial attempt to replicate Jin's work at ambient temperature the desired product 22 was not obtained. Therefore, the reaction was repeated with the solution of 21 in Et2O first being cooled to 0 oC followed by subsequent addition of a cooled suspension (0 oC) of LiAlH4 drop wise over a period of 1 hr.

Figure 3.2 1H NMR spectra of 4,4-bis(hexyloxymethyl)-1,6-heptadiyne 22.

A white solid was removed and recrystallized from Et2O at room temperature. 1H NMR analysis of 22 showed four resonance signals were obtained: a triplet at H = 2.05 ppm (C-H, 4J = 2.7 Hz), a broad peak at H = 2.13 ppm (O-H), a doublet at H = 2.38 ppm (CH2-Cquat,4J = 2.7 Hz), and a singlet at H = 3.75 ppm (CH2-O). Methylene (CH2-Cquat) and methine (C-H) protons integrate for 4 and 2 protons respectively and the coupling constant 4J = 2.7 Hz further indicates that these protons are coupled. The characteristic

45

broad peak of O-H and singlet peak for methylene (CH2-O) further support the structure of 22 with integration values of 2 and 4 respectively that corresponds to the number of protons. From
13

C NMR analysis, five resonance signals were obtained: at C =  21.71

(CH2C), 42.03 (Cquat), 66.57 (OCH2), 71.19 (CH), 80.20 (-C) ppm respectively. Both NMR analyses were in good agreement with literature values26 and confirmed the formation of 22.

3.3.3 Synthesis of 4,4-bis(hexyloxymethyl)-1,6-heptadiyne, [23]
4,4-Bis(hexyloxymethyl)-1,6-heptadiyne, 23, was synthesized by adding 1-

bromohexane, and potassium hydroxide to 22 in DMSO following procedures outlined by Tilley and coworkers23 (Scheme 3.6) with slight modification noted below.

Scheme 3. 6 4,4-bis(hexyloxymethyl)-1,6-heptadiyne, 23.23

The recommended eluant of 10/90 ethylacetate/hexane mixture did not provide a clean product as outlined in literature. Various ratios (%ethylacetate/%hexane i.e. 5/95, 10/80, 15/85 and 20/80) were tried and 20% ethylacetate to 80% hexane gave the desired

46

colorless oily product with 80% yield. Therefore, increasing the solvent polarity by higher % of ethyl acetate aids in separating 23 from the mixture.

Figure 3.3 1H NMR spectra of 4,4-bis(hexyloxymethyl)-1,6-heptadiyne 23.

From 1H NMR analysis, 7 resonance signals were obtained: a triplet (-CH3,) at H = 0.89 ppm, a multiplet (-CH2-) at H = 1.26-1.37 ppm, an apparent quintet (-CH2-) at H = 1.51-1.58 ppm, a triplet (C-H, 4J = 2.6 Hz) at H = 1.97 ppm, a doublet (C-CH2, 4J = 2.6 Hz) at H = 2.36 ppm, a singlet (O-CH2-Cquat) at H = 3.38 ppm and a triplet (O-CH2) at H = 3.41 ppm. Looking at the structure of 23, 9 signals are expected yet only 7 were observed due to an overlap of three CH2 signals that appeared as a multiplet at H = 1.261.37 ppm and integrated for 12 protons. The total number of 36 hydrogen was also consistent with the sum of all integrations and 4J coupling of 2.6 Hz was observed between methylene (C-CH2) and methine (C-H ). The absence of O-H broad signal (H = 2.13

47

ppm) from 22 suggested that the starting materials have been completely consumed. For
13

C NMR analysis, eleven resonance signals were obtained at C = 14.05 (-CH3), 21.87,

22.64, 25.80, 29.53, 31.66 (-CH2-), 71.16 (Cquat), 70.26, 71.25 (O-CH2), 71.98 (-CCH), and 80.30 (CHC-) ppm respectively. Both NMR analyses were in good agreement with literature values23 and the formation of 23.

3.3.4 Synthesis of 4,4-bis(hexyloxymethyl)-1,7-bis-p-bromophenyl-1,6heptadiyne, [24]
4,4-Bis(hexyloxymethyl)-1,7-bis-p-bromophenyl-1,6-heptadiyne, 24, was synthesized according to Tilley and coworkers23 (Scheme 3.7). Product 23, 1-bromo-4-iodobenzene, Pd(PPh3)4 and CuI were dissolved in THF under nitrogen atmosphere. Diisopropylamine was then added to promote a Sonogashira reaction31 requires a basic medium to neutralize the byproducts. The mixture was stirred for 2 days.

Scheme 3. 7 4,4-bis(hexyloxymethyl)-1,7-bis-p-bromophenyl-1,6-heptadiyne,24.24

48

A solid white byproduct was removed by filtration. The filtrate was diluted with hexane, washed with 10% NH4OH, water and brine respectively. The filtrate was then dried over MgSO4. After removing the solvent in vacuo, the brownish oily residue was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel, eluting first with hexane as described by Tilley.23 The hexane/ethylacetate = 10:1 mixture did prove unsuccessful and a hexane/ethylacetate = 2:1 ratio for mobile phase allowed for isolation of the colorless oily product in 76% crude yield (slightly lower than the literature yield). Even after column chromatography, analysis of the crude sample by 1H and 13C NMR showed that there were significant amount of impurities remaining in the sample. However, many of the observed resonance signals were in close agreement with literature values.23 Although attempts to purify and isolate 24 have thus far been unsuccessful, fresh samples of 24 were prepared and used in situ for subsequent steps without additional purification rather than column chromatography.

3.3.5 Attempted Synthesis of C35H48Br2SnO2, [26]
Two potential routes for the preparation of 26 (Scheme 3.8), both of which involved the use of 24 that had been prepared in situ, were investigated as part of an attempt to incorporate conjugated boroles into the main chain of a polymer. Unlike the tetraphenylstannole 10, compound 26 has the potential to form polymers through a polycondensation reaction. In the first method, Me2SnCl2 was first dissolved in THF and cooled to -98oC using liquid N2 and MeOH slurry. A solution of n-BuLi in (1M in THF) was then added

49

dropwise to an in situ prepared solution of 24 in cooled THF (-98oC) over a period of 5 minutes under N2 forming compound 25. The mixture was stirred for 15 mins at low temperature followed by the dropwise addition of a solution of Me2SnCl2 over 5 mins. The resulting light yellow mixture was slowly warmed up to room temperature and stirred for 5 hrs.

In the alternate method, a solution of 25 was prepared using the same route as described above and a cooled solution of Cp2ZrCl2 in THF was added dropwise to the mixture over 5 mins forming compound 27. After the reaction mixture was stirred for 15 mins at -98 oC, the solution was slowly warmed to room temperature and stirred for a total of 4 hrs. At this time, a solution of Me2SnCl2 with 10% CuCl32 was added to the reaction mixture at room temperature and the resulting light yellow solution was stirred for an additional 3 hrs.

50

Scheme 3. 8 Synthesis of C35H48Br2SnO2, 26.
119

Sn NMR analysis of both routes showed singlet resonance signals at Sn = 117.60

and 117.44 ppm, respectively. These resonance signals were significantly upfield from the resonance signals expected for Me2SnCl2 (Sn = 144 ppm) and suggest the possible formation of 26 in solution. The 119Sn NMR signal for 26 appeared significantly downfield from the stannole 10 discussed in section 3.1.2. The aromatic rings for 26 may lie in the same plane as the stannole moiety allowing for the greater conjugation of the system compared with 10 where the bulk of the four phenyl substituents prevent each other from aligning with the plane of the stannole which could account for the difference in the observed positions of the resonance signals in the two compounds.

51

Further characterization of 26 using 1H and

13

C NMR, mass spectrometry and

elemental analysis is required for this compound. Attempt to purify and isolate 26 from the crude reaction mixture have thus far been unsuccessful.

3.4. Attempted Synthesis of Polymer 17a·THF
Bonifacio has previously demonstrated that dibrominated diaryl boroles can remain intact during polycondensation polymerization33 under the same conditions utilized by Tilley for Ni(0) mediated coupling in the synthesis of poly(2,5-diphenylgermole).23 BCl3 in hexane was added dropwise over 1 min to a solution of 26 that had been prepared in situ (at -98 oC under N2). The resulting solution turned a scarlet red color and the resulting reaction mixture was stirred for a further 3 hrs after warming to room temperature. An aliquot was removed and analyzed using 11B NMR, which showed a broad resonance signal at B = 30.96 ppm indicating the BCl3 had been consumed. In a separate flask, toluene, DMF, Pd(COD)2 and bypyridine were added under nitrogen and covered with Al foil to protect the sample from light and heated at 60 oC for 20 mins. This mixture was then transferred to the scarlet solution dropwise in the hope of polymerizing any 16a that had been formed in situ. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred for an additional 3 hrs, during which time the colour of the solution changed to light brown. In the hope of producing a material stable enough for GPC analysis in air, THF was subsequently added to the reaction mixture in an attempt to produce the polymer adduct 17a·THF. The resulting solution stirred for 30 mins and the solvent removed in vacuo

52

yielding a thick polymer-like material. The polymer was then purified by precipitation in MeOH and the precipitated polymers were dried in air.

Scheme 3. 9 Synthesis of polymer 17a·THF.

Analysis of the dried polymer using 11B NMR revealed a singlet resonance signal at B = 32.20 ppm similar to what obtained before polymerization indicating that the heterole structure was similar to the monomer that had been prepared in situ. GPC analysis of polymer revealed a molecular weight of 55,000 Da for the sample with PDI = 1.6. The 1H NMR analysis of the material showed very broad resonance signals between H = 0.483.34 ppm, whereas the possible substituents, solvents and impurities signals overlapped with each other between H = 6.73-7.63 ppm in the phenyl region.
13

C NMR analysis

53

provided multiple peaks at C = 10.83-45.13 ppm which could again be from substituents, solvents and impurities and C = 124.78-162.05 ppm for phenyl regions. However, in light of the discovery that Me2SnCl2 must be removed from the crude product of any borole, it is unlikely that the target compounds 16a and 17a were formed. The entire polymerization process must be repeated after purification of 16a and any future attempts to form 17a should not be repeated in situ.

3.5. Molecular Modelling of Group 13 Heteroles
Molecular modeling analysis of 15 (1-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetraphenyl heteroles) and 16 or 16' dibromo heteroles (M = B, Al, Ga) was carried out using Spartan 10 software at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of Density Functional Theory (DFT). These calculations were designed to complement the synthetic studies by acting as a guide for identifying potentially useful target molecules.

Performing efficient calculations required a slight modification of heteroles of type 16, where hexyloxy (OC6H13) had been simplified to methoxy (OCH3) substituents to form 16' (Figure 3.4, 16'). This slight simplification of the structure resulted in a significant reduction of calculation time from days and weeks to only hours. A comparative analysis was done on both 16 and 16' (M = B, Al, Ga) and the calculated energy gap difference (Eg = -0.01 eV (B); -0.08 eV (Al); and +0.01 eV (Ga) showed no significant differences (see Table 3.2) between 16 and 16'. Therefore, all further calculations for the Lewis base adducts of these heteroles were calculated using OCH3 substitutents (16').

54

Figure 3.4 Heteroles 15, 16 and 16'. The graphical model representations for 15 and 16' showed several similarities, including that their heterole unit were all planar (with an endocylic bond angle of 90-100o). The calculated carbon-carbon bond lengths of the heterole unit show alternating areas of  bonding character ( 1.35 Å) and areas where only  bonding is expected ( 1.52 Å) suggesting no delocalization in the heteroles. These bond lengths are more consistent with the bond length observed in coordinated adducts of 15 where antiaromatic character had been broken as reported by Braunschweig.30 In contrast, the planar geometry of the ring and trigonal planar geometry of the group 13 atoms should allow for conjugation with the four carbons, facilitating the delocalization of -electrons and formation of antiaromatic conjugated rings.

55

3.5.1 Methyl, n-Butyl and Phenyl Substituents Effects on 15a.
The effect on energy gap values for various alkyl or aryl substituents on 15a (M = B, R = Me, n-Bu, Ph, Figure 3.6) was analyzed by DFT (Table 3.2).

Figure 3.5 Heteroles 15a, 15a' and 15a''

The energy gap values for Me and n-Bu substituents were very similar (approximately 3.2 eV), yet the Ph substituent was considerabily lower at 2.6 eV. This data suggests that electron donating groups (Me, n-Bu) have a similar effect on the energy gap. In contrast, an electron withdrawing group, (Ph) reduced the energy gap by lowering the LUMO energy level (Table 3.1).

57

Another contributor to this energy difference is the possibility of conjugation between the  cloud of the heterole and that of the Ph substituents. The structure of 15a has a larger delocalized framework (Figure 3.6) compared to 15a' or 15a''. Modification of substituents that are isolated from the  frame work have little effect on the energy gap as has been observed in comparison to 16 to 16' where the isolated electron donating side groups was changed from OC6H13 to OCH3.

As shown in Figure 3.6, the electron density on the LUMO orbitals involve the boron atom, making it a good site for adduct formation. In contrast, the electron density of the HOMO orbitals is largely located on the carbon skeleton with little or no electron density on the boron atom. Also, greater electron density is observed with the Ph

substituents compared to Me and n-Bu substituents, supporting the idea that Ph substituents participate in a greater delocalized system. Therefore, the chemistry of these systems allows for potential electronic fine-tuning via the substituents, where Ph substituent would appear red shifted in UV spectra compared to Me and n-Bu substituents. As a result, this tuning could lead to interesting optoelectronic properties.

An intriguing piece of information identified by DFT calculations at the B3LYP/631G* level is that both boron-containing heteroles, 15a and 16'a, have much narrower energy gaps than those of the corresponding heteroles with Al and Ga (Table 3.3). Theoretically, ascending in a group in the periodic table usually results in a decrease in metal character, resulting in larger energy gap. However, in the case of boron, the borole

59

energy gap is smaller by (15-20% for example; 15a = 2.59 eV, 15b = 3.24 eV, and 15c = 3.04 eV). This could be due to boron's atomic size that allows for better orbital overlap with the carbon atoms of ring system, which in turn affords a lower energy gap. Aluminole and gallole showed very similar energy gaps even though gallole (Ga is found below Al in the group) was expected to show a smaller energy gap than that of aluminole. This similarity in energy gap difference (about 0.2 eV) was observed for both 15 and 16' heteroles (Table 3.2). The DFT calculation also revealed that the HOMO energy levels of the heteroles 15a-c are 0.28-0.40 eV lower compared to cyclopentadiene (Table 3.2). Additionally, their LUMO levels are 1.12-1.45 eV lower in energy than that of Cp. This indicates that the heteroles have better electron affinity than Cp, resulting in a significant lowering of the LUMO energy level.

3.5.2 Effect of Adduct Formation
The energy gap of 15 and 16' (with the Lewis-base adducts formed with THF, Et3N and Et2O) have also been calculated. All adducts provide wider energy gaps compared to their parent compound (Table 3.2). This suggests that the energy gap can also be tuned with adduct formation. The adduct formed between 15 and Et3N (15a·Et3N) provided the narrowest energy gap compared to THF and Et2O analogos. Whereas in the case of 16', an adduct formed with THF had the narrowest energy gap. In general, the Lewis bases (Et3N, THF and Et2O) react via their HOMO orbitals and donate electron pairs whereas Lewis acids (borole, aluminole and gallole) react via their LUMO orbitals and accept electron pairs. As a result, Et3N (through the nitrogen atom) and THF (through the oxygen atom)

60

donate an electron pair into the empty p-orbital of the B, Al and Ga atom to form adducts. Therefore, Et3N and THF appear to be the better -donors than Et2O to stabilize the 15 and 16' respectively, based on the values of energy gap of the bonding molecular orbitals (Lewis acid/base complex). This is counter intuitive because it is expected that the THF would be more similar to the Et2O with respect to base strength and donating abilities than to Et3N.

The effect of adduct formations is also observed in the simulated UV-VIS spectra (Figure 3.7 and 3.8). The parent heteroles are expected to have three major absorption signals each. For 15a, max = 380, 420, and 640 nm while for 16a' max = 350, 400, and 610 nm. The expected absorbances at >600 nm are consistent with the blue colour observed by Braunschweig in the synthesis of 15a. Coordination of any Lewis base would be expected to disrupt the antiaromatic character of the borole resulting in the alteration of the UV-VIS spectra. Calculations have shown coordination of Et3N to either 15a or 16a resulted in the elimination of the absorbance that is responsible for the expected blue colour of the system. The spectra of 15a·Et3N (max = 280 and 380 nm) and 16a'·Et3N (max = 280 and 380 nm) each indicate that the adduct would be expected to be yellow in colour. This is also consistent with the observation of Braunschweig.

3.6. Theoretical Analysis of Oligomeric Heteroles

In order to study the effect of increasing the number of repeating units on the energy gap, calculations for heteroles with up to six repeating units of 15 were analyzed by DFT. Initially it was found that the calculations would fail frequently due to the increasing

63

size of the molecules (number of atoms). Therefore, to obtain the data in Table 3.3, the calculation for 6 repeating units was undertaken at one level higher (B3LYP/6-31G** level) to accommodate more atoms. The remainder of the molecules (with 2, 3, or 4 repeating units) were calculated at (B3LYP/6-31G* level). It should be noted that the two basis sets of 6-31G* and 6-31G** have a similar function, except that 6-31G** also gives p-type polarization functions for hydrogen which adds flexibility to the basis set thus molecular orbitals will be asymmetric about the hydrogen nucleus.23

Up to 3 repeat units of 15a frontier orbitals are shown in Figure 3.9 where electron density is exhibited over the oligomers.

65

It was previously mentioned that the energy gap between HOMO-LUMO decreases in conjugated systems due to the increasing number of -orbitals (Figure 1.2). The more repeating units, the more -orbitals are introduced, therefore the narrower the energy gaps are expected within a molecule. This is shown in Table 3.3 where the energy gap decreased from 2.5 eV for one repeating unit to 2.06 eV for six repeating units. A lower energy gap was observed between each repeating unit. By comparison, changes based upon adduct formation were more significant in comparison to the addition of the number of repeat units beyond the second.

66

CHAPTER 4 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 4.1 Conclusions
Electrical properties governing the group 13 heteroatomic moiety demonstrated interesting results for HOMO-LUMO energy gap. Based on DFT calculations, boroles, possessing a boron atom in its five membered ring provided the lowest calculated energy gap compared to aluminole or gallole. Adduct formations resulted in additional fine-tuning of the monomer energy levels with 15·Et3N and 16·THF adducts possessing the smallest energy gap. Electron donating and withdrawing substituents dramatically impact monomer electronics with more delocalized -electrons in 15a and resulted in the smallest energy gap. Also, it was observed in all cases that the -orbital of LUMO in heteroles involved the main group atom, unlike HOMO orbital that do not hence showed the adduct formation site on the LUMO. DFT also revealed that the B, Al, or Ga in the LUMO orbital participate in the adduct formation. DFT calculation of oligomer units revealed that by increasing the number of repeating units of 15a, a lower HOMO-LUMO energy gap is found. However, the decreased energy gap between each repeat unit was small (Table 3.4) compared to changes based upon adduct formation (Table 3.1). In general, monomers and oligomeric units possess small energy gaps and thus have the potential to be building blocks for the synthesis of low energy gap -conjugated systems.

67

4.2 Future Recommendations
Future work will focus on the synthesis and isolation of monomer precursor 24 where additional precaution on the purifications of starting materials will be taken. Also, the removal of solvents from the product will be done using rotoevaporation rather than just in vacuo on Schlenk line to help separation of the product before introducing it to column chromatography. After obtaining pure 24, isolation of monomer 16a will also be attempted. Tilley and coworkers23 have obtained pure monomer in the germole case (analogous to monomer 16a) by vacuum drying the reaction mixture, then washing with cold pentane and extracting the product into benzene. If this isolation method works for monomer 16a, the next step will be synthesizing monomer 16a and 16b, and subsequently polymer 17a-c. Synthesis of polymeric system should be attempted via a nickel (0) catalyzed condensation polymerization.18 Two types of polymerization could then be analyzed: polymerization following adducts formation versus polymerization of adducts. Then the energy gaps of the two systems and their molecular weight compared.

Purification and isolation of heteroles 15a-c is also required and can be accomplished by sublimation of the crude solid product to remove the unreacted stannole and other impurities.17 Growing crystals will also be attempted to help in identifying the structures of monomers and monomers precursors using x-ray crystallography analysis.
