LIFESTYLE CENTRES: A PLANNER`S DREAM OR NIGHTMARE? A CASE STUDY OF THE SHOPS AT DON MILLS © Lynn Duong, 2012 Master of Planning in Urban Development Ryerson University

ABSTRACT Outlined in the Central Don Mills Secondary Plan, the Don Mills Centre is intended to function as a commercial and community centre to the Don Mills neighbourhood. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Shops at Don Mills serves the local community or does it provide other functions? If so, what are these functions? This study looks at demographics in the area, retailers, policy and legislation, and the function of lifestyle centres in general to determine if the Shops at Don Mills is well integrated into the community.

Three objectives are identified in order to address the research questions presented in this study. The first objective is to determine if lifestyle centres are designed for community and commercial purposes. The second objective is to identify the social makeup of Don Mills. The final objective is to examine present retailers at the Shops at Don Mills to determine the users of the centre and whether it functions as the commercial and community centre to the Don Mills neighbourhood.

Key words: Don Mills, lifestyle centre, retail development, commercial centre, community centre

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
As Canadian cities evolve in the twenty-first century, a major challenge is managing growth pressures in a sustainable manner. In the City of Toronto, designated mixed-use areas can be seen as an attempt to create sustainable urban development. From a theoretical planning perspective, mixed-use areas are an efficient use of land as they, by definition, support a combination of activities such as commercial, office, and retail (Kircher, n.d.; Urban Land Institute, 2008). These mixed-use areas are typically designated along major arterial roads that are transit-accessible, which provides an opportunity for residents to purchase goods and services locally rather than driving to a destination. Due to the combination of land uses and transit accessibility, mixed-use areas often attract a critical mass of people during the day and night (Kircher, n.d.). Overall, these designated areas have created a movement where planners and developers are attempting to build compact complete communities that instil a sense of place where residents would want to live, work, and play. Lifestyle centres are considered to be multi-use developments because they promote single-level land use (i.e. retail), but encourage vertical mixed-use development to occur within its vicinity (Kircher, n.d.). These centres allow compatible uses such as residential and offices to locate around the lifestyle centre, generating synergies between each use. Lifestyle centres are designed in such a way that they resemble modern or traditional downtown streetscapes. They are typically characterized by their open-air organization and upscale retail and service mix (Coleman, 2006; ICSC, 2004; Poag & McEwan Lifestyle Centres, 2010; Thorne, 2002). While research units such as the Centre for the Study of Commercial Activity (CSCA) at Ryerson University, Toronto, looks at the relationships between retail structures in urban

1

landscapes, little research has been conducted on lifestyle centres in North America. This is surprising considering the vast amount of development in the United States.

1.1 OVERVIEW
As Ontario`s first lifestyle centre (Altass, 2008; Baker M. , 2002), the Shops at Don Mills presents an interesting case study for future lifestyle centre development in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Before the arrival of the Shops at Don Mills, the area was a regional shopping centre (Don Mills Shopping Centre) that served retail amenities and needs to the local and wider community. Over time the shopping centre became old and out-dated compared to the newer shopping centres being developed in other parts of Toronto. As a result, the Don Mills Shopping Centre underwent revitalization strategies. The developer, Cadillac Fairview, owner of other retail properties in Toronto such as Fairview Mall and the Eaton Centre, decided to take a new approach on the Don Mills Shopping Centre (Canada News Wire, 2004). The purpose of this new development was to be the focal point for the surrounding residential community and a potential community centre (City of Toronto, 2009). The end result was the development of a lifestyle centre, Shops at Don Mills, a place where people can live, work, and play.

1.2 STUDY AREA
The study area, Don Mills neighbourhood, is centered on the intersection of Don Mills Road and Lawrence Avenue East. The Donway is a circular road that encompasses the intersection and acts as a divider between higher and lower density (shown in Figure 1 on the next page). The inner ring of The Donway has a higher density, with mid-rise buildings and a central commercial centre, whereas the outer ring of The Donway is comprised of low-rise single family residential homes and parkland. Figure 1 also outlines the boundaries for this study,

2

which were identified by the City of Toronto (2006a) in the Central Don Mills Secondary Plan. The southwest quadrant of The Donway, labelled as the Don Mills Centre in the Secondary Plan (2006a) is where the Shops at Don Mills is currently situated and is the focus of this study.

1.3 PURPOSE
Outlined in the Central Don Mills Secondary Plan (2006a), the Don Mills Centre is intended to function as a commercial and community centre to the surrounding Don Mills neighbourhood. The purpose of this study is to determine at what extent does the Shops at Don Mills adhere to the Secondary Plan. This study looks at demographics in the area, retailers, policy and legislation, and the function of lifestyle centres in general to determine if the Shops at Don Mills is well integrated into the community. In order to meet the overall aim of this study, several objectives are identified. The first objective is to determine if lifestyle centres are designed for community and commercial purposes. To complete this first objective, this study provides a review of the academic literature and determines the function of commercial and community centres. The next step is then to define and identify the purpose of lifestyle centres. The second objective is to identify the social makeup of the Don Mills community. Completing such an objective requires a clearly defined boundary of the study area and the characteristics of the individuals whom live in the community. For the purposes of this study, the study area uses the boundaries identified in Figure 1, the same boundaries outlined in the Central Don Mills Secondary Plan (2006a). To determine the demographics of the area, this study uses PCensus software with data from Environics Analytics as the City of Toronto uses a different boundary then the Central Don Mills Secondary Plan (2006a) to collect their demographic information. The combination of PCensus software and Environics Analytics` data provides a useful tool in developing the social makeup of the Don Mills community.

4

From that, the final objective is to look at the retailers present at the Shops at Don Mills and construct a profile of the users of the centre. CSCA collects information about each retailer on an annual basis. This study uses CSCA data to generate a commercial structure analysis, which assesses who shops at the Shops at Don Mills by examining the present retailers. Once completed, the commercial structure analysis of the Shops at Don Mills will be compared against the Don Mills Shopping Centre to see if they are the same, and whether they function as community and commercial centres. Chapter 2 provides the research context through a literature review that includes the functions of a community centre, commercial centre, and the evolution of lifestyle centres. The method is explained in Chapter 3, which comments on the techniques used to conduct this study. The history of the Don Mills neighbourhood is presented in Chapter 4, which includes the evolution of the Don Mills Centre from a neighbourhood plaza to a lifestyle centre, and all relevant planning policies pertaining to the site. The following chapters, Chapters 5 and 6 discuss the neighbourhood`s local` demographics and commercial structure, respectively. Finally, in Chapter 7, conclusions are presented and opportunities for future research are discussed.

CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW
Retail geography is an important area of study in today`s society because it classifies and illustrates the interaction of citizens and the retail landscape. This landscape is characterized by retail developments such as plazas and shopping malls. Over the last decade, the retail landscape has changed dramatically, creating new forms of retail development such as big-box stores and lifestyle centres. Due to the evolution of societal needs, this results in a changing retail landscape. This literature review looks specifically at lifestyle centres to determine if they are capable of functioning as community and commercial centres. As a result, this chapter is comprised of four main sections. The first two sections look at the purpose and role of a community centre and a commercial centre, respectively. The third section looks at the history and evolution of lifestyle centres, with a particular focus on the Shops at Don Mills in Toronto. Finally, looking at the existing literature, the last section determines whether lifestyle centres are designed to function as community and commercial centres.

2.1 COMMUNITY CENTRES
In geography, a place is a section of a landscape, whether it is natural or man-made, that has significance to a person either through the experiences they have, or they are manifested through the landscape (Relph, 1976). The concept of community can refer to geographical borders, such as municipal boundary lines, or they can refer to a group of people with similar interests, such as social groups (McMillian & Chavis, 1986). For the purpose of this study, a community is a derivative of place; it is a powerful relationship between individuals and a

6

landscape. More specifically, a community is a physical concentration of people with similar values and/or beliefs in a particular location (Minar & Greer, 2007; Relph, 1976; Toffer, 1970). Although there is no formal definition of a community centre in the academic literature, people inherently know what a community centre is when they see one. From a planning perspective, community centres are buildings that are generally used by residents of the surrounding neighbourhood for recreational or community activities and/or services (City of North York, 1952; Ministry of Public Infrastructure Renewal, 2006). Community centres are important pieces of infrastructure because they create cohesion within a neighbourhood by allowing residents to participate in recreational and socio-cultural activities. Community centres do not have to be owned and operated by a municipality; they can be buildings that provide a gathering place for local residents. Some examples of community centres include a local pub, a diner, a coffee shop, or a shopping centre (Dunham-Jones & Williamson, 2009). These are places where residents gather, socialize, and most importantly foster a sense of community that planners strive to achieve.

2.2 COMMERCIAL CENTRES
In the academic literature there is no concrete definition of a commercial centre, rather the concept of a commercial centre is synonymously used with the term shopping centre (McKay, 2007; Jones & Simmons, 1993). These places allow retail activity to occur which permits businesses to sell goods to a consumer that does not require further transformation (Statistics Canada, 2012). The idea of a commercial centre can either be formed through store or non-store retailers (Statistics Canada, 2012). Store retailers are fixed locations and are designed to attract a high-volume of customers. They can be free-standing stores such as Staples or Home Depot, or they can be strung together along a street or inside a mall. Non-store retailers, in

7

contrast, do not have physical buildings offering goods, but rather they rely on other methods of marketing such as TV infomercials or internet catalogues. For the purpose of this study, commercial centres are formed by store retailers. The City of Toronto`s Official Plan (2009) recognizes the importance of retail to the economy. Section 3-34 of the Official Plan (2009) also acknowledges the fact that shopping centres not only provide basic retail needs, but also act as focal points of community activity. Shopping centres are places that generate community vitality as these places are in close proximity to residential neighbourhoods, which encourages people to walk rather than drive. The following section discusses lifestyle centres, more specifically the Shops at Don Mills, as an example of a retail development that has attempted to capture a sense of community and function as a commercial hub.

2.3 LIFESTYLE CENTRES
Lifestyle centres combine aspects of a mall and downtown street life to provide customers with a unique and convenient shopping experience that is traditionally not found in an enclosed shopping centre. These developments tend to attract customers who frequent malls and those who would not go to the mall for their shopping by providing them with a unique experience of retail and public amenities (Coleman, 2006). The configuration of a lifestyle centre represents a typical downtown streetscape with upscale and modern retailers, entertainment complexes, and food services. Lifestyle centres are generally found in residential neighbourhoods and are geared towards young urban professionals (Barson, 2005; Coleman, 2006).

8

2.3.1 HISTORY
The first lifestyle centre was developed in 1987 by Dan Poag and Terry McEwan in Memphis, Tennessee (Poag & McEwan Lifestyle Centres, 2010). Since then the development of lifestyle centres has grown exponentially. By the end of 2002 there were about 30 reported lifestyle centres in the United States, this grew to 150 by the end of 2006 (USA Today, 2007). On the following page, Figure 2 outlines the emergence of lifestyle centres starting with the unplanned hierarchy, which refers to downtown retailing and department stores (Jones & Simmons, 1990; Jones & Simmons, 1993). Following this era was the planned hierarchy, which gave rise to different types of suburban shopping centres from the 1950s till the 1980s. The common element that is predominant in the planned hierarchy is the fact that the shopping centres cater to a set number of customers with different needs. Each of these shopping centres evolved over time due to changes in consumer behaviour, demographics, entrepreneurial activities, and technological advances (Jones & Hernandez, 2006). For more detail about each retail development, please refer to Appendix A. There is no doubt that all retail developments need to undergo renovations after a certain period of time to remain competitive. Jones and Hernandez (2006) suggest that shopping centres that were developed in the 1950s are in need of renovations after 10-15 years. In general, a majority of mall developers have focused on renovations, which tend to include new and upscale designs to improve mall facilities. The purpose of these renovations is to maintain current clientele and attract new ones by using newer building materials and technology. However, with new retail formats appearing, such as big-box stores, former retail developments need to remain competitive.

The era of regional shopping centre development has long past. Due to the age of each shopping centre they are reaching a critical point where revitalization or redevelopment can occur. Leong (2001) suggests that shopping centres are constantly being reinvented and repackaged to keep up with societal changes. Some retail developers have found a strategy to revitalize and redevelop aging shopping centres and commercial strips ­ lifestyle centres.

2.3.2 DEFINITION
The rapid development of lifestyle centres should be taken with caution as the literature on defining them varies (Coleman, 2006; ICSC, 2004; Poag & McEwan Lifestyle Centres, 2010; Thorne, 2002). The International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC) has defined lifestyle centres as an open-air development with at least 50,000 square feet of retail space, located near affluent residential neighborhoods, and may be anchored by big-box stores and/or entertainment establishments such as cinemas (ICSC, 2010). Please see Appendix B for a list of authors and developers that have defined lifestyle centres. Developers are constructing more lifestyle centres due to the increased popularity of the term. However, Hernandez (2007) argues that majority of lifestyle centre development are actually decorative power centres ­ a cluster of big-box stores strung together with a shared parking lot (Jones & Hernandez, 2006). The term lifestyle centres should not be confused with retail mixed-use developments. According to ICSC (2010) retail mixed-use developments differ from lifestyle centres because they offer environments that are conducive to casual browsing by offering a variety of restaurants, speciality stores, and urban public amenities such as fountains and street furniture. Yet Hernandez (2007) and ICSC`s American definition (2004) has classified this type of development as a lifestyle centre.

11

Despite differing terminology, there are two main characteristics of lifestyle centres that academics and developers have agreed upon. First, lifestyle centres are open-air developments that allow customers to experience a vibrant high quality pedestrian environment. Second, lifestyle centres are built in close proximity to affluent residential neighbourhoods, which is reflected in the upscale chain speciality retailers and/or services present in these developments. This study will use these characteristics as a way to identify lifestyle centres in Canada.

2.3.3 CANADIAN LIFESTYLE CENTRES
Lifestyle centre development in Canada has taken place at a slower pace when compared to the United States. In 2007, three lifestyle centres were fully constructed (see Figure 3), located in the three largest Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs): Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. Shops at Don Mills in Toronto, Centropolis in Montreal, and Park Royal in West Vancouver are examples of lifestyle centres in the Canadian retail landscape (Hernandez, 2007).
The Shops at Don Mills:

The Village at Park Royal:

Figure 3 ­ Lifestyle Centres in Canada

12

More lifestyle centres have been developed since then, by the end of 2011 there have been 6 lifestyle centres identified (see Table 1). These lifestyle centres are based upon ICSC`s definition for Canadian lifestyle centres, which slightly differs from American lifestyle centres as shown in Appendix B.

Many of these lifestyle centre developments are located at major highway interchanges, which may indicate that shoppers tend to drive to these complexes.

2.4 SUMMARY
In this chapter, a brief review of literature on community, commercial, and lifestyle centres was presented. From this review, it was determined that a community centre`s main function is to allow residents to gather and socialize. Community centres can be formal places such as a recreational centre that provides recreational and socio-cultural activities, or they can be informal, such as coffee shops and diners. A commercial centre`s main function on the other hand is comprised of private businesses that provide goods and/or services directly to a consumer. Both community and commercial centres were highlighted in planning policies such

13

as the Toronto Official Plan (2009) to be vital to the success of building healthy and sustainable neighbourhoods for residents to live in. The emergence of lifestyle centres has been a way for older and aging shopping centres to redevelop in order to remain competitive in the retail landscape. Although there is no formal universal definition of a lifestyle centre, they embody two main characteristics. First, lifestyle centres are open-air developments that allow customers to experience a vibrant pedestrian atmosphere. Second, lifestyle centres are built in close proximity to affluent residential neighbourhoods, which results in upscale and high-end retailers. As Hernandez (2007) pointed out, these limited characteristics have led to different forms of lifestyle centres in Canada and the United States. The design and configuration of these centres vary, but their size can be equivalent to regional and super-regional shopping centres. This fact alone suggests that lifestyle centres have a large trade area, drawing people at least 30 kilometers away from the centre. This literature review has demonstrated that information about lifestyle centres is limited; and the majority of the work is focused on the United States. Since 2007, more lifestyle centres have been developed throughout Canada. By the end of 2011 there were 6 reported lifestyle centres in Canada, the majority of them located in Québec. In the following chapter the research method used in this study is presented, which aims to address this question of whether the Shops at Don Mills functions as a commercial and community centre to the local Don Mills neighbourhood.

14

CHAPTER 3: RESEARCH APPROACH
This study is exploratory in nature due to the limited literature and lack of publically available data. As a result this study primarily uses field and historical-comparative research, which are qualitative research methods to understand whether the Shops at Don Mills functions as a commercial and community centre. Field research allows an investigator to collect data from an area over a period of time (Newman, 2003). This study uses site visits to the Don Mills neighbourhood as well as the Shops at Don Mills to fully understand the dynamics of the community. Field research is used in conjunction with historical-comparative research, which allows an investigator to compare social trends (Newman, 2003). This study reviews planning policies, neighbourhood demographics, and the commercial structure of the Shops at Don Mills and former Don Mills Shopping Centre. The following sections not only describe the approaches used for the historical-comparative analysis, but also provide a rationale for each approach along with the limitations of this study.

3.1 POLICY REVIEW
A policy review will provide the necessary and relevant background information to assess the current state of the Shops at Don Mills. Relevant policy documents include, but are not limited to the City of Toronto`s Official Plan (2009); zoning by-laws from the former City of North York (1952) and City of Toronto (2009); urban design guidelines Cadillac Fairview and Pellow & Architects developed (2006); the Central Don Mills Secondary Plan (2006a); and the Site Plan Application filled by Cadillac Fairview (No. 05 204361 NNY 25 SA) (2006b). Each piece of policy and legislation prescribes how the built form should be designed and function.

15

The review looks at policy dating back to 2001, when the redevelopment project was initiated, through to the present day. Many of the planning policies and legislative documents are available to the public online. In order to find relevant policies relating to the Shops at Don Mills, this study looked at staff reports issued by the City of Toronto (2009) written by the local area planner Steve Forrester. These reports are crucial as they highlight all of the policy and regulatory framework that is subject to the site.

3.2 DEMOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS
A demographic analysis illustrates the dimensions and dynamics of a population. This analysis is critical to this study as it will provide an assessment of the current population in Don Mills. In order to determine the characteristics of the Don Mills residents, a boundary must be clearly defined. For consistency, this study will use the same boundaries outlined in the Central Don Mills Secondary Plan (2006a) (Figure 1). Although the City of Toronto collects demographic data for Don Mills, their boundary includes the Banbury neighbourhood, which does not coincide with the boundaries outlined in the Secondary Plan. As a result, PCensus software was used with data for the demographic analysis provided by Environics Analytics. The demographic analysis includes the total population of the defined area, age cohorts, median household income, but also the types of lifestyles that are present in the area based upon demographics and social values. This lifestyle grouping is known as geo-demographics, which enables marketers to predict a consumer`s behavioural response based upon statistical models and their location (Goss, 1995). Geo-demographics is a crucial part of the demographic analysis because it is an efficient way of describing the character of Don Mills residents.

16

3.3 COMMERCIAL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS
The aim of this study is to determine whether the Shops at Don Mills functions as a commercial and community centre to the surrounding Don Mills neighbourhood. Initially, this study was going to use a consumer survey (see Appendix C) asking specific questions about what they believed the lifestyle centre`s function was. However, there were many challenges with this approach. Firstly, Cadillac Fairview has a strict policy regarding conducting research on-site as they feel that patrons should not be disturbed during their shopping experience. A solution to this was to try and conduct the consumer survey along the periphery of the retail development. But doing such raised serious issues regarding the safety for the primary investigator and the overall survey as many of the patrons that visit the Shops at Don Mills drive and would be hard to intercept them. Secondly, due to the given timeline for this study it would be challenging regardless if a consumer survey was employed. The amount of time required to administer the survey, gather responses, and interpret results would go beyond the limited timeframe. As a result, this study uses a commercial structure analysis for both the Shops at Don Mills and former Don Mills Shopping Centre examining the retailers to infer the types of people who shop there. From the analysis, if the Shops at Don Mills and the former Don Mills Shopping Centre attract a certain demographic group that is similar to the characteristics found in the demographic analysis, this would indicate that the types of retailers present reflect and reinforce a community and commercial centre atmosphere. However, if the two profiles differ from one another, this would suggest that the Shops at Don Mills does not cater to the local community members, rather the Shops at Don Mills serves other functions (i.e., drawing customers primarily from outside the local area).

This commercial structure analysis is based on a market approach, which studies the supply and demand of a particular product. Due to the competitive nature of retailing, a market` approach identifies whether the present customer base is sufficient to support a retail centre, who shops at a centre and what do they buy, it evaluates the current location, and determines whether a retail centre meets the consumers demands (Urban Land Institute, 2008). This analysis looks at the stores at the Shops at Don Mills and based upon a criterion, will decide if the retailers that are present cater to the local community. For a complete list of all the retailers present at the Shops at Don Mills and former Don Mills Shopping Centre, this study uses data collected by CSCA, which is collected and updated on an annual basis. This commercial structure analysis was created based upon Ailawadi and Keller`s (2004) study Retail Branding. The authors determine that there are five main characteristics that create a successful brand, they are: access, store atmosphere, price and promotion, cross-category assortment, and within-category assortment (Ailawadi & Keller, 2004). For a complete criterion that was used in this study, please see Appendix D. Access is the first dimension that Ailawadi and Keller (2004) discuss. They define access as the distance travelled to obtain a good and/or service. For the purpose of this study, access is delineated by the distance a shopper would have to travel from one particular retailer to the next. The further apart a store is the larger the trade area, which means that shoppers are willing to travel greater distances to purchase a particular good and/or service. The second criterion that used was store atmosphere. This refers to the pleasantness, arousal, and dominance a retailer emits when a shopper enter their store. Store atmosphere can be easily measured by determining a store`s lighting, design, layout, and ambient features such as music and smell. The commercial structure analysis evaluates store atmosphere through three

18

possible choices: high, medium, or low. A high store atmosphere would indicate that a retailer has a pleasant colour scheme and attractive facilities, which helps to highlight the quality of merchandise sold. In contrast, a retailer with low store atmosphere may not be interested in decorative features, rather their main focus is on the merchandise sold rather than the experience a shopper has in its store. Due to the nature of this dimension, this variable is subjective and based upon the primary investigator`s experience at each retailer. In order to evaluate the store atmosphere for the former Don Mills Shopping Centre, this study uses the closest retailer. It is assumed that chain stores have the same look and feel because it is derived from corporate headquarters. However, this assumption is difficult for independent stores, as it is based upon the individual storekeeper to decide on store atmosphere. Unless individual stores re-located elsewhere, store atmosphere cannot be measured effectively. Price and promotion is the third dimension and is measured though store price perceptions, retailer pricing format, and price promotion induced store switching. The perception a consumer has of a store price will influence how often they shop there and the items they buy. Store price perception is based upon the variables identified by Baker et al. (2002), which includes but not limited to merchandise quality, design, music, time, and psychic cost. Using Baker et al.`s (2002) metric a retailer can have a maximum score of 21, which indicates that a consumer is more inclined to make a purchase. A retailer`s pricing format can positioned as Every Day Low Pricing (EDLP) or HighLow Promotional Pricing (HILO). A retailer that is recognized as EDLP generally sells convenience goods at competitive prices. A HILO retailer, in contrast will market their merchandise at a higher price than other retailers, but draws consumers in when their merchandise is on sale.

19

Price promotion is based upon the frequency a product goes on sales, which varies upon a continuum of very frequent to never. To determine the frequency of price promotion at the Shops at Don Mills, this study uses their main website, which indicates promotions and sales at the centre. Site visits demonstrated the frequency of store promotion, pricing format of each individual retailer, and the overall design and layout of the store, which will determine a consumer`s store price perception. Determining the price promotion at the former Don Mills Shopping Centre was difficult as many of the stores were replaced with retailers at the Shops at Don Mills. To overcome this challenge, this study looked at the proximity to the nearest retailer and based the price and promotion from that particular location. The fourth criterion is cross-category assortment. This refers to the customer`s perception of the range of different products and services a retailer carries. The variety of different products and services influences how a store is designed and organized. This study uses the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), which provides a standardized category for all establishments. NAICS is normally comprised of six-digits. For the purposes of this study, the first four-digits are used as it represents the industry group. (Statistics Canada, 2012). The fourdigit NAICS code is useful in assessing a store`s cross-category assortment and is collected by CSCA through their annual retailers` database. The final criterion is within-category assortment, which is the customer`s perception of the depth of a retailer`s assortment. For example, a convenience store may have a wide range of products sold, but not a wide range of a particular good, such as gum. However, a candy store has a wide range of selection of gum, more so than a convenience store, but a candy store does not have a wide variety of goods as they only sell sweets.

20

These five elements (see Table 2) combined will provide a summary of the type of people who frequent the Shops at Don Mills.

3.5 QUALITY & LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY
Due to the nature of historical-comparative research, this study is designed from a theoretical aspect because of data availability. Although the policy, demographic, and commercial structural analysis help determine whether the Shops at Don Mills functions as a commercial and community centre, there are several limitations to this study. The first limitation is the limited applied research to this study. While a survey would be more appropriate in determining how consumers perceive the Shops at Don Mills. Due to the limited timeframe and Cadillac Fairview`s policy with regards to conducting research on-site, a consumer survey is not possible, and a more theoretical approach is taken using the demographic and commercial structural analysis. The second limitation is the subjective nature of the commercial structural analysis. For instance, some categories such as store atmosphere are based on personal tastes and preferences from site visits. However, due to the nature of this study, descriptive research is necessary to fully understand the users of the lifestyle centre.

CHAPTER 4: DON MILLS
The purpose of this chapter is to provide background information about Don Mills and the development of the Don Mills Centre from Post World War II until the present day. This chapter describes the transformation of the Don Mills Centre, with particular attention to the revitalization of the former Don Mills Shopping Centre into the Shops at Don Mills. This chapter also includes relevant planning policies that pertain to the site and highlights some of the obstacles and challenges the developer, Cadillac Fairview, faced with the local residents.

4.1 HISTORY OF DON MILLS NEIGHBOURHOOD
Designed and constructed by urban planner Macklin Hancock between 1952 and 1965, Don Mills embodies principles of Ebenezer Howard`s Garden City (Sewell, 1993; Grant, 2000). As Canada`s first planned post-war suburban community, there is an emphasis on open space, a balance of employment, and residential buildings all of which is surrounded by a greenbelt. These elements in Don Mills have served as a template for suburban development in Canada and around the world (City of Toronto, 2009; Sewell, 1993). In 1997, Don Mills was enacted as a heritage site by the Ontario Heritage Foundation for its integral and consistent planning principles (City of Toronto, 2009). There were five main planning principles that went into the design and development of the Don Mills neighbourhood. These principles include:  Creating four neighbourhood quadrants that surround a central commercial and community centre
 

Separating pedestrian and vehicular traffic Promoting modern architecture

4.2 POLICY REVIEW
This section of the study discusses the planning policy and legislation that has guided the redevelopment of the Don Mills Centre. This section looks at policies that have been enacted from the Provincial level down to the municipal level. Please refer to Appendix E for specific policies that relate to the retail development. The Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) is a piece of legislation passed down from the Province of Ontario that sets directions for municipalities in Ontario to promote a clean and healthy environment along with a strong economy (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2005). Along with the PPS, the Places to Grow (2006) legislative act, guides areas within the Greater Golden Horseshoe to revitalize downtown areas and directs growth in others. Since Cadillac Fairview filed the application to redevelop the area in 2001, both the PPS and Places to Grow do not apply. Instead, the area is subject to the 1997 PPS (City of Toronto, 2009). In the City of Toronto, the Official Plan (2009) provides insight on creating an attractive and safe city that instils a sense of community towards all age groups (City of Toronto, 2009). Because Cadillac Fairview filled their redevelopment application in 2001, the Official Plan (2009) had not been written yet. However, the Official Plan (2009) designates the south western quadrant of The Donway, where the shopping centre is, as a mixed-use area (City of Toronto, 2009). Under the Official Plan (2009), mixed-use designations can accommodate a broad range of activities; the most common of which are commercial and residential uses. The purpose of mixed-use areas is to absorb and attract much of the growth around employment, retail, and commercial areas that is expected to occur in the City. However, it is stated in the Official Plan (2009) that all designated mixed-use areas will not experience the same intensity and scale. In

25

addition to land use designation, the Official Plan also includes policies (Section 3.1.2.1 to 3.1.2.6 of the Official Plan) that address the concern of new development and how they must fit within the context of the surrounding area (City of Toronto, 2009). Before amalgamation in 1998, the City of Toronto was divided into 6 municipalities ­ North York, East York, York, Scarborough, Etobicoke, and the former City of Toronto. Any redevelopment in the Don Mills area is subject to the North York Official Plan (1990). Land where the former Don Mills Centre was is designated as commercial under the North York Official Plan (1990). A commercial designation allows for retailing, commercial, office, and residential uses (City of Toronto, 2009). Furthermore, the Don Mills community is subject to a secondary plan, Central Don Mills Secondary Plan (City of Toronto, 2006a). The main objective of a secondary plan is to preserve the commercial function of commercial areas while permitting complementary uses that enhance the commercial area and make efficient use of lands. In addition to maintaining the character of the Don Mills neighbourhood, the Secondary Plan (2006a) specifically comments on the previous Don Mills Centre, stating that it is  intended to function as the commercial and community centre of the Don Mills Community (City of Toronto, 2009, p. 5). Furthermore, the Secondary Plan (2006a) also provides design and development guidelines that relate to pedestrian movement, building facades, parking structures, landscaping, and accessible spaces for indoor and outdoor activity. Subject to these planning policies and regulations, the following section will describe how Cadillac Fairview transformed the Don Mills Centre from a neighbourhood strip plaza to a lifestyle centre.

26

4.3 DON MILLS CENTRE
Neighbourhoods are constantly evolving and changing in the City of Toronto. Since the development of Don Mills, the south-western quadrant has been designed to serve retail needs of the residents.

4.3.1 ORIGINAL CENTRE
The first development in the area was a neighbourhood strip plaza (Cadillac Fairview; Pellow & Associates Architect Inc., 2006). Figure 5 is a view of what the former plaza looked like. From the literature, neighbourhood plazas are designed to serve the basic convenience needs of the local community. They contain no more than 10 retailers and provide lower-order goods and services such as convenience stores and daily newspaper stands (Urban Land Institute, 1999).
Figure 5 ­ Don Mills Convenience Centre

This retail plaza opened up in 1955 and contained a Dominion Supermarket, Koffler`s Drug Store

Source: (Winston, 2009)

(what is now a Shoppers Drug Mart), Brewer`s Retailer, and other small independent stores (Cadillac Fairview Corporation, 2011; Cadillac Fairview; Pellow & Associates Architect Inc., 2006). What was then called the Don Mills Convenience Centre, the plaza provided residents not only with convenience retail items but also walkways and landscaped open areas, which served as part of the public realm. As Don Mills grew in popularity, the population increased, which meant that there was a need for more retailers to serve a larger population. By 1965 the neighbourhood plaza had

27

transformed itself into a suburban shopping centre, with more than 65 stores serving the local community (Cadillac Fairview Corporation, 2011; McKay, 2007). Between 1997 and 1998 the Don Mills Shopping Centre went through revitalization strategies to remain competitive in the retail landscape and maintain current clientele and hopefully attract new ones (Cadillac Fairview Corporation, 2011). Figure 6 shows what the shopping centre looked like after its renovations. During this time period, power centres had just emerged into the Canadian landscape, which meant that other retail formats needed to be creative if they wanted to survive.

4.3.2 REDEVELOPMENT PHASE 1
With the saturation of suburban shopping centres, power nodes, and other retail formats, the Don Mills Shopping Centre became a primary destination for elderly residents in the area to gather and socialize in the food court. Cadillac Fairview, owners of the Don Mills Shopping Centre, felt that it was time to redevelop the shopping centre. This redevelopment called for the complete demolition of the existing shopping centre to make way for a new type of development ­ a lifestyle centre (Cadillac Fairview Corporation, 2011; City of Toronto, 2009). Redevelopment of the Don Mills Shopping Centre started in 2001, when the owner decided to take a new approach (City of Toronto, 2009). The redevelopment called for a creation of a mixed-use development; expansion of retail, service, and entertainment spaces; relocation

28

and reconstruction of a new Don Mills Civitan Arena (community recreational centre); hotel space; additional office space; and residential units located in five condominium buildings, (City of Toronto, 2009). However, there were numerous issues that were identified with this proposed plan, such as the relocation of the arena, and the traffic impacts on the area; therefore, plans were placed on hold. Figure 7 illustrates the initial proposed redevelopment.

Figure 7 ­ Don Mills Redevelopment Site Plan

Source: (City of Toronto, 2009) In 2004, Cadillac Fairview teamed up with FRAM Building Group and revised the proposal and requested increased density; with a series of new private streets; renovations to the mall to create a new outdoor retail that was to be surrounded by an open square. However, this revised plan left out the arena (City of Toronto, 2009). Once again, this revised report raised

29

issues from the community regarding the built form and density; the function of this new development as the commercial and community centre of Don Mills; and the need to include the arena as part of the redevelopment (City of Toronto, 2009; Sunshine, 2006). A community consultation meeting was held on April 11, 2006 by Cadillac Fairview to present their new proposal to the local residents. Approximately 1,100 members attended this meeting, as it was one of the largest public gatherings the City of Toronto had ever witnessed (City of Toronto, 2006b). The Don Mills Friends, a local community volunteer group, whose main purpose is to ensure that the proposed development conformed to the character of the neighbourhood as identified in the Secondary Plan (Don Mills Friends, 2006). This community group felt that Cadillac Fairview had ignored the main principles of Don Mills and the Secondary Plan, which was to  strengthen the function of the Don Mills as a community centre (City of Toronto, 2006a, p. 2). Instead, residents that attended this community consultation felt that the lifestyle centre would te ar apart a community (Fioritto, 2006a, p. 1). For many senior residents in the area, the former Don Mills Shopping Centre functioned as a community centre. The food court acted as a gathering spot where seniors could socialize with one another and take refuge from the harsh winter weather (Sunshine, 2006; Fioritto, 2006b). However, with an outdoor retail development this would be non-existent. Simone Gabbay, the founder of Don Mills Friends stated: ...this was a planned community...the developer smashed it. They broke the connection between the people and the merchants. (Fioritto, 2006b, p. 2). Another concern that was raised during the community consultation was the fear of relocation. During the redevelopment phase many independent shopkeepers feared the idea of relocating because they felt it would force them out of business (City of Toronto, 2006b; Benitah, 2006).

30

Out of the 36 independent retailers in the former Don Mills Shopping Centre, only one (Ko`s Gift Shop) relocated back into the Shops at Don Mills. Other independent retailers either relocated to the adjacent neighbourhood plaza (49 The Donway), moved elsewhere, or went out of business. By the end of 2005, Cadillac Fairview had filed a site plan control application in order to proceed with Phase One of the development, which consisted of the retail/commercial portion (City of Toronto, 2009). A few months later, in 2006, Cadillac Fairview appealed to the Ontario Municipal Board (OMB) on the basis that the City of Toronto failed to approve the applications within the 30 day timeframe outlined in the Planning Act s.41 (12) (Ministry of Ontario, 1990). In December 2006, the OMB approved the application, and Phase One of the redevelopment began. Simultaneously, Cadillac Fairview made several revisions from the original 2001 proposal with regards to the residential buildings that were to be constructed, which was labelled as Phase Two of the redevelopment. In 2008, the local residents association, Don Mills Residents Inc. (DMRI), worked with Cadillac Fairview to agree upon the size and nature of the recreation/community centre (City of Toronto, 2009). Finally, in April 2009, the Shops at Don Mills opened its door to the general public (Cadillac Fairview Corporation, 2011).

4.3.3 REDEVELOPMENT PHASE 2&3
The result of the redevelopment extends beyond the Shops at Don Mills as the entire area has transformed itself into a mixed-use neighbourhood. Phase Two of the redevelopment began in 2011 and will provide residential homes (see Figure 8 on the following page). Condominiums are currently under construction and located directly south of the Shops at Don Mills and are expected to be completed by the end of 2014. The third and final phase will provide community

31

amenities, such as a newly built community centre (Altass, 2008). Even though the Shops at Don Mills provides an open space for people to use, this is not enough as residents highlighted a lack of community space in the neighbourhood, specifically the need for a publically accessible community centre (City of Toronto, 2009; City of Toronto, 2006b; Fioritto, 2006a). As a result, the community centre will be constructed in proximity to the new residential developments.

Figure 8 ­ Redevelopment Phase 2 &3

Source: (City of Toronto, 2009) Once completed, the area will provide built form and function along with opens spaces where residents can live, work, and play; that is, everything that contemporary planners strive to achieve through their policy and legislation ­ a mixed-use environment.

32

4.4 SHOPS AT DON MILLS
The Shops at Don Mills is a lifestyle centre that is part of a redevelopment strategy outlined by Cadillac Fairview (City of Toronto, 2009). Due to the age of the shopping centre and the proximity of regional shopping centres such as Fairview Mall and Bayview Village, the former Don Mills Shopping Centre was located in a saturated market and needed a makeover. Rather than revitalizing the shopping centre and to compete with other regional shopping centres, the Shops at Don Mills now caters to a different market ­ upper -middle class citizens in and around the area (Thorne, 2002).

4.4.1 LAYOUT & ORGANIZATION
The layout (Figure 9) of the complex resembles a modern urban village

configuration. The curved grid-shaped pattern and decorative store fronts simulates retailing on a Main Street or downtown. The purpose of Main Street retailing is to showcase various retailers using a unifying scheme that reflects the identity and character of the area (Cadillac Fairview; Pellow & Associates Architect Inc., 2006). An example of an upscale Main Street
Figure 9 ­ Shops at Don Mills Layout

would be Bloor Street in midtown Toronto between Yonge Street and University Avenue.

33

4.4.2 RETAIL TYPES
The main anchors of the Shops at Don Mills are the LCBO, McEwan (an upmarket grocery store), Metro, and TD Canada Trust, as shown in Figure 9. Retail space is generally comparable to the space found in a regional and super-regional shopping centre, but one difference is that the anchors are smaller scaled big-box stores. Footwear, restaurants, and women`s clothing are the predominant comparison shop` retailers in the Shops at Don Mills. For further detail, a commercial structure analysis is conducted in this study, which describes the types of retailers found at this retail development, presented in Chapter 6.

4.4.3 OPEN SPACE & PUBLIC AMENITIES
The curved private road layout at the Shops at Don Mills lead to the public square, which is at the centre of the retail complex. Retailers such as coffee shops, restaurants, and cafes are adjacent to the public square. These retailers have large open-air seating areas at the front of their store to allow shoppers and residents to gather and socialize; all of which supports a dynamic and vibrant public square (Cadillac Fairview; Pellow & Associates Architect Inc., 2006). Figure 10 illustrates some of the public amenities in the public square.

Figure 10 ­ Public Square

34

Similar to a central square in a downtown setting, the public square at the Shops at Don Mills functions as a year-round civic space. During the warmer months, the open green space allows customers to watch other shoppers pass by from restaurant patios, as shown in Figure 10. On special occasions such as holidays, the public square functions as a concert and/or festival venue. During the colder months, this open green space is transformed into a skating rink, similar to Devion Park at Ryerson University, and Peace Arches at Nathan Phillips Square.

CHAPTER 5: DEMOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS
This section of the study provides detailed demographic information about the Don Mills neighbourhood. Not all people define the Don Mills` area in the same way, and for consistency this study uses the same boundaries that the City of Toronto has outlined in the Central Don Mills Secondary Plan (2006a). This study uses PCensus for MapInfo software with data from Environics Analytics, which is aggregated data from the Census conducted by Statistics Canada (Tetrad Computer Applications, 2011; Environics Analytics, 2010). In 2005, the total population of the Don Mills neighbourhood was little over 12,000 persons (Figure 11). By 2010, the population in the area increased by approximately 20% bringing the number to 14,693. The figure shows that there is minimal population growth expected in Don Mills through 2020.

Source: (Environics Analytics, 2010) Figure 12 on the following page is a graph that illustrates the population by age cohort. There is a perception that Don Mills has a high proportion of senior residents. The City of Toronto reports that the proportion of seniors living in Don Mills is much higher than the rest of the City (City of Toronto, 2006c). However, Figure 12 demonstrates that, in actuality, adults ranging from 25-64

36

make up nearly half of the population. The graph also shows that the youth population will decline over the next few years, whereas the adult and senior population will see an increase. This indicates that Don Mills is an area in transition. Population by Age Cohort

The high proportion of adults results in a high percentage of the residents who are in the work force. Figure 14 outlines household income of the area. The chart shows that a large proportion of the working population has a household income greater than $100,000. However, the median household income is $67,078, which is slightly above Toronto`s average of $66,790 (Statistics Canada, 2011; Environics Analytics, 2010). This would suggest that the Don Mills neighbourhood is within the middle class income bracket when compared to the rest of the City. However, what this figure does not account for is the number of persons per household that contribute to the overall household income. 2010 Household Income ($) Under $10,000 $ 10,000 - $19,999 $ 20,000 - $29,999 $ 30,000 - $39,999 $ 40,000 - $49,999 $ 50,000 - $59,999 $ 60,000 - $69,999 $ 70,000 - $79,999 $ 80,000 - $89,999 $ 90,000 - $99,999 $ 100,000 and Over Percentage of Household (%)s Don Mills City of Toronto 3.70% 7.10% 5.90% 9.70% 7.70% 9.70% 8.80% 9.80% 8.60% 8.90% 9.00% 8.10% 8.90% 7.30% 8.40% 6.30% 7.40% 5.40% 5.80% 4.50% 25.90% 23.30%

Figure 15 ­ Lifestyle Types

Source: (Environics Analytics, 2010) There are two dominant lifestyles present in Don Mills, Young Digerati and Grey Pride. The first lifestyle group, Young Digerati, makes up a majority of the residents in Don Mills. These individuals are under the age of 40 and are well-educated, placing them in the lowermiddleclass to high class income bracket, earning roughly $122,898. These individuals do not have families of their own and are classified as the urban trendsetters (Tetrad Computer Applications, 2011). The second largest lifestyle types are labeled as Grey Pride. These individuals are a mix of low to middle-class incomes; they tend to be middle-aged or older couples whom live in apartment-dwellings (Tetrad Computer Applications, 2011). The next largest lifestyle type is

City of Toronto

39

classified as Newcomers Rising. Individuals classified in this category tend to be immigrants with post-secondary education. Newcomers Rising are either young singles, couples, or families employed in service sector jobs with lower to middle income levels (Tetrad Computer Applications, 2011). For a complete description of each lifestyle type in Don Mills, please refer to Appendix F. This section has illustrated that there is a mix of different lifestyles in Don Mills. In terms of age, Don Mills houses a slightly older population than compared to the City of Toronto. In terms of the lifestyles present, there seems to be two different types of groups that live in the neighbourhood. The first group are relatively young, well-educated individuals, couples, and small families with a high income bracket. The second group is comprised of elderly seniors that generally live in high-rise apartments, and have lower-middle incomes. Compared to Toronto, the dominant lifestyles present are younger immigrant singles, couples, and families. The next dominant lifestyle is described as Cluttered Nests. These individuals are labeled as upper-middle class urban couples or families. They have a high ethnic presence as their households are a mix of multigenerational families. Households with children tend to be in their late tends or early twenties (Tetrad Computer Applications, 2011).

CHAPTER 6: COMMERCIAL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS
This study conducted two commercial structure analyses, one for the Shops at Don Mills, and another one for the former Don Mills Shopping Centre using data from the CSCA retailer database, which collects information about each retailer on an annual basis. Both analyses looked at the distance, store atmosphere, store pricing, and the variety of merchandise a retailer had. The Shops at Don Mills commercial structure analysis used data from 2011, and the former Don Mills Shopping Centre used data from 2005, which was a year before Cadillac Fairview announced the construction of the lifestyle centre. Appendix D is an example of how the commercial structure analysis was conducted for both the Shops at Don Mills and Don Mills Shopping Centre. The first category looked at access to each individual store. Access was measured by the distance, in kilometers, from one retailer to its nearest store. Store access was difficult to determine for some of the retailers that were present in the Don Mills Shopping Centre because some of the tenants do not exist anymore or have relocated their store. However, many of the retailers the nearest store was at Fairview Mall, another property owned by Cadillac Fairview, located at Don Mills Road and Sheppard Avenue East. It is assumed that these shorter distances mean that the retailers at the former Don Mills Shopping Centre drew custom from a smaller trading area (i.e., they attracted local users). These findings also suggest that retailers at the former Don Mills Shopping Centre were in a saturated market due to close proximity to similar retailers. The Shops at Don Mills gives off a perception that many of the retailers present are independent and specialized boutiques. However, when determining the distance of each retailer to its nearest store, it was surprising to find that many of these stores at the Shops at Don Mills

41

were chains that were present in Toronto. Many of these retailers are located at either Fairview Mall, or Bayview Village, the nearest regional shopping centres. The remainder of the stores were speciality restaurants that had no sister stores present. These niche independent retailers have a larger trading area, which is more likely to attract people outside of the Don Mills community. Store atmosphere was evaluated based upon features such as the design, ambiance, and overall organization of the retailer. Based upon these criteria, Don Mills Shopping Centre`s store atmosphere were mainly rated low to average. This indicates that the Don Mills Shopping Centre had an issue with store quality as many of the retailers were classified as offering everyday lowpricing. In contrast, the Shops at Don Mills had a high store atmosphere which reflects the high priced goods and services sold at each retailer. The high store atmosphere could also be attributed to the recent opening of the lifestyle centre, but in general, lifestyle centres are comprised of upscale specialty retailers and it should come as no surprise that they exude a high and sophisticated store atmosphere. The next dimension that was looked at was price promotion, which was determined through a combination of store price perceptions, retailer pricing formant, and frequency of price promotion. Due to the time of this study, it was difficult to determine the level of price promotion that occurred for a retailer at the Don Mills Shopping Centre. As a result, store price promotion was based upon existing stores in the area. Store price perceptions are based upon a ranking of 21 using the criteria established in evaluating the category store atmosphere (Baker et al., 2002). Similar to the results from the store atmosphere category, the former Don Mills Shopping Centre had low rankings, with no retailer scoring higher than 12. In contrast, many of the retailers in the Shops at Don Mills had

42

high rankings, with no retailer falling below 18. A higher score indicates that based on store atmosphere qualities, a consumer is very likely to make a purchase at a retailer. Retailer pricing format influences a consumer`s store choice and purchase behaviour. For many of the retailers at the Don Mills Shopping Centre, their retailers were based upon an EDLP (Every Day Low Pricing) format. This particular format indicates that the merchandise sold at each retailer is competitively priced and the main focus is on the type of products sold and not necessary the quality of the product. These products are generally convenience goods and bring consumers in on a frequent basis. In contrast, many of the retailers at the Shops at Don Mills were based upon a HILO (High Low Pricing) format. HILO pricing format tends to entice shoppers to a store due to the frequency of price promotion. For example, many of the retailers at the Shops at Don Mills are high-end stores, which indicate that their pricing format is also high priced. However, when promotions or sales occur at these retailers, this attracts more people to the store who are more inclined to purchase goods knowing that the merchandise prices reflect what they are able to spend. Price promotion is evaluated through the frequency a retailer`s merchandise goes on sale. Similar to the last two categories, the Don Mills Shopping Centre is based upon the existing retailers in the area. Due to the EDLP pricing format, many of the retailers such as Claires and Home Hardware have frequent promotions year-round. However, some retailers do not have any promotions such as Daisy convenience stores as it is believed that they offer convenience goods. Retailers at the Shops at Don Mills varied between very rarely` and occasional` price promotions. Due to the retailer format, when a HILO retailer such as Banana Republic has a promotion going on in their store, consumers are more inclined to visit and make a purchase.

43

The final two dimensions looked at cross-category assortment and within-category assortment, which examines the variety of merchandise sold. These dimensions were based from four-digit NAICS code, data which CSCA collects on an annual basis. From the retailer`s profile, it was determined most if not all of the stores at the Shops at Don Mills had a shallow crosscategory assortment, but had a wide within-category assortment. In other words, the retailers present at the Shops at Don Mills tend to focus on one category, for example, clothing and offered a wide array of clothing types. Don Mills Shopping Centre had a similar result. Although each individual retailer focused on a particular category, as a whole the entire mall offered a wide variety of goods and services sold; whereas the Shops at Don Mills concentrated mainly on women`s attire and services. Appendix G illustrates the range and proportion of retailer type in both shopping centres. Based on the commercial structure analysis for both the Don Mills Shopping Centre and the Shops at Don Mills, different retailers attract certain lifestyle group.

6.1 DEMOGRAPHIC & COMMERCIAL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS
Under the Central Don Mills Secondary Plan (2006a), the southwest quadrant of Don Mills Road and Lawrence Avenue is to function as a community and commercial centre. The former Don Mills Shopping Centre was recognized as a regional shopping centre. The purpose of a regional shopping centre is to serve the local and greater community, by providing goods and services (Urban Land Institute, 1999). By looking at retail composition, the former Don Mills Shopping Centre had a great depth and range of merchandise as shown in Appendix G. Although there was an array of retailers present in the regional mall, it was ultimately not enough to sustain itself as the shopping centre and was redeveloped into a lifestyle centre. During its time, the Don Mills Shopping Centre primarily functioned as a community centre and gathering spot for seniors to

44

take shelter from the harsh weather climates, identified in the community reports from the Don Mills Friends community group (Fioritto, 2006b; Fioritto, 2006a; Benitah, 2006). The Shops at Don Mills is labelled as Canada`s first urban village, but functions as a lifestyle centre. The purpose of a lifestyle centre is to reflect the lifestyles in the area by providing upscale retailers and restaurants in a high quality main street` environment through an open-air concept retail format. Findings from the demographic analysis showed that the majority of the residents in the area are young couples and families who have a modest to above average income, tend to early adopters of trends, and who would be well-suited with a lifestyle centre. The types of retailers from the commercial structure analysis indicate that one third of the retailers are high-end clothing stores, but many of these retailers have a small trading area suggesting that consumers visiting these stores area from the neighbourhood. However, when looking at restaurants and certain retailers such as Anthropologie and Barbuti Fine Men`s Clothing, the distance from one retailer to the next would indicate that consumers are willing to travel further distances to purchase their goods and services. The urban design guidelines for the Don Mills Centre Redevelopment states that the main purpose of the Shops at Don Mills: ...to create an exciting destination for shopping entertainment and employment uses and will provide needs-based shopping and destination shopping... (Cadillac Fairview; Pellow & Associates Architect Inc., 2006, p. 9) Upon review of the policy, retail mix, and demographics of the area, the Shops at Don Mills provides retail needs for a subset of the community. These findings raise several concerns as to whether the planning policies enacted in Don Mills are sufficient to create community` retail functions. A secondary plan is to provide more direction than an official plan in terms of

45

directing growth and development while maintaining and enhancing the character of the neighbourhood. The lifestyle centre at Don Mills supports a proportion of the surrounding neighbourhood, is that merely enough to meet the requirements of planning legislation. Ultimately, can a shopping centre in a major urban market be expected to meet the needs of the entire local community? Aside from the planning policy, the results of the analysis highlight social and equity issues, individuals that could afford to shop at the Don Mills Shopping Centre may not be able to afford goods and services offered at the Shops at Don Mills. These individuals may travel further distances to purchase such goods and services, which goes against Macklin Hancock`s vision of creating a self-sustaining neighbourhood.

CHAPTER 7: CONCLUSIONS
This chapter concludes the efforts of this study and is divided into three sections. First, a summary of the overall study is presented. Second, implications, both academic and applied, are discussed. Finally, this chapter concludes by outlining areas for future research.

7.1 SUMMARY
The overall goal of this study was to determine whether the Shops at Don Mills functions as a commercial and community centre to the surround Don Mills neighbourhood as set out in the Central Don Mills Secondary Plan (2006a). In order to address this issue, three objectives were set out. The first objective looked at whether lifestyle centres are conducive for community and commercial activity. From the literature, a commercial centre is often referred to as a shopping centre where retail activity occurs. A community centre on the other hand does not need to be a public facility; it is described as a gathering spot for local residents, which can include shopping centres, cafes, and local parks. Therefore an area can function both as a commercial and community centre. Lifestyle centres on the other hand are characterized by two main functions: open-air design, and high end retailers and/or services. A lifestyle centre can function as a commercial and community centre if placed in the right location that serves the local residents` needs. The second objective looked at the demographics of the Don Mills community. Using the boundaries of from the Central Don Mills Secondary Plan (2006a), it was determined that the median age of the area is slightly older, but their median household income was significantly higher than rest of the City. In terms of the population, there were two dominant age groups

47

present in Don Mills. The first group was a younger cohort that was primarily made up of couples and small families. The second group was an older cohort that lived around the Shops at Don Mills. The final objective was to look at the Shops at Don Mills and the former Don Mills Shopping Centre to see if their retailers serve Don Mill`s commercial and community needs. In order to compare each shopping centre, a criterion was developed that outlined the level of access, store atmosphere, store pricing, cross-category assortment, and within-category assortment. Both the commercial structure and demographic analysis, along with the policy review indicated that the retailers at the former Don Mills Shopping Centre did service the local population, but seniors tended to go there to socialize, which turned the shopping centre into a community centre for seniors. As a result, this may have impacted how the rest of the community used the shopping centre. Since then the area has evolved. Don Mills has received a significant proportion of adults in the area. As well, there has been an increase in household median income, which may be attributed to the influx of adults in the area. As a result of this, the Shops at Don Mills is catering towards that particular lifestyle. The Shops at Don Mills is a unique retailing experience, offering patrons an open-air environment with upscale retailers and restaurants. The overall design of the centre attempts to integrate itself with the surrounding neighbourhood by instilling the 5 design principles Macklin Hancock established. However, converting the former Don Mills Shopping Centre to the Shops at Don Mills proved to be very contentious and an involved extensive` planning process. Considering these dynamics, the findings from this study suggest that adhering to planning policies is not enough. Although the Shops at Don Mills serves the surrounding community, it

48

only serves a particular group. Planners and developers must respect the local diversity and find new and innovative ways to include all segments of the population.

7.2 IMPLICATIONS
Academic literature on lifestyle centres in North America is limited, particularly with regard to centres in Canada. Therefore, a key objective of this paper is to provide an update on the literature of Canadian lifestyle centres. Through understanding, deconstructing, and analyzing texts, this research attempts to bridge a gap in retail planning literature by classifying and identifying retail structures in the urban landscape. From a planning perspective, it is critical to understand the function of a lifestyle centre by determining the impacts they have on citizens and the broader community. By recognizing the various types of people who frequent this type of retail development, this will allow developers, policy-makers, and planners to make informed decision to efficiently and effectively develop more lifestyle centres within the Toronto area, and elsewhere. In a highly competitive and sophisticated marketplace, developers must design, operate, and construct retail forms that meet the demands of the consumer. Today`s shoppers are looking for more than just convenience. Aside from a variety of retail stores, the shopping environment must allow shoppers to seek meaningful connections, and  respect and inspire their decisions (Urban Land Institute, 2008, p. 131). With these new demands, current retail forms such as shopping centres constructed between 1950s and 1980s need reinvestment and renovations. This will allow shopping centres to remain competitive in an ever-changing marketplace.

49

7.3 FUTURE RESEARCH
The scope of this study was to determine the functions of a commercial and community centre and evaluate whether the Shops at Don Mills met them. Due to the theoretical nature of this study, there is a need to look at a patron`s motivation to shops at the Shops at Don Mills. A consumer survey would be able to demonstrate if the Shops at Don Mills alters people`s behaviour in terms of the way they interact with the built environment as well as the distance a person is willing to travel to visit the retail development. Another area that requires further attention is the evaluation of the Central Don Mills Secondary Plan (2006a). Distilled from an Official Plan, the purpose of a Secondary Plan is to provide objectives and policies that will guide development to fit in with the local context. It is evident that the Shops at Don Mills partially fits in with the surrounding neighbourhood. The retailers in the lifestyle centre cater towards a specific group offering a sense of community and identity. This research raises questions with regards to lifestyle centres functioning as community centres, and whether they are sustainable strategies for achieving healthy, pedestrianfriendly neighbourhoods in the future, or does it encourage automobile-dependency for individuals who cannot afford to shop there.

North York Official Plan: Objective: to preserve the commercial function of the commercial areas while permitting complementary uses that enhance the commercial area and make efficient use of lands. Commercial: provides for a wide range of uses including retail and service commercial uses, office uses, residential uses on upper floors and some institutional uses Sub-Centre: intended for more intensely developed mixed-use areas. Generally characterized by a concentration of residential, retail, service, commercial and offices uses developed at maximum densities generally lower than those permitted in the North York City Centre C.5 Section 2.6.0.: provide the development meets the density policy of the Central Don Mills Secondary Plan C.10: accommodating medium to high density development on sub-centre lands within a Floor Space Index of 1.0 to 3.0. Notwithstanding this general policy, the Plan goes on to states in the case where a Secondary Plan has been adopted, the polices of the Secondary Plan take precedence. Central Don Mills Secondary Plan 1.1 Central Don Mills was planned and built in the 1950`s as a self-contained community. A unique development in its time, it became a model for suburban development across Canada. Although Don Mills changed and evolved, basic elements remained. These are: a) Four discrete neighbourhoods each historically focused on an elementary school and church, built outside a ring road (The Donways); b) Apartment development within the ring road; c) A central commercial and community centre within The Donways at the southwest corner of Don Mills Road and Lawrence Avenue; d) A local road network in the four neighbourhoods designed to discourage through traffic; e) Schools in an open space setting; f) An open space network comprised of parks and walkways that provide pedestrian and cycling links between the neighbourhoods and the community centre; g) A balanced mix of housing forms and tenures, including detached and semi-detached dwellings, townhouses and apartments; h) A sense of scale and consistency in design; i) The arrangement of built form and open spaces in a sympathetic, mutually supportive manner; and j) Design and landscaping reflecting the garden city concept

59

2.1 The general goal of this Secondary Plan is to manage change in the community in a manner that retains and enhances the existing character of the area. In order to achieve this goal, the following are defined as specific objectives of this Secondary Plan. c) To strengthen the function of the Don Mills Centre as a community centre 4.4 Mixed Use Area A` and Mixed Use Area B` (Don Mills Centre) The Don Mills Centre comprises those lands bounded by Lawrence Avenue, Don Mills Road, and The Donway West shown as Mixed Use Area A` and Mixed Use Area B` on Map24-1.

APPENDIX F ­ LIFESTYLE TYPE
Urban Elite ­ The most affluent Canadian households belong to Urban Elite, the social group that ranks at the top of many demographic measures: income, home value and educational achievement. With their university degrees and positions as executives and professionals, these middle-aged and older residents tend to live in fashionable homes and condos in big-city neighbourhoods and close-in suburbs. Befitting their lofty incomes, Urban Elite members are big consumers of gourmet food, expensive clothes, luxury cars, investment products and travel services. Many are culture buffs who attend plays, ballets, operas and concerts all at high rates. They`re also involved in their communities, active in politics and the financial contributors to a variety of causes. Upscale and educated professionals and their families Upscale: $123,359 Older Ethnic Presence: Medium Urban Upscale Ethnic ­ Home to the nation`s youngest residents, Urban Young consists of households where most maintainers are under 40 years old. With many residents just entering the workforce, these university-educated singles and couples earn a range of incomes--from high to lower-middleclass-- from white collar and service sector jobs. But without family obligations, they`re able to rent decent apartments in downtown neighbourhoods and lead a hip, progressive lifestyle. Urban Young residents typically are night owls who frequent bars, cinemas, theatres and art galleries. They`re big on fitness, joining health clubs, playing basketball and doing Pilates. They tend to be early adopters who like to purchase the latest books, music and electronics. And many are community activists who volunteer for social causes and political groups that reflect their typically liberal views.

Urban Upscale Ethnic ­ Geo-centered in Toronto and Montreal, the Urban Upscale Ethnic group consists of four middle- to upper-middle-class clusters with high concentrations of European immigrants--especially those from Italy, Portugal and Greece. Their households are a mix of middleaged and older couples and families, with children in their late teens and twenties. Many residents share an Old World lifestyle, with a third reporting a language other than English or French as their mother tongue. Popular leisure activities include attending operas and ballets, soccer matches and baseball games, as well as film festivals and historical sites. In their urban neighbourhoods, many residents take public transit, but internationally they exhibit high rates for travelling by train and rental car--especially in their home countries across Europe. Upper-middle-class urban couples and multigenerational families Upper-Middle: $88,128 Older Ethnic Presence: High Suburban Midscale ­ Suburban Midscale households are concentrated in the middle- and upper-middle-class suburbs of Canada`s towns, small cities and secondtier metros. Home to a mix of middle-aged and older couples, singles and families, this group has parlayed service sector and white-collar jobs into middle-class incomes. In their detached homes and apartment buildings, they pursue low-stress leisure lifestyles. Residents like to listen to their stereos, watch TV, make crafts and garden. When they go out, they have high rates for frequenting dinner theatres, drivethrough restaurants, home shows and casinos. In their communities outside the nation`s big cities, they`re close enough to the country to enjoy boating, snowmobiling and camping. But this is a group known for its aging characteristics--with mature residents, older homes and used crossover vehicles. Lower-middle-class, suburban apartment-dwelling seniors Lower-Middle: $65,775 Ethnic Presence: Medium

Urban Downscale Ethnic ­ The Urban Downscale Ethnic group consists of households found in gateway communities for new immigrants. Nearly half the residents are visible minorities who have migrated from Asia and the Caribbean, and many are young singles, divorcés and the single parents of young families who arrived in Canada since 1990. Settling in high-rise apartments, these newcomers may have university degrees but only service sector jobs and downscale lifestyles. Still, they have active social lives, enjoying urban amenities like art galleries, bars and film festivals. Many are fitness buffs who enjoy soccer, jogging, Pilates and other aerobic exercise. And they`re frequent shoppers at outlet malls, flea markets and natural foods stores. In their apartments, they relax by going online or reading varied magazines that cover news, computers and fashion. Young, downscale city immigrants Lower-Middle: $55,777 Young Ethnic Presence: High Urban Downscale ­ The least affluent social group, Urban Downscale is a collection of households that are home to mostly young singles living in inexpensive city apartments. Scattered in urban neighbourhoods across the country, the households in these segments include a disproportionate number of recent immigrants, students and single-parent families. As a group, their lifestyle reflects activities of the young and restless: they go to bars, dance clubs, music festivals and comedy clubs. They also like to work out at health clubs, doing Pilates and yoga. With their entry-level service sector and white-collar jobs, there`s not a lot of money for new cars, fine jewellery, boats or exotic travel. But these Canadians enjoy surfing the virtual world and regularly visit sites to buy books and music, read online newspapers and magazines, and search for jobs and dates. Young mobile urban singles and couples Lower-Middle: $55,786 Young Ethnic Presence: Medium

63

Suburban Upscale Ethnic ­ The clusters in Suburban Upscale Ethnic are filled with mostly recent immigrants from China, India, Pakistan and the Philippines. Predominantly upper-middle-class, these younger and middle-aged families commute to white-collar and service sector jobs from an eclectic mix of suburban homes, row houses, duplexes and apartments. Households in this group tend to include children of varying ages who play outdoor sports, own lots of consumer electronics and computer gear, and frequent venues like video arcades and cinemas. Exhibiting average rates for speaking English at home, these residents make a strong market for mainstream media: TV talk shows, fashion magazines, national newspapers and sports radio. They are also enthusiastic shoppers who like to patronize outlet malls, independent fine food stores and online retail sites. Younger, thriving immigrant families Upper-Middle: $79,495 Younger Ethnic Presence: High
