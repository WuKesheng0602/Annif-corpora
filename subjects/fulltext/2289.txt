Abstract Emotion Regulation Difficulties and Psychopathology in Bariatric Surgery Candidates Doctor of Philosophy, 2013 Rachel Strimas Psychology, Ryerson University Evidence suggests high rates of psychiatric disorders in bariatric surgery candidates (e.g., Kalarchian et al., 2007; Mitchell et al., in press), although no rigorous studies have examined the prevalence in a Canadian sample. As such, the first purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of Axis I disorders, and associations with quality of life, in a sample of consecutively referred bariatric surgery candidates at the Toronto Western Hospital Bariatric Surgery Program. In light of emerging evidence linking emotion regulation difficulties with diverse psychiatric symptoms, the second purpose of this study was to examine whether emotion regulation difficulties were common or specific determinants of mood, anxiety, and eating psychodiagnostic categories, as such information would help inform interventions. Three hundred and twenty-one bariatric surgery candidates (80.1% female; M age = 44.37 years) were assessed using a structured psychodiagnostic interview and completed questionnaires of healthrelated quality of life and emotion regulation difficulties. Results indicated that 54.5% of patients met DSM-IV-TR criteria for a lifetime psychiatric diagnosis and 18.4% met criteria for a current psychiatric disorder. Major depressive disorder was the most common lifetime psychiatric disorder and binge eating disorder was the most prevalent current psychiatric disorder. Compared to patients without a current Axis I disorder, participants diagnosed with a current Axis I disorder reported significantly worse functioning on most mental and physical health domains (p's < .01). Overall, a series of regression analyses revealed that difficulties iii

regulating emotions accounted for unique variance in current mood and anxiety disorder status (p's < .001). Difficulties in emotion regulation were not significantly associated with current eating disorder status after Bonferroni correction. Taken together, these results confirm the high rates of psychiatric disorders in a Canadian sample of bariatric surgery candidates and provide evidence for associated functional health impairment. The data also add to the growing body of literature demonstrating emotion regulation difficulties across psychodiagnostic categories and are consistent with suggestions that psychosocial interventions for bariatric patients might benefit from directly targeting difficulties in emotion regulation. Further study of these associations is needed to replicate these findings and elucidate how difficulties in emotion regulation interact with psychopathology to affect patients' post-operative outcomes.

Emotion Regulation and Psychopathology in Bariatric Surgery Candidates Obesity, now of epidemic proportions, has been declared one of the major concerns for global health by the World Health Organization (WHO, 2010a). In 2005, approximately 1.6 billion adults worldwide were overweight and at least 400 million adults were obese (WHO, 2010b). Recent projections indicate that by 2015, 2.3 billion adults will be overweight and 700 million more will be obese (WHO, 2010b). All overweight and obese individuals are at elevated risk of developing chronic and debilitating conditions such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis, and breast, prostate and colon cancer. In addition, the economic burden of obesity is high, with associated costs accounting for 2-6% of health care expenditure in developed countries (WHO, 2010b). Several different methods are used to determine overweight and obesity, including measures of waist circumference, skinfold thickness, and underwater weighing. Due to its ease of use and acceptable approximations of body fat in the population (Micozzi, Albanes, Jones, & Chumlea, 1986), the most popular measure of body mass is the body mass index (BMI), which is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of height in metres (kg/m2). Obesity is commonly defined as a BMI  30 kg/m2 in a classification system where underweight is 18.5 kg/m2, normal weight is 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2, and overweight is 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2 (WHO, 1998; National Institutes of Health [NIH], 1998). The obese category may be further categorized into class 1 obesity, class 2 obesity, and class 3 obesity (see Table 1). The risk of health-related complications increases in a linear fashion with increasing BMI (see McTigue, Harries, Hemphill, Lux, Sutton, Bunton, & Lohr, 2003; WHO, 2010a); thus, as individuals move up obesity subcategories, their risk of developing life-threatening comorbidities increases as well.

Currently, the BMI groups experiencing the most rapid increase in prevalence are within the 35+ and 40+ range (Flegal, Carroll, Ogden, & Johnson, 2002; Sturm, 2003). Table 1 Classification of Weight Status Weight status Underweight Normal weight Overweight Obese (Class I) Obese (Class II) Extreme obesity (Class III) BMI (kg/m2) < 18.5 18.5 ­ 24.9 25.0 ­ 29.9 30.0 ­ 34.9 35.0 ­ 39.9  40

Note. Classifications are defined by the National Institutes of Health (1998).

Surgical Treatment of Obesity Current treatments of obesity include dietary restriction (i.e., low-calorie and very-lowcalorie diets), increased physical activity, pharmacological agents, and surgery (see Taylor, Stonehocker, Steele, & Sharma, 2012). Dietary changes and exercise are often targeted with behavioural interventions that address skills acquisition and motivational issues to help individuals change lifestyle patterns. However, systematic review of dietary and physical activity interventions alone or in combination with other treatments indicates only modest weight 2

loss (3 to 5 kg) over 12 months (McTigue et al., 2003). Maintenance strategies may help to sustain weight loss, but gradual weight regain tends to follow initial weight loss in the absence of sustained adherence to the regimen (Douketis, Feightner, Attia, & Feldman, 1999; McTigue et al., 2003). Therapy with medications (e.g., orlistat) may be indicated for the treatment of obesity or in overweight individuals with comorbid health conditions. Systematic evaluations of various pharmacological agents, however, have found modest weight loss (3 to 5 kg) over 6 months and weight regain after discontinuation of the medication (Arterburn & Noel, 2001; McTigue et al., 2003). In light of the serious health sequelae associated with obesity, and the long-term ineffectiveness of dietary, physical activity and pharamacological weight loss interventions, surgical treatment for obesity, or "bariatric surgery," is now a viable treatment option for obese patients (NIH, 1998). Prospective study of post-operative bariatric patients has demonstrated sustained (> 10 years) and substantial (> 15%) weight loss, reduced mortality rates, and dramatic improvements in quality of life relative to obese controls (Sjöström, 2000; Sjöström, Lissner, Wedel, & Sjöström, 1999; Sjöström et al., 2007). Currently, bariatric surgery is recommended for patients with "clinically severe obesity" as indexed by BMI and related high-risk conditions (NIH Consensus Development Conference Panel, 1991). It is recognized, however, that surgical interventions are considered adjuncts to necessary dietary and activity changes if weight loss is to be sustained. Bariatric surgery candidates are those with a BMI  40 or patients with a BMI  35 with at least one comorbidity associated with obesity, such as obstructive sleep apnea, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or obesity-related physical ailments such as joint disease (NIH Consensus Development Conference Panel, 1991). In addition, candidates for surgery must be motivated, aware of the long-term dietary and lifestyle adaptations, and have had previous ineffective 3

weight loss attempts. Currently, a consensus on absolute contraindications for surgery does not exist. Suggested contraindications include serious uncontrolled psychiatric disorder (e.g., psychosis, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression), active substance abuse or dependence (i.e., cigarettes, recreational drugs, or excessive alcohol consumption), and medical or surgical conditions that elevate operative risk (e.g., severe congestive heart failure). Patients who cannot comprehend or adhere to the lifestyle and dietary changes required post-operatively despite education should also not be recommended for surgery (Mechanick et al., 2008; NIH Consensus Development Conference Panel, 1991). Three broad categories of bariatric surgery procedures exist: 1) restrictive procedures, which limit the stomach's capacity for food; 2) malabsorptive procedures, which interfere with the digestion of food; or 3) a combination of restrictive and malabsorptive procedures (see Table 2). Amongst the currently available surgical options, the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the most widely performed bariatric operation in North America due to its low mortality, significant weight loss, and reduction in obesity-related comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and sleep apnea (Buchwald, Avidor, Braunwald, Jensen, Pories, Fahrbach, & Schoelles, 2004; Picot, Jones, Colquitt, Gospodarevskaya, Loveman, Baxter, & Clegg, 2009; Sjöström et al., 2007). In this procedure, the upper part of the stomach is transacted producing a small stomach pouch that restricts food intake to 10 to 30 mL. The gastric pouch is attached to a section of the small intestine, the jejunum, allowing food to bypass a large portion of the stomach, duodenum, and proximal jejunum. These modifications drastically restrict the size of the stomach, delay gastric emptying, and limit the absorption of calories, which together result in significant weight loss.

The RYGB has been shown to produce significant and durable weight loss in various controlled studies. In the Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study, in which bariatric surgery patients and non-surgical obese controls were followed for an average of 10.9 years postoperatively, Sjöström and colleagues (2007) reported a mean absolute weight change of ±2% in the non-surgical obese controls versus a maximum weight loss of 20% in banding patients, 25% in vertical banded gastroplasty, and 32% in gastric bypass patients. Ten years post-operatively, the absolute weight loss in the surgical groups stabilized at 14%, 16%, and 25%, respectively. A recent review found that the RYGB procedure consistently demonstrated a superior and clinically significant difference in weight loss, and resolution of obesity-related comorbidities, relative to the laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding procedure, which is the most common bariatric surgery in Europe and Australia (Tice, Karliner, Walsh, Petersen, Feldman, 2008). 5

Indeed, most patients undergoing the RYGB experienced complete resolution of their diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and hypertension (Buchwald et al., 2004; Salehi, Prigeon, & D'Alessio, 2011; Tice et al., 2008). It is also common for reports to detail weight loss results in terms of mean percentage of excess weight loss, which is calculated as total weight loss / excess weight loss × 100, where excess weight = total pre-operative weight - ideal weight. Data from a recent meta-analysis comparing post-operative weight loss found significantly greater excess weight loss for the RYGB procedure than the laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding procedure at 1 year post-surgery (61.5% vs. 42.6%), 2 years post-surgery (69.7% vs. 50.3%), and >3 years postsurgery (71.2% vs. 55.2%; Garb, Welch, Zagarins, Kuhn, & Romanelli, 2009). Composite estimates of percent excess weight loss were approximately 63% for the RYGB versus 49% for the laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding procedure (Garb et al., 2009), which are similar to values reported by Buchwald and colleagues (2004) in an earlier systematic review and metaanalysis. Thus, patients who underwent RYGB surgery had greater sustained weight loss relative to patients who had gastric banding. The RYGB is, however, associated with more nutritional deficiencies due to the malabsorptive component, and strict adherence to the postoperative dietary regimen and vitamin supplementation is essential to ward off nutritional complications (Ledoux et al., 2006). Nevertheless, these dramatic improvements in obesity comorbidities, substantial and prolonged weight loss, and the low rate of complications and mortality, make the RYGB procedure the "gold standard" for bariatric surgery. Psychiatric Disorders in Bariatric Surgery Candidates Despite the benefits of bariatric surgery, and RYGB in particular, as many as 20% of patients fail to lose a significant amount of weight (Sugerman et al., 1989), which has been attributed to psychosocial factors that may affect patients' ability to adapt and adhere to the post6

operative lifestyle changes (Hsu et al., 1998). For instance, a recent review examined psychosocial predictors of post-operative weight loss following RYGB and found that lifetime or current Axis I psychiatric disorders, particularly disorders of mood and anxiety, were important predictors of reduced weight loss after surgery (Sockalingam, Hawa, Wnuk, Strimas, & Kennedy, 2011). In addition, Sockalingam and colleagues (2011) reported that post-operative loss of control over eating, a component of binge eating, was correlated with weight regain following RYGB. It is perhaps not surprising that patients with past or present mood or anxiety disorders exhibit less weight loss after surgery as a substantial body of evidence has linked emotional eating with negative affective states, suggesting that some individuals may eat in attempt to provide temporary comfort or distraction from unpleasant emotions (see Polivy & Herman, 1993 and Heatherton & Baumeister, 1991 for reviews; Stice, 2001; Waller, 2000). In addition, symptoms of depression and anxiety may indirectly affect food intake by impinging upon the patient's ability to adhere to lifelong changes in dietary habits. Aside from the effects of psychopathology on post-operative weight loss, psychiatric comorbidity predicts worse quality of life in bariatric surgery samples (Kalarchian et al., 2007; Mauri et al., 2008), suggesting that poor mental health also impairs psychosocial and functional status in this group. Owing to the effect of psychiatric morbidity on post-operative outcomes, most bariatric surgery programs require patients to have a pre-operative mental health assessment (Bauchowitz et al., 2005; Devlin, Goldfein, Flancbaum, Bessler, & Eisenstadt, 2004; Santry, Chin, Cagney, Alverdy, & Lauderdale, 2006). This requirement has been articulated by the NIH (1991) who advised that surgical candidates be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team that includes psychiatric expertise. Due to methodological differences in study purpose and diagnostic

7

measures, however, the prevalence1 of psychiatric disorders in bariatric surgery candidates is not fully understood. For instance, Kinzl, Schrattenecker, Traweger, Mattesich, Fiala, and Biebl (2006) used a semi-structured diagnostic interview to assess the pre-operative psychiatric status of 140 female patients and found that 32% of the sample met diagnostic criteria for one psychiatric disorder. However, because the primary purpose of this study was to examine predictors of post-surgical weight loss, Kinzl and colleagues (2006) only provided a global estimate of having any psychiatric disorder and did not report prevalence estimates for specific psychiatric disorders. Other studies have used questionnaires and informal interview methods to estimate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders. For instance, in 294 bariatric surgery candidates, Rosik (2005) used the Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaires (PDSQ) to assess 13 DSM-IV Axis I disorders (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [4th ed.], text revision; American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000). Based on this questionnaire, the authors found that approximately 50% of patients endorsed criteria that suggests an Axis I disorder, with somatization (30%), social phobia (18%), hypochondriasis (15%), and obsessivecompulsive disorder (14%) diagnosed most frequently. In another study, 90 bariatric surgery candidates completed a battery of questionnaires that assessed binge eating, eating disorders, and depressive symptoms (Sarwer et al., 2004). A psychologist then reviewed the patients' responses and completed a supplementary in-person assessment. Overall, 62% of patients had at least one

Prevalence refers to the number of individuals with a given condition (e.g., a psychiatric disorder) in a sample. It is calculated by dividing the number of people who have the condition by the total number of people studied and expressed as a percentage. "Point prevalence" (often simply termed "prevalence") refers to the proportion of the population that has the condition at a specified point in time, often the time of study (e.g., "current prevalence"). "Lifetime prevalence" refers to the proportion of the sample that have had the condition at some point in their life, up to the time of the assessment. Prevalence should be distinguished from incidence, which refers to the rate of occurrence of new cases of disorder in a population rather than the total number of cases of disorder in a population (Kraemer, Kazdin, Offord, Kessler, Jensen, & Kupfer, 1997).

current diagnosis: 31% had major depressive disorder, 27% had binge eating disorder, and 17% had substance abuse or dependence in sustained full remission. As Bocchieri, Meana, and Fisher (2002) aptly note in their review, in the early phases of a field of study it is common to use assorted assessment measures as research questions are developed and assessment procedures are refined. When studying the prevalence of psychiatric disorders, however, the trouble in relying upon self-report questionnaires is possible over- and underreporting of symptoms, which compromises the validity and reliability of the diagnosis. Accurate classification of psychological symptoms can be challenging in a group of morbidly obese patients as their physical health symptoms can confound with psychiatric symptoms (e.g., lack of energy, sleep difficulty, hyperphagia). In contrast, administration of a diagnostic interview allows an experienced interviewer to probe the patient's responses to see whether his or her symptoms are attributable to medical or psychiatric conditions. To better understand the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in bariatric surgery candidates, recent studies have used DSM-IV criteria and standardized diagnostic interviews. Rosenberger, Henderson, and Grilo (2006) assessed 147 pre-surgical RYGB patients in the United States and found that 37% of patients had at least one lifetime Axis I disorder. Lifetime mood, anxiety, eating or substance use disorder was diagnosed in 22%, 16%, 14% and 5% of patients, respectively. Twenty-four percent of participants reported a current Axis I disorder, with mood, anxiety, and eating disorders diagnosed in 11%, 12%, and 10% of patients, respectively. Fewer than 1% of patients reported a current substance use disorder. In a study conducted in Italy, Mauri and colleagues (2008) examined estimates of psychiatric disorders in 282 RYGB candidates and found that 38% reported a lifetime Axis I disorder and 21% reported a current Axis I disorder. In this study, a lifetime mood disorder was most common (22%), followed by 9

anxiety disorder (18%), eating disorder (13%), and substance use disorder (1%). Current anxiety, eating, and mood disorders were diagnosed in 12%, 7%, and 6% of patients, respectively. Substance use disorders were not diagnosed in any surgical candidates. Kalarchian and colleagues (2007) assessed 288 bariatric surgery candidates in the United States and found that 66% of patients met diagnostic criteria for a lifetime Axis I disorder: a lifetime mood disorder was most prevalent (46%), followed by diagnoses of anxiety (38%), substance use (33%), and eating (30%) disorders. Current mood, anxiety, substance use, and eating disorders were reported in 16%, 24%, 2%, and 16% of patients. Finally, in 146 bariatric surgery candidates residing in Germany, Mühlhans, Horbach, and de Zwaan (2009) found that 72% of patients met diagnostic criteria for at least one lifetime disorder, with mood, eating, anxiety, and substance use disorders diagnosed in 55%, 50%, 21%, and 15%, respectively. Fifty six percent of patients reported at least one current psychiatric disorder with eating disorders diagnosed most frequently (38%), followed by mood (32%), anxiety (15%), and substance use disorders (1%). Overall, most of these studies found elevated rates of psychiatric disorders in bariatric surgery candidates relative to general population norms (Kalarchian et al., 2007; Mauri et al., 2008; Mühlhans et al., 2009). Thus, in these studies, when prevalence rates were based upon standardized, semistructured interviews and DSM-IV criteria, estimates of lifetime and current Axis I disorders ranged from 37-73% and 24-56%, respectively. Amongst the reviewed studies, mood disorders ­ and major depressive disorder in particular ­ were consistently diagnosed as the most common lifetime disorder, with estimates ranging from 22 to 55%. With the exception of Mühlhans and colleagues (2009), who reported that eating disorders were the most common current diagnosis, anxiety disorders were most prevalent, with estimates ranging from 12 to 24% of patients. The 10

single most common psychiatric disorders at the time of pre-operative assessment were major depressive disorder (Mühlhans et al. 2009), binge eating disorder (Kalarchian et al., 2007; Mauri et al., 2008), and eating disorder not otherwise specified, excluding diagnoses of binge eating disorder (Rosenberger et al., 2006). The implications of these findings are twofold. Firstly, these studies included large sample sizes, standardized diagnostic assessments, and DSM-IV criteria, yet there was considerable variation in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders. Interestingly, the discrepancy among prevalence estimates narrows when the timing of the evaluation is considered (see Tables 3 and 4). Specifically, when psychiatric assessments were conducted separately from the pre-surgical screening process, the lifetime prevalence of Axis I disorders ranged from 72 to 83% and the current prevalence of psychiatric disorders ranged from 38 to 56% (Kalarchian et al., 2007; Mühlhans et al., 2009). On the other hand, when psychiatric assessments were conducted as part of the pre-surgical screening process, the prevalence estimates narrow considerably. Specifically, the lifetime prevalence of Axis I disorders ranged from 37 to 38%, and the current prevalence of Axis I disorders ranged from 21 to 24% (Mauri et al., 2008; Rosenberger et al., 2006). This suggests that patients report less psychopathology when the assessment is conducted in conjunction with the pre-surgical evaluation, indicating that patients may minimize their symptoms in an attempt to appear suitable for surgery. A second explanation for the discrepancy in these investigations may originate from the study sample. In fact, cross-study comparisons of prevalence rates may be misleading due to sample-based differences in sociodemographics. For instance, patients residing in the United States have various payment methods for healthcare, including Medicaid or Medicare, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, public aid, or private insurance coverage (e.g., see Black, Goldstein, & 11

Mason, 1992; Rosik, 2005). Because patients without healthcare funding or insurance would presumably be ineligible for bariatric surgery, those who qualify for surgery may reflect a unique socioeconomic group. Mühlhans and colleagues (2009) note that healthcare insurance is more common among German citizens compared to US citizens. In contrast, healthcare in Canada is publically funded and costs are generally paid through funding from income taxes, thereby ensuring that all citizens receive the same care. Private insurance and "out of pocket" payments are a very minimal part of the overall healthcare system in Canada. Thus, regardless of socioeconomic status, providing the patient is deemed eligible for surgery by the multidisciplinary team and can afford the necessary pre- and post-operative nutritional supplements, patients living in Canada can qualify as bariatric surgery patients. In turn, there should be no confound between lower socioeconomic status and psychiatric diagnosis present in Canadian data. Further investigations that study different populations are therefore required. In particular, there is a need to examine the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in a Canadian sample of bariatric surgery patients, which, in a publically funded health care system, may be comprised of patients who differ in sociodemographics.

Emotion Regulation and Psychopathology in Bariatric Surgery Candidates In light of the increasing popularity of bariatric surgery and high, albeit inconsistent, rates of psychiatric co-morbidity that may affect weight loss and quality of life, early identification and management of psychiatric morbidity is essential to maximize patients' post-operative success. Although past or present psychiatric disorders are not contraindications for bariatric surgery per se, it has been suggested that pre-operative treatment and post-operative support be provided to optimally prepare patients for surgery and enhance the likelihood of long-term success (Kalarchian et al., 2007; Mauri et al., 2008). Given the range of psychopathologies reported amongst bariatric patients, the challenge, of course, is to appropriately identity the individuals who would benefit from support and to provide an efficacious, timely, and costeffective intervention. Interestingly, recent conceptualizations of diverse psychiatric disorders underscore their commonalities rather than their differences, with increasing emphasis being placed on emotion regulation as a feature that different psychiatric disorders may share (e.g., Barlow, Allen, & Choate, 2004; Fairburn, 2008). Theorists who study eating behaviour posit that individuals who engage in disordered eating may be predisposed to emotions that are more intense and longerlasting, which are more difficult to regulate (Lavender & Anderson, 2010; Whiteside, Chen, Neighbors, Hunter, Lo, & Larimer, 2007). These individuals may therefore rely on problematic emotion regulation strategies, such as binge eating, because more adaptive strategies are not used or are not sufficiently effective. In the case of mood and anxiety disorders, difficulty regulating emotions is so paramount that these disorders are largely defined by disturbance in emotions (Gross & Muñoz, 1995; Mineka & Sutton, 1992). Causal models of these so-called "distress disorders" (Watson, 2005) suggest that individuals who cannot adaptively regulate their 15

emotions are susceptible to longer and more intense emotional experiences, which may develop into diagnosable depression or anxiety (e.g., Campbell-Sills & Barlow, 2006; Mennin, Holoway, Fresco, Moore, & Heimberg, 2007; Nolen-Hoeksema, Wisco, & Lyubomirsky, 2008). Accordingly, components of emotion regulation have been incorporated into various clinical interventions, including dialectical behaviour therapy (Linehan, 1993; Wiser & Telch, 1999), cognitive behaviour therapy (Barlow, Allen, & Choate, 2004; Fairburn, 2008), and mindfulnessbased therapies (Segal, Williams, & Teasdale, 2002). Emotion and Emotion Regulation. Myriad definitions of emotion and emotion regulation exist and a consensus is lacking on the best conceptualizations. It is therefore critical to clearly operationalize these terms before studying these constructs. Given the complexity in defining emotion, one widely used conceptual framework aims to explicate the typical features of an emotional response (Gross, 1998; Gross & Thompson, 2007), which has been summarized by Werner and Gross (2010). Briefly, one characteristic of emotion is its trigger, which can be categorized as internal (e.g., anticipating a presentation) or external (e.g., watching a scary movie). Next, the trigger is attended to and appraised by the individual, which in turn generates an emotional, physiological, and/or behavioural response (e.g., anxiety, heart racing, leaving a situation). Gross and Thompson's (2007) model also underscores the importance of emotions being "recursive;" that is, the emotion often changes the situation that prompted the response (see Werner & Gross, 2010). Finally, as conceptualized by Gross (1998) and Gross and Thompson (2007), emotions are malleable; that is, emotions must compete with, and can be superseded by, co-occurring responses to the situation (Werner & Gross, 2010). Although emotions serve several important functions (Keltner & Gross, 1999), emotions can be problematic when they are contextually insensitive, are too intense, or last too long 16

(Werner & Gross, 2010). The notion that emotions can be maladaptive introduces the concept of emotion regulation. Likely owing to the absence of an agreed-upon conceptualization of emotion regulation, however, this construct has been studied in a multitude of ways. Some researchers use an assortment of measures (e.g., measures of affective control, emotional response tendencies, emotional intelligence) that are theoretically related to emotion regulation in attempt to capture this construct (e.g., see Mennin et al., 2007). The Negative Mood Regulation Scale (NMR; Catanzaro & Mearns, 1990) and the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS; Salovey, Mayer, Goldman, Turvey, & Palfai, 1995) are self-report measures of emotion regulation. However, the NMR fails to assess the context in which the regulation strategies were used and the TMMS does not measure the ability to engage in goal-directed behaviour when experiencing distress, which is a pertinent component of emotion regulation (Gratz & Roemer, 2004). In an attempt to address these limitations, Gratz and Roemer (2004) developed a comprehensive, integrative measure of difficulties in emotion regulation, called the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). As the name suggests, this self-report measure captures "difficulties" regulating emotions, which is particularly useful when studying psychiatric disorders as researchers seek to understand variables that contribute to the onset and maintenance of psychopathology. Gratz and Roemer's (2004) conceptualization of emotion regulation, and the viewpoint that will be used in this paper, emphasizes the functional nature of emotional responses, with difficulties in emotion regulation defined as "maladaptive emotional responses or difficulties acting effectively in the context of emotionally salient events" (see Tull & Gratz, 2008, p. 200). Specifically, Gratz and Roemer (2004) conceptualize emotion regulation as involving: "(a) awareness and understanding of emotions, (b) acceptance of emotions, (c) ability to control impulsive behaviours and behave in accordance with desired goals when experiencing 17

negative emotions, and (d) ability to use situationally appropriate emotion regulation strategies flexibly to modulate emotional responses as desired in order to meet individual goals and situational demands" (pp. 42-43). Notably, the ability to use these strategies to regulate emotions is adaptive in many ways. In psychopathology, however, ineffective emotion regulation may occur if these strategies are implemented in an overly rigid, inflexible, contextinsensitive fashion that is incongruent with one's long-term goals and values. Emotion Regulation and Psychopathology. Recent evidence supports the theoretical contention that emotion regulation difficulties are associated with eating-related psychopathology. Briefly, in a sample of 695 male and female undergraduate students, Whiteside and colleagues (2007) found that difficulties regulating emotions predicted approximately 6% of the variance in binge eating, as measured by the Eating Disorders Diagnostic Scale (Stice, Telch, & Rizvi, 2000), after controlling for participants' sex, dietary restriction, and over-evaluation of weight and shape. Further analysis indicated that limited access to emotion regulation strategies and lack of emotional clarity uniquely predicted more binge eating (Whiteside et al., 2009), suggesting that binge eaters may have fewer strategies to interpret, modulate, or tolerate emotions. In a sample of 296 undergraduate males, Lavender and Anderson (2010) found that difficulties in emotion regulation significantly contributed to body dissatisfaction and disordered eating, as measured by the Eating Disorder ExaminationQuestionnaire (Fairburn & Bèglin, 1994), above and beyond the variance accounted for by negative affect and BMI. Further analyses indicated that nonacceptance of emotional responses and limited access to emotion regulation strategies uniquely predicted body dissatisfaction, and limited access to emotion regulation strategies uniquely predicted disordered eating.

18

As would be hypothesized, patients with eating disorders exhibit significantly higher scores on the DERS, indicating poorer emotion regulation, relative to non-eating disordered individuals (Harrison, Sullivan, Tchanturia, & Treasure, 2010). A comparison of descriptive statistics shows that those with anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa exhibit the greatest difficulty regulating emotions (median DERS = 127), followed by those with eating disorder symptoms (M = 96.19, SD = 24.96; Whiteside et al., 2007), followed by healthy females (M = 78.88, SD = 18.20; Whiteside et al., 2007) and healthy males (M = 76.72, SD = 19.22; Anderson & Lavender, 2010). Together, these reports suggest that emotion regulation difficulties are associated with disordered eating behaviour in males and females, and in clinical and non-clinical samples. Recent studies have also provided evidence for associations between emotion regulation difficulties and anxiety. In 325 undergraduate students, Salters-Pedneault, Roemer, Tull, Rucker, and Mennin (2006) tested the hypothesis that self-reported worry, the core feature of generalized anxiety disorder, would be associated with emotion regulation difficulties. Participants self-reported their worry and the Generalized Anxiety Disorders Questionnaire (GAD-Q-IV; Newman, Zuellig, & Kachin, 2002) was used to assess DSM-IV criteria for generalized anxiety disorder. As hypothesized, with the exception of the awareness subscale, self-reported worry was significantly associated with the DERS total and subscale scores. These relationships remained significant when the variance contributed by negative affectivity was accounted for. In addition, individuals who met GAD-Q-IV criteria for generalized anxiety disorder diagnoses had significantly more difficulties regulating emotions relative to those without an analogue generalized anxiety disorder diagnosis (M = 94.81, SD = 22.96 versus M = 78.22, SD = 22.00). Again, these associations persisted after negative affectivity was added as a covariate. Recently, Suveg, Morelen, Brewer, and Thomassin (2010) found that greater emotion 19

regulation difficulties predicted higher anxiety, as measured by the Anxiety Subscale of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (Derogatis, 1994). Further examination using path analyses found that difficulties regulating emotions played a mediating role between both temperamental (i.e., behavioural inhibition) and environmental factors (i.e., family emotional environment, family interactions) and anxiety symptoms, suggesting that difficulties regulating emotions may contribute to the development or maintenance of anxiety symptoms. Together, these findings support the relation between emotion regulation difficulties and anxiety symptoms. There is also evidence that depression is associated with self-reported emotion regulation difficulties. Ehring, Fischer, Schnülle, Bösterling, and Tuschen-Caffier (2008) compared 42 `recovered depressed' participants to 42 `never depressed' controls and found that the `recovered depressed' participants reported significantly higher scores on the limited access to emotion regulation strategies, difficulties engaging in goal-directed behaviour, and acceptance subscales of the DERS, which remained significant after controlling for negative mood. In regression analyses predicting the presence or absence of past depression, the only DERS variable to emerge as a significant predictor was difficulties engaging in goal-directed behaviour. A subsequent study by Tull and Gratz (2008) found that difficulties engaging in goal-directed behaviour mediated the relationship between anxiety sensitivity and depression symptom severity. The authors suggest that individuals vulnerable to depression may misinterpret features of anxiety sensitivity (e.g., poor concentration) as indicators of an impending depressive state, which further increases distress and anxiety. Increased distress, in turn, may limit an individual's ability to engage in goal-directed behaviour, thereby decreasing exposure to positively reinforcing behaviours, which increases risk of depression. Finally, Weinberg and Klonsky (2009) examined difficulties regulating emotions in 428 participants and found that the 20

DERS total score exhibited significant correlations with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. Symptoms of depression showed the highest correlations with the DERS (r = .65, p < .001), followed by symptoms of anxiety (r = .42, p < .001), and eating disorders (r = .38, p < .001). Notably, with the exception of the awareness subscale, which exhibited a small correlation with eating disorder symptoms (r = .13, p < .05), all DERS subscales were highly correlated with depression, anxiety, and eating disorder symptoms (p < .001), supporting the notion that broad deficits in emotion regulation are seen amongst different psychiatric disorders. Summary In light of unanimous support linking emotion regulation difficulties with eating, anxiety, and mood psychopathologies, difficulties in emotion regulation have been incorporated into models of specific psychopathologies, including major depressive disorder (e.g., Campbell-Sills & Barlow, 2006; Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2008), generalized anxiety disorder (e.g., Mennin et al., 2007; Suveg et al., 2010), and eating disorders (e.g., Fairburn et al., 1995; McCarthy, 1990; Polivy & Herman, 2002). Providing the emotion regulation construct is operationalized and measured in the same way, viewing psychiatric disorders within an emotion regulation framework is valuable in that it helps to delineate common mechanisms across psychiatric disorders. This work has been termed "transdiagnostic" and is appealing in that any features found to be common across diverse symptom presentations may be treated using common strategies (Mansell, Harvey, Watkins, & Shafran, 2009). In turn, patients with varying symptomatology could theoretically be treated using the same protocol (Wilamowska, Thompson-Hollands, Fairholme, Ellard, Farchione, & Barlow 2010). Ultimately, further understanding of emotion regulation difficulties in bariatric surgery patients will help to inform

21

interventions aimed at the treatment of psychopathology, which may improve weight loss and psychosocial outcomes. Purpose The first purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of current and lifetime psychiatric disorders in a sample of Canadian bariatric surgery candidates. As an indicator of clinical significance, associations between psychiatric status and quality of life were assessed. It was hypothesized that bariatric surgery candidates would report significantly worse healthrelated quality of life than Canadian adult females and males and that patients with a current psychiatric disorder would report significantly worse health-related quality of life than patients without a current psychiatric disorder. The present study addressed previous methodological limitations by recruiting a large sample of consecutively referred bariatric surgery candidates and using a structured diagnostic interview and DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria. The psychological assessment was described as a "routine" component of the pre-operative assessment with the purpose of facilitating the patients' preparedness for surgery. In attempt to increase the accuracy of their self-report, patients were encouraged to respond openly and honestly. The second purpose of this study was to evaluate associations between difficulties in emotion regulation and psychopathology in bariatric surgery candidates. Specifically, we sought to delineate common and specific emotion regulation difficulties across mood, anxiety, and eating psychodiagnostic categories. These associations were investigated in several ways. First, we examined whether bariatric surgery patients as a group were characterized by difficulties in emotion regulation by comparing their total and subscale scores on the DERS to published nonclinical values. Next, given the well-documented gender differences in adults pursuing bariatric surgery (see Tables 3 and 4) and mixed evidence on whether gender is associated with emotion 22

regulation (Gratz & Roemer, 2004), total and subscale scores on the DERS were compared for females and males. Based on preliminary associations documented by Gratz and Roemer (2004), it was hypothesized that emotion regulation difficulties would not be significantly associated with gender. Next, in bivariate and multivariate analyses, we compared the six dimensions of difficulties in emotion regulation captured by the DERS subscale scores in patients with and without a current2 mood, anxiety, or eating disorder, respectively, as assessed by psychodiagnostic interview. It was hypothesized that participants with a current Axis I psychiatric disorder would report greater difficulties in emotion regulation across multiple domains relative to bariatric surgery candidates without a current psychiatric disorder. We further hypothesized that these difficulties in emotion regulation would persist when other psychiatric disorders were controlled for statistically. Finally, in multivariate analysis, we examined whether difficulties in emotion regulation predicted Axis I psychiatric comorbidity with the hypothesis that the DERS subscales would be positively associated with the total number of current Axis I disorders.

2

The DERS assesses current difficulties in emotion regulation only. Because difficulties in emotion regulation may change over time (e.g., with age, psychiatric treatment, psychotherapy), an individual's current ability to regulate his or her emotions may or may not reflect past status (i.e., depending upon whether emotion regulation has improved, deteriorated, or stayed the same over time). As such, associations between emotion regulation difficulties and diagnostic status were assessed with respect to current psychiatric disorder status only.

Method Participants Three hundred twenty one consecutively referred candidates for the RYGB surgery at the Toronto Western Hospital (TWH) Bariatric Surgery Program participated in this study. All participants provided written informed consent between June 2010 and January 2012. Six participants declined to have their questionnaire and psychosocial interview data included in the research study. Participants were mostly female (80.1%) and had a mean age of 44.37 years and mean BMI of 49.59 kg/m2 (detailed description of sample to follow). In accordance with the NIH Consensus Development Conference Panel's recommendations (1991), to be eligible for surgery, patients must have a BMI > 40 kg/m2, or  35 kg/m2 with at least one obesity-related comorbidity such as diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, or hypertension. As part of the assessment process, patients referred to the TWH Bariatric Surgery Program were evaluated by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals. Patients first attended an educational group ("orientation class") focusing on the RYGB procedure. As part of their usual care, patients also completed a psychosocial self-report questionnaire package. Next, patients were scheduled for individual assessments with a nurse practitioner, social worker, dietician, and a psychometrist, psychologist or psychiatrist, in turn. Prior to the dietician's assessment, each patient completed a second educational group focusing on nutrition. Surgical candidates who chose to proceed with the pre-surgical assessment process after attending the orientation class, and provided written informed consent to have their interview and self-report data used for research purposes, were included in the study. This study was approved by the institutional Research Ethics Board at Ryerson University and the University Health Network in Toronto, Canada.

Measures Psychodiagnostic interview. The M.I.N.I. International Neuropsychiatric Interview for ADHD Studies version 6.0 (M.I.N.I. 6.0; Sheehan et al., 1998) is a diagnostic interview that assesses current and lifetime DSM-IV-TR Axis I disorders. Assessors were psychometrists with master's-level training in psychology, psychologists, or psychiatrists. All members of the psychology team received instruction on administration of the M.I.N.I. and psychometrists received weekly supervision from a registered clinical psychologist. The following Axis I psychiatric disorders were assessed: mood (including major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, and bipolar I and II disorders), anxiety (including panic disorder with and without agoraphobia, agoraphobia without history of panic disorder, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder), substance use (including alcohol and other drug abuse and dependence disorders), eating (including bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa), psychotic disorders (including schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Given the propensity of bariatric patients to display binge eating, the M.I.N.I. was supplemented with a module to specifically assess DSM-IV-TR symptoms of binge eating disorder. Notably, although the DSM-IV-TR eating disorder not otherwise specified diagnosis subsumes a diagnosis of binge eating disorder, we elected to report the prevalence of binge eating disorder independently to demonstrate the number of participants who met full diagnostic criteria for this disorder (see Appendix A for DSM-IV-TR suggested research criteria). "Subsyndromal" symptoms of binge eating disorder (e.g., binge eating behaviour or other aspects of binge eating disorder not meeting full diagnostic criteria) that caused significant distress or impairment were diagnosed as eating disorder not otherwise specified. In addition, information regarding clinical presentation (i.e., the frequency 25

and duration of psychiatric symptoms, and associated distress and interference) of the aforementioned diagnostic classes was used to diagnose adjustment disorders, and mood, anxiety, eating, and psychotic disorders not otherwise specified. The M.I.N.I. has previously demonstrated acceptable interrater reliability (all kappa values > 0.75; Sheehan et al., 1998). The M.I.N.I. has also demonstrated good diagnostic validity, with all kappa values exceeding 0.50 except for current drug dependence, which was 0.43 (Sheehan et al., 1998). The M.I.N.I. was used to assess whether patients met diagnostic criteria for a current or lifetime psychiatric disorder. "Current" was defined according to DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria (see Table 5 for timelines of symptoms). A "lifetime" diagnosis was assigned if the patient had ever met diagnostic criteria for the disorder. We did not assess for past generalized anxiety disorder due to the difficulty in assessing this disorder retrospectively.

Emotion regulation. The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz & Roemer, 2004) is a 36-item measure that assesses global and specific difficulties in emotion regulation. The Nonacceptance of Emotional Responses subscale (NONACCEPTANCE; 6 items) reflects the tendency to have negative secondary emotional reactions (e.g., guilt, shame, embarrassment) to one's negative emotions, or nonacceptance of one's emotional distress. A sample item from the NONACCEPTANCE subscale is, "When I'm upset, I feel guilty for feeling that way." The Difficulties Engaging in Goal-Directed Behaviour subscale (GOALS; 5 items) reflects difficulties engaging in goal-directed behaviour when experiencing negative emotions and contains items like, "When I'm upset, I have difficulty getting work done." The Impulse Control Difficulties subscale (IMPULSE; 6 items) reflects difficulties controlling one's behaviour when experiencing negative emotions. A sample item from the IMPULSE subscale is "When I'm upset, I become out of control." The Lack of Emotional Awareness subscale (AWARENESS; 6 items) reflects difficulties attending to and acknowledging emotions and includes items like, "I pay attention to how I feel" (reverse scored). The Limited Access to Emotion Regulation Strategies subscale (STRATEGIES; 8 items) reflects access to emotion regulation strategies perceived as effective. A sample item from this subscale is, "When I'm upset, I believe that there is nothing I can do to make myself feel better." Finally, the Lack of Emotion Clarity subscale (CLARITY; 5 items) reflects how well an individual understands the emotions he or she is experiencing. A sample item from the CLARITY subscale is, "I have difficulty making sense out of my feelings." On each of the 36 items, participants are asked to rate their responses from 1 (almost never; 0-10%) to 5 (almost always; 91-100%). Responses are coded so that higher scores on each subscale indicate greater difficulties with emotion regulation (i.e., greater emotion dysregulation). The DERS has previously demonstrated acceptable internal 28

consistency (Cronbach's  = .93 for the DERS total score; Cronbach's  > .80 for each subscale; Gratz & Roemer, 2004) and construct validity (Gratz & Roemer, 2004). In the present study, Cronbach's  exceeded .70 for the DERS total score ( = .93) and NONACCEPTANCE ( = .90), GOALS ( = .82), IMPULSE ( = .84), AWARENESS ( = .83), STRATEGIES ( = .89), and CLARITY ( = .77) subscale scores, demonstrating appropriate internal reliability (Kline, 1999). Quality of life. The Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF36; Ware & Sherbourne, 1992) is a 36-item self-report questionnaire that assesses health-related quality of life. Scoring of the SF-36 generates eight subscales: four subscales represent the physical health domain (physical functioning, role limitations because of physical health problems, bodily pain, and general health perceptions) and four represent the mental health domain (role limitations because of emotional problems, vitality [energy/fatigue], general mental health [psychological distress and psychological well-being], and social functioning). Composites of the four physical health domains and four mental health domains may be used to generate the physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS). Responses are coded so that higher scores indicate better health status. The SF-36 has well-established reliability (e.g., Cronbach's  > .81 for each scale; Stewart, Hays, & Ware, 1998) and validity, as evidenced by significant correlations with medical and psychiatric symptoms (McHorney, Ware, & Raczek, 1993). In the present study, all eight subscales demonstrated acceptable internal reliability: physical functioning ( = .89), role limitations because of physical health problems ( = .87), bodily pain ( = .80), general health perceptions ( = .73), role limitations because of emotional problems ( = .86), vitality ( = .78), general mental health ( = .84), and social functioning ( = .78). 29

Body Mass Index. Body Mass Index was calculated from measures of height and weight that were collected by a bariatric dietician. Body weight, measured with patients in stocking feet and indoor clothing, was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a bariatric wheelchair digital scale (Rice Lake Healthweigh SB-1000 SummitTM). Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a stadiometer that was fixed to the wall. Body mass index was calculated as weight [kg] / height2 [m]. Sociodemographics. Sociodemographics included participants' sex, age, race/ethnicity, relationship status, number of children, highest level of completed education, and employment status. Procedure Psychological assessments occurred between June 2010 and January 2012 and were conducted in-person or by Telehealth (a videoconferencing application that permits real-time, fact-to-face assessment of patients). Psychological assessments took approximately one hour to complete and included a psychodiagnostic interview and review of the patient's sociodemographics. Patients completed the abovementioned `paper and pencil' self-report measures of emotion regulation difficulties (DERS; Gratz & Roemer, 2004) and functional health status (SF-36; Ware & Sherbourne, 1992) following the orientation class and prior to attending their first individual assessment. Height and weight were measured by a clinic dietician during the nutrition assessment.

Results Demographic and Clinical Characteristics Table 6 summarizes the sociodemographic characteristics of the 321 bariatric surgery candidates who participated in this study. The mean age of participants was 44.37 years (SD = 11.07 years). The oldest participant was 69 years and the youngest participant was 20 years. Participants were predominantly female (80.1%), Caucasian (81.3%), married (51.1%), and had children (70.4%). Approximately half of the participants had completed a college diploma or university degree (50.5%) and two-thirds were employed in full-time or part-time work (65.4%). The mean BMI of participants was 49.59 kg/m2 (SD = 8.91). The highest BMI was 89.30 and the lowest BMI was 34.003. The mean BMI of males (M = 52.42, SD = 10.90) was significantly higher than the mean BMI of females (M = 48.88, SD = 8.22; t (81.72) = -2.434, p = .017). Ninety-one percent of participants had a BMI over 40, while the remaining 9% had a BMI of 34.00 to 39.99.

3

To be eligible for bariatric surgery, patients must have a BMI  35 kg/m 2 at the time of referral. In rare circumstances, the patient's BMI has decreased by the time he or she is weighed by the clinic dietician. Two patients in this study had BMIs < 35 kg/m2 (34.00 and 34.40, respectively).

Prevalence of Axis I Lifetime and Current Psychiatric Disorders Lifetime prevalence. Table 7 summarizes the prevalence of Axis I disorders. Of the 321 participants, 175 (54.5%) were diagnosed with a lifetime psychiatric disorder: a lifetime mood disorder was most common (37.1%), followed by diagnoses of eating (16.8%), anxiety (13.1%), and substance use (6.9%) disorders. Overall, major depressive disorder was the most prevalent lifetime psychiatric disorder (32.4%). Binge eating disorder was diagnosed in 12.5% of the sample and an additional 4.4% of participants met criteria for eating disorder not otherwise specified. The most frequently diagnosed anxiety disorders were panic disorder with and without agoraphobia (both 4.0%). A substance dependence disorder in sustained full remission was the most common substance use disorder (4.0%): 10 participants were diagnosed with past nicotine dependence; 2 had past cannabis dependence; and 1 had past cocaine dependence. Eleven patients were diagnosed with a lifetime adjustment disorder (3.4%); 3 had lifetime attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (0.9%); 2 had a lifetime psychotic disorder (0.6%); and 1 was diagnosed with a lifetime substance abuse disorder (0.3%; amphetamine). The percentage of participants who were diagnosed with 1, 2, or 3 or more lifetime psychiatric disorders was 31.2%, 14.0%, 9.4%, respectively, indicating a high rate of psychiatric comorbidity. Current prevalence. Fifty-nine participants (18.4%) were diagnosed with a current Axis I disorder: eating disorders were most common (8.4%), followed by anxiety (6.9%) and mood (5.3%) disorders. Binge eating disorder was the most prevalent current psychiatric disorder (7.2%). Two patients were diagnosed with a current adjustment disorder (0.6%); 2 had current attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (0.6%); 1 had a current psychotic disorder (0.3%); and 1 had current cannabis dependence (0.3%). The percentage of participants who were diagnosed with 1, 2, or 3 or more current psychiatric disorders was 14.0%, 3.1%, and 1.2%, respectively. 33

Note. Values are shown as n (%). * Statistical tests were conducted with several dependent variables (i.e., females and males were compared on 37 current and 37 lifetime variables), so the  level was adjusted using the Bonferroni procedure to control for familywise error rate. As such, p  .001 indicated a significant effect. Psychodiagnostic assessments were completed with the M.I.N.I. International Neuropsychiatric Interview for ADHD Studies version 6.0 (Sheehan et al., 1998).

Factors Associated with Psychiatric Disorders Next, independent t-tests, chi-square analyses, and Fisher's exact test were used to determine whether participants with and without lifetime or current Axis I psychiatric disorders differed by sex, BMI, or quality of life as measured by the SF-36. Because statistical tests were conducted with several dependent variables (i.e., females and males were compared on 37 current and 37 lifetime psychiatric disorders), the  level was adjusted using the Bonferroni procedure to control for familywise error rate (with 37 comparisons, respectively, p  .001 indicated a significant effect). Results revealed no statistically significant differences in prevalence rates for current psychiatric disorders between females and males. In addition, there were no significant differences in mean BMI between participants with (M = 49.48, SD = 9.17) and without (M = 49.70, SD = 8.68) a lifetime Axis I diagnosis (t (319) = .22, p = .825) or with (M = 49.26, SD = 8.99) and without (M = 49.97, SD = 8.83) a current Axis I diagnosis (t (319) = .71, p = .476). One-sample t -tests with Bonferroni adjusted alpha levels (with 10 comparisons, p  .005 indicated a significant effect) were used to determine whether participants' scores on the SF-36 were significantly different from normative values. As hypothesized, bariatric surgery candidates scored significantly lower than Canadian females and males on all eight domains of the SF-36 and the physical and mental component summary scales (all ps < .001), representing worse physical and mental health status relative to the general adult population (see Table 8). Next, independent t-tests with Bonferroni adjusted alpha levels (p  .005 indicated a significant effect) were used to compare SF-36 functional health status between those with and without a current psychiatric disorder. Compared to those without a current Axis I disorder, participants diagnosed with a current Axis I disorder reported significantly worse functioning on seven of the 37

eight SF-36 subscales: physical functioning (p = .002), bodily pain (p < .001), general health perceptions (p < .001), role limitations because of emotional problems (p < .001), vitality (p < .001), general mental health (p = .002), and social functioning (p < .001). These aforementioned differences represented small-sized effects (rs ranging from .17 to .26; Cohen, 1988, 1992). In addition, as compared to participants without a current Axis I disorder, the mean mental component score was significantly worse in patients with a current Axis I disorder (p < .001), which also represented a small-sized effect (r = .24). Additional comparisons between those with and without a current Axis I disorder on the SF-36 subscales were not statistically significant. These results are presented in Table 9 and illustrated graphically in Figure 2.

Emotion Regulation Descriptive statistics for the DERS are presented for the total sample in Table 10 and separately for females and males in Table 11. Independent t -tests comparing mean scores for females and males on the DERS total and subscale scores were not statistically significant (all ps > .05), suggesting there were no between-sex differences in emotion regulation difficulties. Pearson correlation coefficients showed that BMI was not significantly related to the DERS total score (r = .05) or NON-ACCEPTANCE (r = .06), GOALS (r = -.01), IMPULSE (r = .02), AWARENESS (r = .09), STRATEGIES (r = .01), or CLARITY (r = .07) subscale scores (all ps > .05), indicating no significant associations between body mass and emotion regulation difficulties in this sample.

Next, one-sample t -tests with Bonferroni adjusted alpha levels (with 7 comparisons, p  .007 indicated a significant effect) were used to determine whether participants' scores on the DERS were significantly different from published values. To our knowledge, however, few studies have examined the DERS in a non-clinical sample. As a result, we compared participants' scores to those published in the original article (Gratz & Roemer, 2004), recognizing that the mean age of the non-clinical sample was significantly younger than our own (M = 23.10, range 18-55 years) and that aspects of emotion regulation improve with age (Orgeta, 2009). As Table 11 illustrates, the mean DERS total score for participants was not significantly different from the comparative values. When specific emotion regulation difficulties were examined, both female and male bariatric surgery candidates reported significantly lower scores on the GOALS subscale than adult norms (ps < .001). These differences represented large-sized effects for females and males (r = .52 and r = .51, respectively; Cohen, 1988, 1992) and suggest that bariatric surgery candidates are better able to concentrate and accomplish tasks when experiencing negative emotions relative to the participants in Gratz and Roemer's (2004) study. Female participants also had significantly lower scores than the comparative sample on the CLARITY subscale (a small effect: r = .23; Cohen, 1988, 1992), but significantly higher scores on the AWARENESS subscale (a small effect: r = .19; Cohen, 1988, 1992), suggesting that female bariatric surgery candidates have greater difficulty attending to and acknowledging their emotions, but possess a relative strength in their ability to make sense of the emotions they experience relative to a young adult population. Additional comparisons between participants' scores and Gratz and Roemer's (2004) published values were not statistically significant. Notably, due to the confounding effect of age in these comparisons, the findings should largely be viewed as descriptive and inferential findings should be interpreted with caution. 43

Emotion Regulation and Psychiatric Disorders The next set of analyses used independent t-tests to determine whether difficulties in emotion regulation differed by current Axis I disorder status. It was hypothesized that the presence of a psychiatric disorder would be associated with higher levels of self-reported difficulties in emotion regulation across multiple domains. As each hypothesis was tested with six dependent variables, Bonferroni corrections were used to adjust the alpha level to control for familywise error (p  .007 indicated a significant effect). Compared to patients without a current Axis I disorder, participants with any current Axis I disorder yielded significantly higher scores on the DERS total score and GOALS, IMPULSE, STRATEGIES, and CLARITY subscales, but not the NON-ACCEPTANCE and AWARENESS subscales after Bonferroni correction (see Table 12). The aforementioned differences represented small-sized effects (rs ranging from .19 to .24; Cohen, 1988, 1992). Next, DERS scores were compared between those with and without a current mood disorder. Results revealed that participants with a current mood disorder had significantly higher scores on the DERS total score and GOALS, STRATEGIES, and CLARITY subscales than participants without a current mood disorder, whereas the groups did not differ significantly on the IMPULSE and AWARENESS subscales after Bonferroni correction (see Table 13)4. Group

Because 65% of participants diagnosed with a current mood disorder had a major depressive disorder specifically, we also compared DERS scores between those with and without a current major depressive disorder (i.e., omitting other mood disorders from the analyses) to determine if our results would differ (see Appendix B). Results were largely unchanged. That is, compared to patients without a current major depressive disorder, participants with a current major depressive disorder had significantly higher scores on the DERS total score and GOALS, STRATEGIES, and CLARITY subscales (all ps < .007), but not the IMPULSE and AWARENESS subscales. Only one statistically significant difference emerged: participants with a major depressive disorder had higher scores on the NON-ACCEPTANCE subscale than participants who did not have a major depressive disorder ( p < .007). Overall, whether all mood disorders were included in the analyses, or whether only major depressive disorder was considered, the results were very similar. As such, mood disorders were analysed together in subsequent analyses.

45

differences did not emerge on the NON-ACCEPTANCE subscale. Each of these differences represented a small-sized effect (rs ranging from .20 to .25; Cohen, 1988, 1992). When anxiety disorder status was considered, participants diagnosed with a current anxiety disorder had significantly higher scores on the GOALS subscale (a small-sized effect: r = .17; Cohen, 1988, 1992) than participants who did not have a current anxiety disorder, whereas the groups did not differ significantly on the DERS total score and IMPULSE and CLARITY subscales after Bonferroni correction (see Table 14). There were no group differences on the NONACCEPTANCE, AWARENESS, and STRATEGIES subscales. Finally, when current eating disorder status was considered, there were no statistically significant differences after Bonferroni correction on the DERS total or subscale scores (see Table 15).

To determine if diagnostic status can be predicted by emotion regulation difficulties, data were analysed using two binary logistic regressions (see Appendix C for tests of logistic regression assumptions and diagnostic statistics). In these analyses, current mood disorder status and current anxiety disorder status (0 = disorder absent; 1 = disorder present) were used, in turn, as the outcome variable. As independent t-tests showed that participants with or without a current eating disorder did not differ significantly on emotion regulation difficulties after Bonferroni correction, multivariate analysis was not conducted on this variable. Given past research indicating comorbidity between mood, anxiety, and eating psychopathology (e.g., Clark & Watson, 1991; Hudson, Hiripi, Pope, & Kessler, 2007), prior to conducting the logistic regressions, we first assessed whether these variables were significantly associated with one another, thereby requiring inclusion as covariates in the regression analyses. As expected, results revealed a statistically significant association between current mood and anxiety disorder status (2 (1) = 14.31, p = .003). Current eating disorder status was significantly associated with current anxiety disorder status (2 (1) = 6.28, p = .028) but not with current mood disorder status (2 (1) = 1.99, p = .163). Thus, when predicting current mood disorder status, a hierarchical logistic regression analysis was performed with current anxiety disorder status as a covariate in the first block. Emotion regulation difficulties that showed significant group differences in bivariate analysis (see Table 13) were entered in the second block. When predicting current anxiety disorder status, current mood and eating disorder status were entered as covariates in the first block, and emotion regulation difficulties that showed significant group differences in bivariate analysis (see Table 14) were entered in the second block. Statistical significance was assessed using the Wald statistic and set at p < .05.

51

In step 1 of the first hierarchical regression analysis, having a current anxiety disorder significantly predicted a current mood disorder diagnosis (model 2 (1) = 8.72, p = .003). The addition of the emotion regulation variables (GOALS, STRATEGIES, and CLARITY) at step 2 significantly improved the prediction of whether a patient had a current mood disorder (model 2 (4) = 27.33, p < .001). Overall, the results of the hierarchical regression model showed that the odds of a patient with a current anxiety disorder having a current mood disorder are 4.7 times higher than those of a patient who does not have a current anxiety disorder, adjusting for the aforementioned emotion regulation difficulties. Greater difficulty engaging in goal-directed behaviour when experiencing negative emotions also increased the odds of having a current mood disorder. Specifically, for every one-unit increase on the GOALS subscale of the DERS, the likelihood of having a current mood disorder increased by 1.2, controlling for current anxiety disorder status and other emotion regulation difficulties. To aid in interpreting the odds ratio for the GOALS subscale, consider that scores on this subscale have a range of 20 units. The odds ratio indicates that a one-point increase on this subscale would increase the odds of having a current mood disorder by 1.2. Thus, an increase of 5 units on the GOALS subscale would increase the odds of a current mood disorder by 6 times; a 10-unit increase would increase the odds of a current mood disorder by 12; a 15-unit increase would increase the odds by 18; and a 20-unit increase would increase the odds by 24. Thus, the variable GOALS has a considerable influence on current mood disorder status when measured over the 20-unit range of that subscale. Additional emotion regulation difficulties did not significantly predict whether a patient was diagnosed with a current mood disorder. Thus, as shown in Table 16, the presence of a current anxiety disorder and difficulties engaging in goal-directed behaviour when experiencing negative emotions (GOALS) significantly predicted a current mood disorder. 52

Note. Model 2 (4) = 27.33, p < .001. * p  .05 indicated a significant effect. In step 1 of the second hierarchical regression analysis, a current mood disorder and a current eating disorder significantly predicted the presence of a current anxiety disorder (model 2 (2) = 12.34, p = .002). The addition of the emotion regulation variable GOALS at step 2 significantly improved the prediction of whether a patient had a current anxiety disorder (model 2 (3) = 16.86, p = .001). Overall, hierarchical regression analysis showed that the odds of a patient with a current mood disorder having a current anxiety disorder are 4.0 times higher than the odds of a patient without a current mood disorder, adjusting for a current eating disorder and emotion regulation difficulties. Moreover, the odds of a patient with a current eating disorder having a current anxiety disorder were 3.16 times higher than those of a patient without a current eating disorder, adjusting for a current mood disorder and emotion regulation difficulties. As in 53

the previous model predicting current mood disorder status, greater difficulty engaging in goaldirected behaviour when experiencing negative emotions was the only emotion regulation variable that increased the risk of a current anxiety disorder. Specifically, for every one-unit increase on the GOALS subscale, the likelihood of having an anxiety disorder increased by 1.12, controlling for current mood and eating disorder status. Thus, interpreted across the 20-unit range of the GOALS subscale, a 5-unit increase on the GOALS subscale would increase the odds of a current anxiety disorder by 5.6; a 10-unit increase would increase the odds by 11.2; a 15-unit increase would increase the odds by 16.8; and a 20-unit increase would increase the odds by 22.4. Thus, as shown in Table 17, a current mood disorder, current eating disorder, and difficulties engaging in goal-directed behaviour when experiencing negative emotions (GOALS) significantly predicted a current anxiety disorder.

Finally, a multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to evaluate whether greater difficulties in emotion regulation predicted a greater number of current Axis I disorders (see Appendix D for tests of linear regression assumptions and diagnostic statistics). Regression results are shown in Table 18. Results demonstrated that the combination of the six DERS subscales accounted for ~7.8% of the variance in the total number of current Axis I disorders. Difficulties engaging in goal-directed behaviour when experiencing negative emotions was a significant predictor of the total number of current Axis I disorders, with greater difficulties predicting more current Axis I diagnoses.

Discussion Prevalence of Axis I Lifetime and Current Psychiatric Disorders Most bariatric surgery programs require patients to have a pre-operative mental health assessment (Bauchowitz et al., 2005; Devlin et al., 2004; Santry et al., 2006) due to the impact that psychosocial variables may have on post-operative outcome. High rates of psychopathology have indeed been documented in bariatric surgery patients (Kalarchian et al., 2007; Mühlhans et al., 2009; Muri et al., 2008; Rosenberger et al., 2006), although no rigorous study to date has examined the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in a Canadian sample of bariatric patients. Reliable data on the prevalence of psychopathology is a pressing need in clinical research as such information will guide the development and refinement of interventions for bariatric patients. Using a structured psychodiagnostic interview and DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria, the first purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in 321 bariatric surgery candidates. Our results indicate that the majority of patients (55%) were diagnosed with a lifetime Axis I disorder. A sizeable proportion of those patients (43%) received multiple lifetime psychiatric diagnoses. Approximately 18% of patients had a current Axis I disorder, with 23% of those individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for multiple diagnoses. Mood disorders were the most prevalent lifetime class of psychiatric disorder and eating disorders were the most prevalent class of psychiatric disorder at the time of pre-operative assessment. Cross study comparisons. As reviewed in the Introduction of this paper, four studies have investigated the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in bariatric surgery candidates using psychodiagnostic interviews and DSM-IV-TR criteria (Kalarchian et al., 2007; Mühlhans et al., 2009; Muri et al., 2008; Rosenberger et al., 2006). Amongst the reviewed studies, estimates of 56

lifetime and current Axis I disorders ranged from 37-73% and 24-56%, respectively (see Tables 3 and 4). Comparison of our findings with prevalence estimates from other studies should be made cautiously, however, as the disorders assessed across these studies were similar, but not identical. For instance, only Rosenberger et al. (2006) and the current study reported prevalence rates for psychotic disorders and adjustment disorders, whereas it is not clear from other reports whether these disorders were assessed. Somatoform disorders were assessed by Mühlhans et al. (2009) and Rosenberger et al. (2006), but were not assessed in the current study or other studies (Kalarchian et al., 2007; Mauri et al., 2008). Differential assessment of individual disorders across mood, anxiety, eating, and substance use diagnostic categories also occurred. A direct comparison of prevalence rates for diagnostic categories would therefore be misleading. However, if we limit our considerations to comparisons of single psychiatric disorders, some interesting trends emerge. First, prior reports indicate that major depressive disorder is consistently diagnosed as the single most common lifetime disorder in bariatric surgery candidates, with estimates ranging from 22 to 55% (Kalarchian et al., 2007; Mühlhans et al., 2009; Muri et al., 2008; Rosenberger et al., 2006). In our study, major depressive disorder was also the most common lifetime psychiatric disorder, diagnosed in 32% of patients. In the current study, binge eating disorder was the most prevalent psychiatric disorder (7%) at the time of preoperative assessment. In comparison, others have found current rates of binge eating disorder to range from 3 to 23% in pre-operative patients (Kalarchian et al., 2007; Mühlhans et al., 2009; Muri et al., 2008; Rosenberger et al., 2006). The low prevalence of current alcohol and nonalcohol substance use disorders in our sample (0% and 0.4%, respectively) is also in keeping with prior reports indicating that substance use disorders are infrequently diagnosed in preoperative bariatric surgery patients (estimates of 0 to 0.7% for current alcohol use disorder and 0 57

to 1.0% for current non-alcohol substance use disorder; Kalarchian et al., 2007; Mühlhans et al., 2009; Mauri et al., 2008; Rosenberger et al., 2006). In terms of these broad comparisons, the trend in results is consistent across studies. Whether specific differences in prevalence rates are due to differences in methodology, site-specific differences in the characteristics of patients presenting for bariatric surgery, or some unknown variable is a matter for further research. General population comparisons. Amongst three of the four prevalence studies (Kalarchian et al., 2007; Mauri et al., 2008; Mühlhans et al., 2009), rates of psychiatric disorders were elevated in bariatric surgery candidates compared to US, Italian, and German population norms, respectively. One study, conducted by Rosenberger et al. (2006), found prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders that were comparable to US population norms. In comparison, results from this study suggest that certain psychiatric disorders were more common in bariatric surgery candidates, whereas other psychiatric disorders were less common, relative to non-obese individuals and non-treatment-seeking obese individuals in Canada. Specifically, the lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder in bariatric surgery candidates from our study (32%) was considerably higher than rates reported among obese (16%) and non-obese adults (12%) who were surveyed in the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) - Mental Health and Well-Being (Mather, Cox, Enns, & Sareen, 2009). In contrast, prevalence estimates for a lifetime panic disorder and agoraphobia without history of panic disorder appeared to be similar in our sample of bariatric surgery candidates (4.0% and 0.9%, respectively) and obese (3.7% and 1.5%, respectively) and non-obese (3.7% and 1.0%, respectively) CCHS adults. Lifetime social phobia was least common in bariatric surgery patients (2.8%), followed by non-obese (7.9%) and obese (9.2%) CCHS adults. Finally, when compared to adults from the CCHS, alcohol dependence in the past 12 months was least common in bariatric patients (0%), followed by 58

obese adults (2.1%), and non-obese adults (2.6%), as was illicit drug dependence (0.3%, 0.3%, and 0.8%, respectively). Additional comparisons of prevalence rates between bariatric surgery candidates and adults from the CCHS could not be made due to differential assessment of psychiatric disorders. In summary, compared to obese and non-obese Canadian adults, descriptive comparisons suggest elevated rates of major depressive disorder, reduced rates of alcohol and non-alcohol substance use disorders, lower rates of social phobia, and comparable rates of panic disorder with agoraphobia and agoraphobia without history of panic disorder in pre-operative bariatric surgery patients. Interestingly, there is evidence that the prevalence of psychiatric disorders differs between obese adults who seek treatment and those who do not. For instance, in a nationally representative sample of the German adult population, Baumeister and Hrter (2007) examined the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in four participant groups: physically healthy, normal weight adults (N = 495); overweight adults from the general population (N = 1550); obese adults from the general population (N = 797); and obese adults who were rehabilitation inpatients with concurrent somatic diseases (N = 113). Overall, the lifetime prevalence rates of any psychiatric disorder increased significantly from healthy adults (37.6%) to overweight adults (44.0%) to obese adults (46.0%) to obese inpatients (54.9%). Mood, anxiety, and somatoform disorders were significantly elevated in overweight and obese individuals versus healthy probands, whereas the prevalence of substance use disorders did not differ significantly between the groups. In addition, comorbid psychiatric disorders were significantly more common in overweight and obese participants, compared to healthy probands. Significant associations between obesity and psychopathology, particularly major depressive disorder, have led researchers to speculate that obesity may be of causal importance in the etiology of certain 59

psychiatric disorders or vice versa, in vulnerable individuals. It is also possible that the two are related to one or more common diatheses. The possibly of causal links between obesity and psychopathology, and the limitations of cross-sectional data in drawing such conclusions, are discussed in the next section. Factors Associated with Psychiatric Disorders Sex and BMI. We did not find any significant differences in current or lifetime prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders by sex or BMI, which is in accordance with some studies in bariatric surgery candidates and not with others. Mühlhans et al. (2009) found that females were more likely than males to have a lifetime mood or eating disorder, but significant between-sex differences did not emerge for any individual psychiatric diagnosis. Rosenberger et al. (2006) reported higher rates of current anxiety disorders in females than males, but did not find statistically significant differences across individual anxiety disorders between the sexes. Rosenberger et al. (2006) also found that females were more likely than males to meet diagnostic criteria for a lifetime mood or anxiety disorder, with major depressive disorder diagnosed more often in females. Mauri et al. (2008) found the prevalence of individual psychiatric diagnoses did not differ between males and females or by BMI class. Kalarchian et al. (2007) did not report prevalence rates by sex, but found that patients with a current psychiatric disorder had a significantly higher BMI than those without. In our sample, prevalence rates for a lifetime mood disorder, particularly major depressive disorder, showed a trend towards females having higher prevalence rates than males. Prevalence estimates for a lifetime substance use disorder showed a trend towards males reporting higher prevalence rates than females, which was not statistically significant. These trends in data are in keeping with results from the CCHS, which found that mood disorders were more common in females than males in the general population and 60

substance use disorders were more common in males than females in the general population (Mather et al., 2009). Quality of life. In addition to determining lifetime and current prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders, as a marker of clinical significance, a second goal of this study was to examine associations with quality of life. Our results replicate earlier findings by demonstrating that bariatric surgery patients with a current psychiatric disorder have significantly worse quality of life than patients not diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder (Kalarchian et al., 2007; Mauri et al., 2008). This effect was not only found for the mental health aspects of quality of life, but also the majority of physical aspects of quality of life. Similarly, Baumeister and Hrter (2007) reported significantly reduced physical and mental health quality of life in obese individuals with at least one psychiatric disorder, as compared to obese individuals without a psychiatric disorder. In line with our hypothesis, we extend prior reports by demonstrating that mean quality of life across all eight physical and mental health domains of the SF-36 was significantly worse in bariatric surgery candidates compared to norms from a Canadian sample of female and male adults. Future examinations may wish to include metrics of general and obesity-specific quality of life (e.g., the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life Questionnaire [IWQOL]; Kolotkin, Crosby, Kosloski, & Williams, 2001) to measure multidimensional changes following bariatric surgery that extend beyond the physical measurements of weight loss. Indeed, as Kolotkin and colleagues (2001) suggest, the data obtained from the IWQOL can provide positive reinforcement to patients, and a performance indicator to healthcare professionals, as it provides information outside weight-specific data (e.g., the impact of obesity on physical function, selfesteem, sexual life, public distress, and work) to assess the overall effectiveness of the obesity treatment. 61

Emotion Regulation and Psychopathology in Bariatric Surgery Candidates Thus far, our findings suggest that pre-operative Axis I psychiatric disorders warrant attention in bariatric surgery candidates not only because they are relatively common, but because they are associated with significantly worse mental and physical health quality of life. At present, there is limited data on the prognostic significance of pre-operative psychiatric disorders and psychopathology is not a contraindication for surgery per se. What is apparent, however, is that bariatric surgery does not have the same outcome for all patients and this is due in part to psychological factors that may affect the patient's ability to adapt and adhere to the post-operative changes in lifestyle. In recent years, the number of bariatric surgeries performed annually has increased over 14-fold in Canada (Padwal & Lewanczuk, 2005) and over 6-fold in the United States (Steinbrook, 2004). In light of the growing number of individuals who opt for surgical treatment of obesity, there is an increasing need for psychosocial interventions that prepare patients for surgery and support them thereafter (Kalarchian et al., 2007; Mauri et al., 2008). Such interventions would ideally be effective for a range of psychopathologies, tailored to the specific needs of bariatric surgery patients, and feasible for clinicians and patients alike. As detailed in the Introduction of this paper, a growing body of empirical literature has highlighted commonalities in emotion regulation difficulties in the development and treatment of mood, anxiety, and eating disorders (e.g., Aldao & Nolen-Hoeksema, 2010; Aldao, NolenHoeksema, & Schweizer, 2010). This work has been termed "transdiagnostic" and is intriguing in that mechanisms that are found to be common across diverse symptom presentations could theoretically be targeted using a unified approach rather than disorder-specific protocols (Mansell et al., 2009). In addition, clinicians' time, training demands and associated expenses would be reduced, allowing for greater dissemination of treatment (Wilamowska et al., 2010). In 62

light of emerging evidence that emotion regulation difficulties may be transdiagnostic factors underlying various types of psychopathology, the second purpose of this study was to examine whether the diverse psychiatric difficulties that bariatric surgery patients may exhibit might have an emotion regulation piece in common. Notably, emotion regulation difficulties have typically been studied in isolation, so as to assess their individual contributions to psychopathology (see Aldao et al., 2010). In addition, most examinations of emotion regulation difficulties have been disorder-specific, thereby limiting tests of transdiagnostic mechanisms that may underlie various forms of psychopathology (see Aldao et al., 2010). The present study sought to address these two prior limitations by examining the specificity of six different emotion regulation difficulties across three psychodiagnostic categories. More specifically, we examined whether difficulties in emotion regulation were `common' determinants of mood, anxiety, and eating disorders and/or `specific' determinants distinguishing one psychodiagnostic category from the other as such information would help guide interventions. Critically, we also tested whether each psychiatric disorder would continue to be associated with emotion regulation difficulties when other psychiatric disorders were taken into account. In this respect, we were able to statistically control for the high comorbidity seen amongst psychiatric disorders, which permitted a better understanding of the unique associations of emotion regulation difficulties with each diagnostic category. Prior to examining associations between emotion regulation difficulties and mood, anxiety, and eating disorders, we examined whether bariatric surgery patients were characterized by difficulties in emotion regulation by comparing their total and subscale scores on the DERS to gender-specific non-clinical values. Our data illustrate that as a group, bariatric surgery candidates reported difficulties in emotion regulation that were fairly comparable to, or better than, the comparative sample of young adults. It should be noted, however, that these findings 63

are descriptive in nature as prior reports have indicated that emotion regulation improves with age (Orgeta, 2009). As additional studies using the DERS are published, future work will be better able to document how bariatric surgery patients' reported emotion regulation difficulties compare to non-clinical groups. Emotion regulation and psychiatric disorders. We examined the association between six emotion regulation difficulties (GOALS, IMPULSE, STRATEGIES, CLARITY, NONACCEPTANCE and AWARENESS) and three psychodiagnostic categories (mood, anxiety, and eating disorders). We also examined whether greater difficulties in emotion regulation predicted psychiatric comorbidity (i.e., the number of current Axis I disorders, ranging from 0 to 3). Our results showed that the emotion regulation difficulties GOALS, IMPULSE, STRATEGIES, and CLARITY, but not NON-ACCEPTANCE and AWARENESS, predicted a diagnosis of any current Axis I disorder after Bonferroni correction. Subsequent multivariate analyses revealed some interesting findings, suggesting that the association between emotion regulation difficulties and psychopathology might vary by symptomatology. Specifically, we found that difficulties engaging in goal-directed behaviour (i.e., difficulty concentrating and accomplishing important tasks) when experiencing negative emotions uniquely predicted a current mood disorder, which is consistent with prior reports (e.g., Ehring et al., 2008; Tull & Gratz, 2008). This finding was robust as it remained significant after Bonferroni correction and current anxiety disorder status was controlled for statistically. Additional emotion regulation variables did not significantly predict whether a patient was diagnosed with a current mood disorder. Participants with a current anxiety disorder also reported experiencing difficulty engaging in goal-directed behaviour when experiencing negative emotions, which remained statistically significant after Bonferroni correction and controlling for the influence of current mood and eating disorder 64

status. In addition, the GOALS subscale uniquely predicted the total number of current Axis I disorders, with greater difficulties engaging in goal-directed behaviour when experiencing negative emotions predicting a greater number of current Axis I diagnoses. Overall, these findings are consistent with behavioural theories of depression, which posit that the onset and maintenance of depressed mood stems from a lack of positive reinforcement in the environment (Lewinsohn, 1974; Jacobson, Martell, & Dimidgian, 2001). That is, difficulties engaging in goal-directed behaviour when experiencing negative emotions may increase risk for the development and maintenance of depressed mood by limiting the extent to which individuals come into contact with positive-reinforcement. Indeed, behavioural activation, an empirically support standalone treatment or adjunct to cognitive therapy for depression, begins with a thorough assessment of the client's behavioural goals, which then define the activation assignments. In essence, the client's goals guide the behavioural activation targets, which in turn increase the client's contact with sources of pleasure in the environment. Similarly, anxiety sensitivity (e.g., fear of publically observable anxiety reactions, fear of cardiovascular sensations) has been associated with difficulties engaging in goal-directed behaviour when distressed (Salters-Pedneault et al., 2006), which is consistent with reports that anxiety sensitivity may increase the risk of relying upon maladaptive ways of coping with emotions (e.g., avoidance). Taken together, these preliminary findings suggest that difficulty engaging in goaldirected behaviour may be a common correlate of mood and anxiety psychodiagnostic categories in bariatric surgery candidates, even after other psychopathologies are controlled. Not all of our hypotheses were supported, however, as difficulties in emotion regulation were not significantly associated with current eating disorder status after Bonferroni correction. This finding was unexpected as binge eating ­ the form of eating psychopathology most 65

commonly endorsed by bariatric patients ­ is often conceptualized as an attempt to regulate or escape from unwanted emotions because more adaptive strategies are ineffective or lacking (Heatherton & Baumeister, 1991; McCarthy, 1990). Nevertheless, this finding is in line with prior reports demonstrating a weaker relationship between emotion regulation difficulties and eating disorder pathology than for depression and anxiety (Aldao et al., 2010; Weinberg & Klonsky, 2009). Although it is premature to draw conclusions between previous findings and the results from this study, a few explanations come to mind. First, although negative affect is a well-established trigger of binge eating, a second notable trigger to binge eating is dietary restriction, which can be physiological or cognitive in nature (Polivy & Herman, 1985). Physiological restriction results from extended (e.g., in the case of chronic dieting) or episodic caloric restriction (e.g., skipping meals) and promotes overeating via hunger. Individuals who endorse cognitive restraint are characterized by attempts to restrict their caloric intake that do not reach actual caloric deprivation and precipitates overeating via cognitive mechanisms (e.g., breaking strict dietary rules can promote disinhibited eating; Polivy & Herman, 1985). These two precursors to overeating (negative affect and dietary restriction) were articulated in Stice's dual-pathway model (1994, 2001), which was subsequently validated in clinical samples of bulimic females, undergraduate students, and more recently in overweight females (e.g., Shepherd, & Ricciardelli, 1998; Stice, 2001; Stice, Shaw, & Nemeroff, 1998; Van Strien, Engels, Van Leeuwe, & Snoek, 2005). At present, less is known about the triggers of binge eating in bariatric surgery patients, but it is possible that episodic physiological restraint (e.g., resultant from skipping meals) or cognitive restraint (i.e., perceived caloric deprivation irrespective of actual dietary intake), is a more potent predictor of binge eating amongst bariatric surgery patients as a group than is psychological distress. 66

A second explanation for the weaker association between emotion regulation difficulties and eating disorder status is that binge eating, in-and-of-itself, may be emotionally regulating. This hypothesis is in accordance with affect regulation and escape theories (Heatherton & Baumeister, 1991; McCarthy, 1990) and suggests that individuals who binge eat may endorse fewer emotion regulation difficulties simply because binge eating satisfied their emotion regulation needs. Still, we note a trend in our data that individuals with a current eating disorder reported more difficulties regulating their emotions than those without an eating disorder across the six DERS domains. In particular, patients with a current eating disorder reported more difficulty refraining from impulsive behaviour when experiencing negative emotions than patients without an eating disorder, although this difference was not significantly different after Bonferroni correction. Future work should examine the applicability of the dual-pathway model (Stice, 1994, 2001) in bariatric surgery patients and whether binge eating actually does serve to regulate negative emotions (e.g., via comfort or distraction) in bariatric surgery patients. It would also be interesting to examine the interaction of these variables (e.g., is negative affect predictive of overeating independent of dietary restraint or only in the context of dietary restraint?) and how these variables interact with emotion regulation skills and individual differences (e.g., impulse control). These preliminary findings suggest that mood and anxiety disorders are more closely related to problems in emotion regulation than eating disorders in bariatric surgery candidates. This finding is in accordance with results from a recent meta-analysis, which found that emotion regulation strategies had stronger associations with symptoms of depression and anxiety than to eating disorders (Aldao et al., 2010) and with findings suggesting that internalizing psychiatric symptoms (i.e., depression and anxiety) are more strongly related to emotion regulation than 67

externalizing disorders (i.e., eating disorders; Garnefski, Kraaij, & van Etten, 2005). Taken together, these findings further implicate the important role of emotion regulation in mood and anxiety disorders and also psychiatric comorbidity. Before discussing the implications of these preliminary findings and directions for future research, the strengths and limitations of this study are discussed in turn below. Strengths and Limitations The strengths of this study included the assessment of a broad range of Axis I disorders, including mood, anxiety, eating, substance use, psychotic, and adjustment disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, using a standardized psychodiagnostic interview procedure, and a large sample of consecutively referred patients. Primarily due to time constraints in the pre-assessment process, we did not assess for Axis II disorders. In a recent study, Mauri et al. (2008) used the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II; First, Gibbon, Spitzer, Williams, & Benjamin, 1997) to assess pre-operative bariatric surgery patients. Results indicated that 19.5% of the sample met diagnostic criteria for a personality disorder, with cluster C (anxious or fearful) traits predominating. In a study by Kalarchian et al. (2007), 29% of pre-operative bariatric surgery patients met diagnostic criteria for an Axis II disorder, as assessed by the SCID-II (First et al., 1997). Again, cluster C personality disorders were most common, with 17% of the sample meeting diagnostic criteria for avoidant personality disorder. Results from these studies suggest that Axis II psychopathology is common among bariatric surgery candidates and suggests the need to examine its impact on post-operative outcomes. For instance, patients with avoidant personality disorder may be less inclined to ask for help from healthcare professionals for fear of being criticized, shamed, or

rejected. Similarly, they may have poorer adherence to appointments. Such associations are worthy of additional study. Additional strengths of the present study are that all interviewers were clinically experienced psychiatrists, psychologists, or psychometrists who had training and experience in the psychodiagnostic assessment of bariatric surgery patients. In addition, height and weight were measured in our clinic to provide objective measures of BMI and we used well-validated self-reports of quality of life and emotion regulation difficulties. Impression management. Despite the rigor of our assessment process, it remains possible that our prevalence rates may be biased if patients attempted to minimize their psychiatric symptoms in order to maximize their chance of receiving a positive recommendation from the psychosocial team. Anecdotal reports from bariatric surgery candidates indicate that many are aware (e.g., via online discussion boards, peer support groups, friends or family members) that the absence of an unconditional recommendation for surgery from the psychosocial team may postpone or contraindicate surgery. Accordingly, in a recent study, Ambwani et al. (2011) found that measures of socially desirable responding were inversely correlated with self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety, but not alcohol-use problems. In addition, Fabricatore, Sarwer, Wadden, Combs, and Krasucki (2007) compared bariatric surgery candidates' self-reported depression scores before their pre-operative psychiatric evaluation and two to four weeks after the evaluation, and found a small but statistically significant increase in depressive symptoms across assessments. Thus, there is some support for impression management in bariatric patients and alternative hypotheses should also be considered. First, as Fabricatore et al. (2007) note in their report, it should be emphasized that the psychometric properties (e.g., construct validity) of the impression management construct 69

have yet to be demonstrated in bariatric surgery patients and normative responding has not been established. Second, it is equally possible that changes in symptoms between assessments may reflect true symptom change. As Fabricatore et al. (2007) state in their report, due to the impending post-operative lifestyle changes and the possibility of surgical complications, the recommendation to proceed with surgery may represent a stressor for some patients, thereby increasing psychological distress. In the current study, efforts were made to limit the possibility of socially desirable responding, thereby increasing the likelihood of an accurate assessment. First, as previously detailed, assessments were done face-to-face and many psychiatric disorders (e.g., depression or psychosis) have emotional, cognitive, and behavioural symptomatology that would be difficult to conceal during an in-person interview. Other contraindications, such as purging behaviours or active substance abuse or dependence, are more difficult to detect without patient disclosure. In circumstances where past or present psychopathology is suspected (e.g., due to inconsistent or vague reporting during the psychiatric interview or across interdisciplinary assessments, history of psychiatric treatment, disability insurance related to mental health), collateral information on psychiatric stability was always sought (e.g., by contacting the referring physician or allied healthcare professionals) and additional assessments occurred if needed. Thus, although socially desirable responding remains a possibility, attempts were made to increase the veracity of the assessment process. At present, additional research on the frequency of impression management and the impact this may or may not have on post-operative outcomes is warranted. In the interim, it is important that clinicians take steps to increase the validity of their assessment with the purpose of facilitating patients' preparedness for surgery.

Study sample and generalization of findings. The study sample was mainly composed of middle-aged Caucasian females. Most patients were married and had completed at least some post-secondary education. As such, our findings and conclusions will be most relevant to individuals who fit this profile and the generalizability to other bariatric surgery patients may be limited. It is noteworthy that the sociodemographics of our sample are strikingly similar to the profile of bariatric surgery candidates reported in prior studies from different geographical sites (e.g., Kalarchian et al., 2007), suggesting that our data is a good representation of bariatric surgery candidates in general. However, despite rising rates of obesity and a treatment that has been declared "the most effective therapy available for morbid obesity" (Buchwald, 2005), the homogeneity of this group raises the question of why individuals who would be eligible for bariatric surgery are not pursuing this treatment option. In terms of gender comparisons, high rates of obesity are well-documented in both females and males (WHO, 2011), yet the vast majority of individuals seeking weight loss treatment are females (e.g., Zizza, Herring, Stevens, & Carey, 2003). In a review of the demographic characteristics of 1107 Canadian adults undergoing bariatric surgery in 2002/2003, Padwal (2005) found that 85% of patients were female. Similarly, in their retrospective examination of 87,749 American adults undergoing bariatric surgery, Martin, Beekley, Kjorstad, and Sebesta (2010) found that 81% of the sample was female. In the current study, 80% of the sample was female. Prior research has demonstrated that obesity carries greater stigma for females than males (Brownell, 1991; Lokken, Ferraro, Kirchner, & Bowling, 2003), so it is possible that obese females experience greater distress and would be more motivated to pursue treatment options. Moreover, Grover, Keel, and Mitchell (2003) reported that males tend to regard themselves as "light" regardless of their current body weight, which may account for why males are underrepresented in weight loss 71

programs. In accordance with this suggestion, our data illustrate that the mean BMI of males seeking bariatric surgery was significantly higher than that of female candidates (M = 52.42 vs. M = 48.88, respectively), suggesting that males may delay seeking treatment because they are less distressed by, and/or unaware of, their obesity status. Recently, Afonso, Rosenthal, Li, Zapatier, and Szomstein (2010) interviewed 77 obese adults who were eligible for bariatric surgery and found that 57% of respondents were not interested in a surgical procedure to lose weight. When surveyed about their reasons for not pursuing bariatric surgery, 45% of individuals were concerned about the risk of death and surgical complications, with Latin Americans reporting significantly more concern than other ethnic groups. In addition, only 30% of the patients eligible for bariatric surgery assessed themselves as overweight/obese, which suggests that adults may not pursue a referral for bariatric surgery because they are unaware of their obesity status. Although bariatric surgery is indicated for those with a BMI  40 kg/m2 or a BMI  35 kg/m2 with obesity-related comorbidities (NIH, 1991), our results showed that the mean BMI of participants at the time of referral was 49.59 kg/m2, which indeed signifies a delay in referral and/or treatment seeking. In their report, Afonso et al. (2010) also indicate that 30% of primary care physicians did not recommend bariatric surgery. Similarly, other studies have reported that less than half of obese adults are advised to lose weight by their healthcare professional and that middle-aged females with greater levels of education are the cohort most likely to receive advice (Galuska, Will, Serdula, & Ford, 1999). Perlman, Reinhold, and Nadzam (2007) found that the most common reasons that family practitioners did not refer eligible patients for bariatric surgery were concerns about complications and death, belief that the patient would not follow the required postoperative lifestyle changes, and discomfort explaining the gastric bypass procedure to patients. 72

Interestingly, although recent research has highlighted socioeconomic disparities as a barrier to bariatric surgery, Afonso et al. (2010) found that financial status was not a primary reason for patients to not consider having bariatric surgery. As detailed in the Introduction of this paper, healthcare is publically funded in Canada, so healthcare insurance is not required to qualify for bariatric surgery. Accordingly, in our study, financial limitations did not appear to be a principal barrier for bariatric surgery as almost 30% of the sample was unemployed or receiving financial support from the provincial government (i.e., social assistance or disability insurance). As other investigators have reported, the perceived barriers to bariatric surgery are multifactorial and present among patients and healthcare professionals. Education of both groups on the indications for surgery, as well as the safety and benefit of bariatric surgery is needed, perhaps in the form of community-based educational programs and training directed towards healthcare practitioners. Cross-sectional data. A final consideration is that our data were cross-sectional in nature, so it is not possible to make inferences about the causal role of obesity in triggering psychiatric disorders or vice versa, or how difficulties in emotion regulation may interact with these variables to cause or exacerbate psychopathology. Some have hypothesized that psychopathology may precipitate the onset of obesity in vulnerable individuals. In support of this contention, in prospective, epidemiological study, Roberts, Kaplan, Shema, and Strawbridge (2000) found that obese adults were significantly more likely to meet DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for depression than normal weight and underweight adults. Moreover, compared to non-obese adults, obese adults who were not depressed at baseline were almost twice as likely to have major depressive disorder one year later after controlling for an array of psychosocial risk factors. In addition, as discussed in this paper, individuals often report overeating in response to 73

negative emotions (Van Strien, Schippers, & Cox, 1995), which in the absence of more adaptive emotion regulation strategies, could promote weight gain overtime. In accordance with this theory, in a prospective, longitudinal study over 20 years, Hasler et al. (2005) found that depressive symptoms during childhood predicted an increased incidence of adult obesity, which was partially mediated by binge eating after controlling for a variety of covariates (e.g., family history of weight problems, antidepressant use). On the other hand, the stigma of obesity is pervasive (DeJong & Kleck, 1986), which may play a role in the development of psychopathology. Compared with normal-weight individuals, obese individuals are described as "slow," "lazy," "self-indulgent," "stupid," and "boring" (Greenleaf, Starks, Gomez, Chambliss, & Martin, 2004; Maroney & Golub, 1992; Tiggemann & Anesbury, 2000). There is also compelling evidence of widespread discrimination of the obese (see Puhl & Brownell, 2001 for a review). As one example, Pingitoire, Dugoni, Tindale, and Spring (1994) showed participants a series of mock videotaped interviews with professional actors serving as job applicants for computer and sales positions. Bodyweight of the actors was manipulated using theatrical prostheses. Despite having identical qualifications, obese job candidates were less likely to be hired, more likely to be denied promotions, and were paid lower wages for the same job, relative to non-obese individuals. Thus, because obese individuals live in a culture that condemns them for their physical appearance, it is logical that they would experience emotional distress. The effect of obesity on psychopathology and vice versa is as yet unclear, and the inconsistency of results across studies has led some to claim that obese individuals are not at increased risk for psychopathology. However, Friedman and Brownell (1995) have stated that it is premature to draw this conclusion as the inconsistency in findings may be the by-product of weak methodological studies (e.g., the use of outdated measures, limited range of assessment, 74

poor representation of segments of the obese population, and inadequate control of sociodemographics variables). Indeed, a reasonable alternative hypothesis of the discrepancy between studies is that obese individuals are varied in terms of psychological functioning (Friedman & Brownell, 1995; Stunkard & Wadden, 1992). The study of psychopathology in obese individuals presenting for treatment provides an opportune avenue of research as this is a group of individuals that is likely distressed by their condition and motivated to receive treatment. Thus, by examining the characteristics of treatment-seeking individuals, including patients presenting for bariatric surgery, it may be possible to isolate risk factors for psychological distress (Friedman & Brownell, 1995). In addition, because not all obese individuals suffer from psychological distress, it may also be possible to identify variables that serve as protective factors. Some logical next steps for future examinations may help elucidate the obesity-psychopathology association. First, future studies should aim to include a variety of control groups (e.g., normal weight, overweight, and obese individuals in the general population; surgical and medical controls) in order to provide reference data against which to compare the characteristics of obese people in treatment. Second, to elucidate whether and why the psychological correlates of obesity vary across individuals, continued study of the moderating variables that may place an individual at risk for psychopathology are warranted. Third, in order to establish causal links of these variables, future research will need to employ prospective, longitudinal studies to examine the onset of psychopathology in psychiatrically healthy individuals with and without obesity at baseline, and vice versa. Implications, Recommendations, and Directions for Future Research The prevalence of psychopathology in patients seeking bariatric surgery emphasizes the necessity of routine psychiatric screening and comprehensive assessment when indicated both 75

before and after surgery. Routine assessment, in turn, would signal the need for intervention to optimize the patient's preparedness for surgery and maximize the likelihood of long-term success. At present, treatment decision-making is complicated, however, because the effect of psychopathology on outcomes after surgery is unclear. In terms of weight loss outcomes, there is evidence that patients with a lifetime Axis I disorder before surgery, particularly disorders of mood and anxiety, lose significantly less weight at six months after surgery than patients who have never been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder (Kalarchian, Marcus, Levine, Soulakova, Courcoulas, & Wisinski, 2008). One study examined outcomes at  30 months post-surgery and found less weight loss among patients with a pre-operative Axis I or II disorder (Kinzl et al., 2006). A recent review of 32 studies published between 1995 and 2006 concluded that patients with binge eating behaviour before surgery were more likely to display binge eating behaviour after surgery, and among those who continued to binge, to have less weight loss (Niego, Kofman, Weiss, & Geliebter, 2007). Moreover, recent reports have indicated that disordered eating behaviour pre-surgery (including binge eating and night eating syndromes) predicted eating disturbances two or more years after surgery, but not in the first two post-operative years (Hsu, Sullivan, & Benotti, 1997). This finding underscores the important fact that psychological difficulties may take time to re-emerge after surgery, which stresses the need for long-term follow-up of patients. Aside from the effects of psychopathology on weight outcomes, pre-existing psychiatric symptoms may place patients at greater risk of psychological complications following bariatric surgery. For instance, pre-operative depression has been associated with suicide after surgery in a small number of patients. Omalu and colleagues (2005) reviewed three cases that had completed suicide following bariatric surgery and showed that each patient had a lifetime 76

diagnosis of major depressive disorder according to DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria. Interestingly, each patient had lost a significant proportion of their pre-surgery body weight (41%, 40%, and 25%, respectively). As such, Omalu and colleagues (2005) conclude that bariatric surgery patients with a history of depression may require long-term psychiatric treatment to mitigate their risk of suicide after surgery, regardless of successful and sustained weight loss. Pre- and post-operative assessment. Thus, pre-operative psychopathology has been identified as a predictor of reduced post-surgical weight loss and worse psychological functioning. At present, however, a consensus is lacking regarding the optimal management of bariatric patients who display unstable psychiatric symptoms. Depending on the nature and severity of the presenting symptoms identified in the assessment, suggested interventions have ranged from standalone behavioural strategies to trials of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). Some have emphasized the importance of self-monitoring after surgery (e.g., Sarwer, Dilks, & West-Smith, 2011), to catch problematic eating behaviours and small increases in weight before they become a bigger problem. As Sarwer et al. (2011) aptly state in their review, selfmonitoring strategies such as food records and regular weigh-ins are the cornerstone of behaviourally based weight loss programs and may serve an important role for bariatric surgery patients. In the Preparing for Weight Loss Surgery workbook, Apple, Lock, and Peebles (2007) recommend weekly weight monitoring on a regular basis to increase patients' awareness of fluctuations in bodyweight over time. The impact of self-monitoring in bariatric surgery patients is as yet unstudied, but may have positive effects on long-term weight management. Frequency of appointments. A second recommendation has been to increase the frequency of post-surgical assessments to monitor weight loss, eating behaviour, and 77

psychopathology. This recommendation may be especially important for patients with a history of severe psychopathology or for those who display sub-clinical psychiatric symptoms at the time of pre-operative assessment. The importance of patient-provider contact in supporting weight management was demonstrated in the Weight Loss Maintenance trial (Svetkey et al., 2008). In this randomized control trial, adults who had completed an initial behaviourally-based weight loss program were randomized to 1 of 3 weight-loss maintenance groups: 1) monthly individual contact with an interventionist; 2) unlimited access to an interactive Web site; or 3) a self-directed control group. Although the personal contact and interactive technology groups received similar information (e.g., recommendations to self-monitor, motivational interviewing), at the end of the 30-month follow-up period, those in the personal contact group had regained significantly less weight than those in the other two groups. Such reports provide an empirical foundation for recurrent and long-term post-operative follow-up of bariatric surgery to monitor the development or resurgence of maladaptive behaviours. Pre- and post-operative intervention. In cases where patients present with clinically significant psychopathology, there is an increasing role for clinicians and researchers to develop and adapt psychological interventions to suit the needs of bariatric patients. To date, no randomized controlled trials of psychotherapy have been conducted amongst bariatric surgery patients. However, in a pre-post intervention design, Ashton, Drerup, Windover, and Heinberg (2009) found that a 4-session pre-operative CBT group led to significant reductions in binge eating behaviours in 243 bariatric surgery patients. A description of session content has been provided by Ashton and colleagues (2009) and includes behavioural (e.g., self-monitoring) and cognitive strategies (e.g., cognitive restructuring), and material that was specific to bariatric patients (e.g., post-operative expectations, communicating with healthcare providers). In a 78

follow-up study (Ashton, Heinberg, Windover, & Merrell, 2011), a subset of participants (N = 128) who completed the CBT trial were categorized as "responders" and "non-responders" based on their post-intervention subjective binge eating episodes and Binge Eating Scale scores (Gormally, Black, Daston, & Rardin, 1982). At 6- and 12-months after surgery, participants classified as responders had lost significantly more of their excess body weight, suggesting that the strategies learned in the brief pre-operative intervention may have improved post-operative eating behaviours and subsequent weight loss. Leahey, Crowther, and Irwin (2008) developed a 10-session mindfulness-based CBT group intervention for binge eating, which was delivered post-operatively and tailored for bariatric patients (e.g., strategies addressed awareness of physiological hunger and satiety cues, pacing of food consumption, acceptance of post-operative results). The intervention was grounded in cognitive-behavioural principles and supplemented with mindfulness-based strategies that encouraged awareness and acceptance of emotions and physiological cues, and adaptive emotion regulation strategies. The authors note that, given the high rates of depression in bariatric patients, treatment strategies that targeted disordered eating (e.g., cognitive restructuring) were simultaneously applied to depressive symptomatology. Overall, results indicated improvements in binge eating behaviour from pre- to post-treatment, decreases in depression, and improvements in emotion regulation across the six DERS subscales. At present, it is premature to draw conclusions about the role of emotion regulation difficulties in predicting psychopathology among bariatric surgery patients. However, if additional research supports the finding that specific difficulties in emotion regulation predict current mood and anxiety disorders and psychiatric comorbidity, this would have implications for the development and refinement of psychosocial interventions. Preliminary results from 79

Ashton and colleague's (2009) and Leahey and colleague's (2008) intervention studies are promising and suggest the feasibility and effectiveness of two brief CBT protocols tailored for bariatric patients. It is particularly notable that Leahey and colleague's (2008) mindfulnessbased CBT intervention designed to reduce eating pathology led to a concurrent improvement in depressive symptoms, possibly via improvements in emotion regulation difficulties. Similarly, according to data compiled in a pilot study at the Toronto Western Hospital Bariatric Surgery Program, a six-session CBT intervention for overeating behaviour was effective in reducing eating pathology and improving depressive symptoms (Cassin, Sockalingam, Wnuk, Strimas, Royal, & Parikh, in review). As in Leahey and colleague's (2008) study, Cassin and colleagues (in review) recognized that many of the CBT strategies used to address eating pathology in this protocol (e.g., identifying and challenging counterproductive thoughts, increasing pleasurable activities, problem-solving, self-care) could be applied to concurrent depressive symptoms. In addition to protocols that principally target disordered eating, given the range of psychopathologies reported by bariatric patients and high levels of comorbid psychopathology, it may also be worthwhile to explore the utility and feasibility of transdiagnostic protocols, which are hypothesized to target common underlying mechanisms across emotional disorders. The Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders, developed by Barlow et al. (2011), is one CBT approach that aims to address the core features of emotional disorders (defined as all anxiety and unipolar mood disorders). Briefly, the Unified Protocol is comprised of eight modules with five modules specifically designed to target difficulties in emotion regulation (e.g., emotional awareness training, development of adaptive behavioural responses to intense emotions). Overall, the protocol emphasizes the adaptive and functional nature of emotions, promotes tolerance of intense emotions, and seeks to identify and correct an 80

individual's maladaptive use of emotion regulation strategies (see Wilamowska et al., 2010 for a brief review of the protocol development and treatment components). To date, few studies have examined the effectiveness of the Unified Protocol, although two studies provide evidence of significant reductions in symptom severity for patients' principal psychiatric diagnosis, depression, anxiety, and negative affect, which were maintained at six-month follow-up (Ellard, Fairholme, Boisseau, Farchione, & Barlow, 2010; Farchione, Fairholme, Ellard, ThompsonHollands, & Barlow, 2010). As previously noted, the benefit of a transdiagnostic approach is that it is pragmatic and parsimonious: clinicians would need training on one set of therapeutic principles only to address mood and anxiety psychopathology and comorbid presentations, which would increase dissemination of the treatment (Wilamowska et al., 2010). However, there are unique challenges in delivering any psychosocial treatment to bariatric surgery patients, which must be considered. First, in light of the number of program requirements placed on patients (e.g., interdisciplinary assignments, medical examinations, obtaining test results), clinicians will need to consider the additional time commitment and potential burden that completion of a psychosocial treatment would place on patients. In that respect, a consensus will need to be made regarding whether the treatment is mandatory or optional, and whether the treatment is best completed before or after surgery. Second, bariatric surgery patients often travel long distances to their assessment and surgical site(s) (range of 2 to 1734 kilometres, according to data compiled at Toronto Western Hospital) and many have significant issues with mobility, which are practical barriers to treatment. Accordingly, additional modes of therapy, including telephone and online approaches, will need to be considered. Third, as clinicians and researchers have recognized (Ashton et al., 2009; Cassin et al., in review; Leahey et al., 2008), it is of utmost importance that 81

the intervention concurrently target psychiatric symptoms and provide skills that help patients' prepare for, or adapt and adhere to, the post-operative lifestyle. Altogether, our findings suggest that further attention to emotion regulation difficulties in bariatric surgery patients might help to inform the development and refinement of psychosocial interventions. Current protocols might benefit from the integration of techniques thought to directly target emotion regulation skills. For instance, as in Leahey and colleague's (2008) study, mindfulness exercises can be a useful tool to increase patients' awareness of emotional responding or maladaptive emotion regulation strategies that are inconsistent with one's goals. Other interventions that address emotion regulation difficulties include dialectical behaviour therapy (Linehan, 1993; Wiser & Telch, 1999) and CBT (Barlow et al., 2004; Fairburn, 2008; Suveg et al., 2006). Unified protocols (e.g., Barlow et al., 2011) that use common therapeutic principles, protocols, and materials to target emotion regulation difficulties across psychiatric disorders may also be a treatment option, but more research is needed to determine if a transdiagnostic approach is feasible and effective. Conclusions In summary, the current study provides evidence that psychiatric disorders are prevalent in bariatric surgery patients, are associated with significantly worse quality of life, and have links with specific emotion regulation difficulties. Upon completion of a structured psychodiagnostic interview, roughly 1 in 2 bariatric surgery candidates met diagnostic criteria for a lifetime Axis I disorder and approximately 1 in 5 patients met diagnostic criteria for a current Axis I disorder. When these numbers are interpreted in the context of the growing number of obese individuals, and the increased popularity of bariatric surgery as a treatment option, the potential for psychological problems in surgical candidates is substantial. As discussed in this paper, bariatric 82

surgery is not contraindicated by psychiatric status per se, but researchers and clinicians alike have affirmed that the development of psychosocial interventions is an essential step to increasing the likelihood of a positive outcome after surgery. This paper concludes by suggesting that emotion regulation difficulties may be one parsimonious treatment target, as a specific difficulty engaging in goal-directed behaviour when experiencing negative emotions was a common and robust predictor of current mood and anxiety disorders, and psychiatric comorbidity. Further examinations are needed to replicate our findings and elucidate how difficulties in emotion regulation interact with psychopathology to affect post-operative outcomes. Altogether, such information represents an important step in determining standalone or adjunct treatment targets by which post-operative outcomes can be improved through psychosocial interventions.

Appendix C Logistic Regression: Tests of Assumptions and Diagnostic Statistics Prior to conducting the logistic regression analyses, assumptions regarding multicollinearity and linearity of the logit were examined for each model. Multicollinearity between the predictor variables was assessed according to tolerance and variance inflation factor (VIF) statistics, with tolerance values less than 0.1 (Menard, 1995) and VIF values greater than 10 (Myers, 1990) indicating violations of collinearity. The assumption of linearity was assessed by examining the interaction between each continuous predictor and its log transformation in two logistic regression analyses. Interactions that were statistically significant at p < .05 indicated a violation of this assumption (Hosmer & Lemeshow, 1989). In the model predicting current mood disorder status, tolerance values ranged from .31 to .51 and VIF statistics ranged from 1.97 to 3.22, indicating that assumptions regarding multicollinearity were satisfied. Next, we examined whether the interactions between the GOALS, STRATEGIES, and CLARITY subscales of the DERS and their respective log transformations were significantly associated with current mood disorder status. Results revealed that the three interactions were not statistically significant (all ps > .05), indicating that the assumption of linearity of the logit was met. These procedures were repeated for the second regression model predicting current anxiety disorder status. An examination of the collinearity statistics showed that the tolerance value was .51 and VIF statistic was 1.96 for the GOALS subscale, indicating that assumptions regarding multicollinearity were satisfied. Next, we examined whether the interaction between the GOALS subscale and its log transformation was significantly associated with current anxiety disorder status. Results showed that the interaction

87

was not statistically significant (p > .05), indicating that the assumption of linearity of the logit was satisfied. To test whether each regression model fit the observed data well or was influenced by a small number of cases, we next examined the data for outliers and influential cases. In the model predicting current mood disorder status, 6 cases had standardized residuals above 3.29, suggesting possible outliers. An initial examination of these cases did not reveal errors in data input or scoring. In addition, results of the regression model did not change with or without the outliers present, suggesting the model was not biased by these cases. Examination of the residual statistics (Cook's distance, leverage, and DFBeta values) indicated there were no influential cases having an effect on the model predicting current mood disorder status. Specifically, all 321 cases had Cook's distance values less than 1, DFBetas less than 1, and leverage statistics very close to the expected value of 0.019 for the model. In the second model predicting current anxiety disorder status, 13 cases had standardized residuals above 3.29, suggesting possible outliers. Inspection of these cases did not show errors in data input or scoring. In addition, results of the regression model did not change with or without the outliers present, suggesting the model was not biased by these cases. Examination of the residual statistics indicated there were no influential cases having an effect on the model. Specifically, all 321 cases had Cook's distance values less than 1, DFBetas less than 1, and leverage statistics very close to the expected value of 0.009 for the model. In summary, assumptions regarding linearity and the absence of multicollinearity were met, and residual statistics indicated that the regression models fit the observed data well, so we were confident in proceeding with the logistic regression analyses.

88

Appendix D Linear Regression: Tests of Assumptions and Diagnostic Statistics Prior to conducting the linear regression analysis to evaluate whether greater difficulties in emotion regulation predicted a greater number of current Axis I disorders, assumptions regarding multicollinearity and homoscedasticity were examined for the model. Multicollinearity between the predictor variables was assessed according to bivariate correlation coefficients, and tolerance and VIF statistics, with correlations above .80 or .90 (Field, 2009), tolerance values less than 0.1 (Menard, 1995), and VIF values greater than 10 (Myers, 1990) indicating violations of collinearity. The assumption of homoscedasticity (i.e., that the variance of scores is roughly equal at different points on the predictor variables) was assessed using Levene's test (Levene, 1960), with a statistically significant test (p < .05) indicating that the assumption of homogeneity of variance was violated. Results indicated that none of the DERS subscales correlated above .80 or .90, tolerance values ranged from .31 to .61, and VIF statistics ranged from 1.64 to 3.19, indicating that assumptions regarding multicollinearity were satisfied. Next, the assumption of homogeneity of variance for each of the DERS subscales was examined. Results revealed that Levene's test was not statistically significant (all ps > .05), indicating that the assumption of homogeneity of variance was met. To test whether the linear regression model fit the observed data well or was influenced by a small number of cases, we next examined the data for outliers and influential cases. Results indicated that 1 case had a standardized residual above 3.29, suggesting the presence of an outlier. An initial examination of this case did not reveal errors in data input or scoring. In addition, results of the linear regression model did not change with or without the outlier present, 89

suggesting the model was not biased by this case. Examination of the residual statistics (Cook's distance, leverage, and DFBeta values) indicated there were no influential cases having an effect on the model. Specifically, all 321 cases had Cook's distance values less than 1, DFBetas less than 1, and leverage statistics very close to the expected value of 0.022 for the model. In summary, assumptions regarding multicollinearity and homoscedasticity were met, and residual statistics indicated that the regression model fit the observed data well, so we were confident in proceeding with the linear regression analysis.
