Abstract
THE EFFECT OF LFC PROCESS VARIABLES ON SOLIDIFICATION AND THERMAL RESPONSE OF AZ91E MAGNESIUM ALLOY CASTINGS
© L u k as B ichler, 2004 M aster o f Applied Science In the program o f M echanical Engineering Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 2005 M agnesium alloys are gaining in popularity as materials o f choice for automotive and aerospace applications. M agnesium alloys have the lowest density o f all structural metals, effectively making their specific properties highly attractive. Lost Foam Casting (LFC) is a novel near-net-shape manufacturing process utilizing expanded polystyrene (EPS) as a mold filler. Presence o f the EPS in the casting cavity promotes formation o f unique casting defects. These include misruns, folds, entrapped polystyrene pyrolysis products and potentially increased levels o f gas porosity. There is very little published literature on the feasibility o f casting magnesium alloys by the LFC process. This research was an attempt to evaluate the effect o f selected LFC process variables on AZ91E magnesium alloy castings produced by the LFC process. In this work, the effect o f melt superheat, casting section thickness, EPS foam properties and the application o f vacuum during mold filling were investigated and correlated to the casting quality and m olten m etal flow behavior. Further, detailed thermal analysis was carried out to determine the solidification history o f the castings. The results o f the thermal analysis were used to determme the effect o f the cooling rate on the developm ent o f the casting microstructure. M oreover, the morphology and the mode o f second phase (M gnA li:) precipitation were studied and quantified. T he results suggest that application o f vacuum during the mold filling process increased the metal flow lengths. However, the casting soundness deteriorated due to the applied vacuum. Variations in the density o f the vacuum cast horizontal bars were explained through the presence o f partially solidified metal. The molten metal flow was further influenced by the foam density and the bead fusion. Greater flow lengths w ere observed in the high density 1.6 p c f foam castings. In the low density 1.3 p c f foam castings, numerous casting defects w ere associated with the presence o f the liquid-EPS pyrolysis products. In general, the thermal analysis suggested that non-equilibrium alloy solidification prom oted the formation o f the lamellar non-equilibrium M g n A ln precipitate, and this was confirmed by optical microscopy. iv

Chapter 1 --Introduction
M agnesium alloys are increasingly used for innovative applications in the automotive and aerospace industries. Primarily, they are employed with the goal o f reducing overall vehicular w eight and exhaust emissions, thus enabling more efficient vehicles. Advantages o f magnesium alloys stem mainly from their lov/ density. In addition to their specific strength, they have excellent ductility and energy absorption capacity. Casting is the primary manufacturing process for these alloys. However, consistent mold filling and defect-free solidification rem ain as challenges in the production o f magnesium castings.

Lost Foam Casting (LFC) is a novel and innovative casting process enabling production o f complex castings. Further, the cost o f production o f these castings by the LFC process is much less relative to the conventional processes, such as sand casting. Over the past 20 --25 years, almost 30% o f the die cast components have come to be produced by the LFC process. M ajor strides in the LFC o f cast irons and aluminum alloys are attributed to significant research and development endeavors o f the automotive industry. M uch o f these are in the development o f new polymers, bead expansion techniques, selection o f favorable alloys and parameters. Thus, scientific data related to superheats, heat transfer, flow length, etc. are available to a reasonable extent for LFC o f cast irons and aluminum alloys.

T he phenomenal growth in LFC o f cast irons and aluminum alloys has not resulted in a concomitant growth in the LFC o f magnesium alloys. In fact, there is very little published research on foam casting o f magnésium alloys. Thus, the process data for LFC o f magnesium alloys are yet to be developed. In this research, the AZ91E magnesium alloy was selected due to its overall superior properties -- castability, mechanical strength and ductility, relative to other magnesium alloys. The aim o f this w ork was to manipulate superheat, mold pressure, casting geometry and foam properties to ensure production o f complete castings o f good quality.

In addition, computer aided thermal analysis was carried out for the solidification o f magnesium alloy castings produced by the LFC process. The casting section thickness, application o f vacuum and melt superheat were correlated to the casting quality, solidification characteristics and ensuing alloy microstructure. Development o f the M gi?Ali 2 precipitate in the casting m icrostructure was also investigated.

Chapter 2 --Literature Review
In this chapter, there is a general description o f the lost foam casting process, followed by an introduction to magnesium alloys and their solidification behavior. M icrostructural developm ent and precipitation m odes in magnesium alloys are explained. Thermal analysis and numerical methods used to evaluate experimental data are discussed.

2.1 Lost Foam Casting

L ost Foam Casting (LFC) is a full mold casting process with expandable polystyrene (EPS) foam as the m old filler.^ This novel casting process is a viable alternative to the established casting processes, such as sand casting and high-pressure die casting. Extensive research continues to be carried out w ith the view to understanding the effect o f LFC process parameters on the resulting casting quality.^ General acceptance o f the LFC process by the industry is dependent on the foundry's ability to manufacture high-integrity castings o f high quality.

In the LFC process, the foam pattern is an exact replica o f the casting to be produced. The foam pattern can be either molded to shape or it can be assembled by cutting foam slabs into pieces and then gluing individual pieces together. In the latter case, hot melt glue is used to jo in the foam pieces together.

The assembled pattern is coated w ith a ceramic refractory slurry, which prevents metal penetration to the surrounding sand during mold filling. Further, the ceramic coating also influences the rate o f the foam pyrolysis products rem oval from the casting cavity to the surrounding sand.

A fter coating, the pattern is placed into a casting flask and loose unbonded sand is poured around it. The m old is then compacted using a vibrating table. The mold vibration is monitored to ensure sand mold integrity for all casting sections.

A fter compaction o f the sand, molten metal is poured directly into the foam pattern, thus initiating pyrolysis o f the EPS pattern. M olten metal eventually replaces all o f the foam, thus creating a replica o f the original foam pattern assembly.

M old filling and production o f internally sound castings are influenced by numerous casting parameters. Foam characteristics, metal pouring temperature, mold medium and coating properties m ust be controlled to allow proper feeding o f the molten metal to the casting cavity. In order to prevent solidification shrinkage, risers may be used. These risers are not a part o f the actual casting; however, they are designed to be the last segments o f the casting assembly to solidify. Consequently, they provide liquid metal to the adjacent sections o f the solidifying casting. Figure 1 shows a typical casting system, including risers, gates and multiple feeding sprues.

Figure I: Typical casting system.^ A t this point, there is no published research with a unique focus on understanding and optimizing the LFC process for magnesium alloys. Initial research on the LFC o f magnesium alloys has been limited to minor modification o f the known aluminum LFC process. However, the therm o-physical properties o f magnesium alloys are different from those o f aluminum alloys. As a result, magnesium alloys were not cast with reasonable success. Ideally, an optimized LFC process for magnesium alloys will enable manufacture o f castings with the following qualities:''

1. Adequate strength and ductility to compete with other light metal castings for a variety o f applications. 2. The best possible mechanical properties for particular high-temperature applications (up to and above the temperature o f relatively rapid oxidation o f magnesium in air, 400 °C). 3

3.

Minimum macro- and micro-porosity and freedom from hot-cracking, in order to maintain strength and pressure tightness.

4. 5.

Satisfactory surface finish. Wide variety o f shapes and section sizes.

W ith respect to the above criteria, magnesium ailoys pose a difficult challenge as they tend to solidify rapidly, thus producing incomplete castings. Therefore, a major challenge to successful casting production is the mold filling portion o f the casting process.

2.2 Mold filling and fluidity

The term fluidity is defined as the ability o f a liquid metal to fill the mold cavity.^ Usually, fluidity,

L f,

is

determined by the length o f a solidified metal in the casting.^ Fluidity is a com plex property and is affected by a number o f variables, such as the alloy's latent heat, surface tension, viscosity and density, as well as the alloy's freezing range.^

A lloy fluidity governs the filling rate o f the mold. Good alloy fluidity allows filling o f the intricate parts o f a complex casting. Alloys w ith a w ide freezing range usually have reduced fluidity and have a tendency to deliver partially solidified metal to the casting, whereas pure m etals and alloys o f eutectic composition are less viscous, flow further than non-eutectic alloys and reproduce details more accurately. In the case o f magnesium and its alloys, the variation o f enthalpy between the liquid and the solid phase is relatively small. Consequently, less energy needs to be dissipated during solidification o f magnesium alloys, which results in their rapid freezing, shorter solidification times and shorter metal flow lengths.^ Table 1 compares the enthalpy values for pure M g and Al metals. Table 1: Thermal properties o f pure and A 19.10 E n th a lp y p e r u n it volum e E n th a lp y o f fusion L iq u id density [kJ/kg] Pure Magnesium Pure Aluminum 368 397 [kg/ra^] 1610 2550 [MJ/m^J 592 1012

Fluidity in the LFC process is affected by the endothermie foam degradation reactions, which occur at the molten m etal front.'' The nature o f these reactions may depend on the geometry o f the interface between the molten metal front and the region where the solid-EPS degradation occurs.'^

Further, fluidity is affected by the casting section thickness. It was well established

that thinner

casting sections promote higher solidification rates. This is due to the fact that the chilling effect o f the relatively cold sand mold diminishes with increasing casting modulus. (Casting modulus is defined as the volume to area ratio o f the casting, Y JA c.Y

The enthalpy o f the liquid metal (a function o f pouring temperature) is also known to directly affect the alloy fluidity.^ A superheated metal remains liquid for a longer period o f time, thus allowing improved casting fill. (Superheat is defined as the temperature difference between actual pouring tem perature and the liquidus temperature o f a particular alloy.)

Pan and L iao'^ attempted to synthesize the influence o f superheat and other LFC casting variables into one mathematical model, viz.. 'H 2 L ,P r KPl

This model w as validated for aluminum LFC. However, past research

suggests that this model cannot

be readily adapted for predicting flow length o f magnesium alloys cast by the LFC process. A s Equation 1 does not account for the oscillatory nature o f the metal flow during mold filling, the calculated results typically overestimated the actual metal flow lengths.

Chvorinov

suggested a relationship between the solidification time and the casting geometry:

tj- -- k W here: tf = Local solidification time Vc = Casting volume Ac = Casting surface area k = Chvorinov's constant n = Chvorinov's exponent

(2)

Shivkumar

and Okorafor

stated that Chvorinov's rule may not be readily applicable to LFC o f

aluminum alloys, since this model does not account for the energy loss required to degrade the solid-EPS foam. The applicability o f this rule for magnesium alloys, however, has never been investigated.

2.2.1 E ffect o f vacuum

Often, metal flow in the mold is enhanced by the application o f a vacuum (i.e., a negative pressure). However, this is not practical for all m anufacturing processes and may lead to undesired casting surface defects, such as mold penetration.

In general, for moderate levels o f vacuum, the metal flow length increases w ith increasing degree o f applied vacuum. This can be seen from the w ork o f Liu et. al in Figure 2.

Strong interactive effects o f vacuum, pouring tem perature and the coating thickness were found in Liu's Work. Liu et. al. studied the effect o f the vacuum gradient on the casting fillability from the points o f the metal front profile, the rate o f pyrolysis products removal and the heat transfer.

2.2.1.1 Effect o f vacuum on the metal front profile Application o f a vacuum establishes a pressure gradient from the pattern w alls through the coating to the unbonded sand m old.'' This causes the liquid metal to advance preferentially against the mold walls. The associated change o f the metal front profile (from convex to concave) has a great influence on the overall mold filling process. A t low vacuum levels, fluidity increases w ith an increase in the applied vacuum. This is due to the fact th at a small pressure gradient changes the curvature o f th e metal front only slightly (Figure 4). As a result, the foam pattern decomposition products at the m etal-foam interface can be effectively and easily rem oved from the casting cavity.

Figure 4: Metalfront profile fo r a low-vacuum level. W ith a further increase in the degree o f vacuum, the metal front at the pattern w all wi ll extend more along the mold walls, as shown in Figure 5. Thus, the decomposition products at the center o f the flow channel may get entrapped in the casting. Further, the degradation products will require a longer path to reach the metal-mold interface, consequently hindering the metal flow.

Figure 5: Metalfront profile fo r an intermediate vacuum level. W hen the vacuum level exceeds a critical value, the metal at the pattern walls w ill be well ahead o f the metal at the channel center, as seen in Figure 6. In this case, the decomposition products accumulated at the center o f the casting channel will greatly impede the metal flow. Furthermore, as greater surface area o f the liquid metal is exposed to the solid-EPS, higher heat extraction rates from the molten metal are likely to occur. Thus, the molten metal will experience higher cooling rates with attendant rapid solidification.

2.2.1.2 Effect o f vacuum on the pyrolysis products removal rate Since the typical pouring temperatures o f magnesium alloys are relatively low, the EPS pattern decomposition products are prim arily liquid.^^ As a result, the gap between the metal front and the receding polystyrene foam may be narrow. Conversely, if the pouring temperature was high, the interface gap would be wider due to the formation o f additional gaseous pyrolysis products.

The liquid-EPS products leave the hot metal surface and travel to the relatively cooler coating and much cooler surrounding sand. It is possible that a fraction o f the liquid polystyrene begins to harden when

the liquid pyrolysis products pass through the refractory coating. Such a phenomenon reduces the coating's permeability and impedes the removal o f additional pyrolysis products. Application o f vacuum can delay or reduce the possibility o f such clogging o f the refractory coating pores by assisting the transport o f the liquid-EPS products through the coating into the surrounding sand.

2J2J -3 Effect o f vacuum on the heat transfer Applying vacuum during mold filling influences the overall heat transfer from the molten metal to the surroundings. First, it influences the heat transfer rate. Secondly, it affects the heat transfer m ode.'^

The rate at which EPS pyrolysis products are extracted to the surrounding sand affects the molten metal front chill time. The chill time in turn affects the rate o f heat transfer from the molten metal. The chilling occurs due to the contact o f the molten metal front with the EPS pyrolysis products. Faster transfer o f pyrolysis products from the casting cavity as a result o f applied vacuum may reduce the cooling rate experienced by the metal.

In conventional casting processes, heat conduction is the primary mode o f heat transfer. However, if vacuum is applied during mold filling, heat transfer due to convection may further contribute to the overall heat transfer rate. Therefore, the solidification rate may increase due to a potential gas flow inside o f the mold. Further, the overall heat transfer rate may increase in proportion to the degree o f vacuum applied, as higher vacuum levels would draw more gas into the mold.

2.3 M agnesium alloys

For many technological applications, magnesium may be suitably alloyed to obtain the required strength, ductility, workability, corrosion resistance and castability/^

Solid solubility o f one metal in another depends on several factors. M ost importantly, both alloying elements should have the same crystal structure. In addition, similarities in atomic size, chemical affinity and electron valency are also imperative to efficient alloying.'^

Numerous alloying combinations are possible w ith magnesium alloys to achieve the targeted properties. Zinc is added to improve the room tem perature strength and fluidity. Silicon is added to improve creep strength o f the alloys by forming M giSi particles on the grain boundaries. A ddition o f manganese is required to control the corrosion behavior.^® However, the most commercially used m agnesium alloys are those based on the m agnesium (M g) - aluminum (Al) system.

Aluminum is often added to im prove castability. This is achieved by a decrease o f the freezing range and an increase o f the effective superheat. In addition, aluminum improves room temperature tensile properties due to the solid solution strengthening and formation o f the M g n A l , 2 precipitate. However, at temperatures above 150 °C, the beneficial effects o f aluminum appear to dim inish because o f the microstructural instabilities resulting from either coarsening or re-precipitation o f the M g n A l^ phase from the supersaturated magnesium grains.^'

2.3.1 Effect o f aluminum

M ost o f the commercial magnesium alloys belong to the binary magnesium-aluminum group (disregarding small amounts o f manganese and zinc). The solubility curve o f the binary Mg-Al alloys displaces only slightly when either manganese or zinc is added. Thus, for most commercial magnesium alloys, the Mg-Al binary phase diagram, Figure 7, adapted from Beck predicting equilibrium phase development. serves as an accurate means o f

In addition, aluminum content in excess o f 15 wt% results in the formation o f dendritic microstructure.^^ These dendrites nucleate from the prim ary magnesium grains, while the interdendritic regions are composed o f the lamellar eutectic M gnA ln phase.

2.4 Development o f the m icrostructure

The concept o f solidification comprises two basic phenomena: 1) nucléation, and 2) growth o f crystals from the liquid melt. By low ering the tem perature o f the m elt below its equilibrium liquidus temperature, the solid phase becomes the therm odynam ically stable form o f matter, and a transform ation from liquid to solid is initiated. The rate o f the " liquid -> solid" transformation depends on the rate o f heat extraction from the system.^^

During dendritic solidification o f castings, several processes take place during alloy's cooling through the semisolid (or mushy) region. These processes include nucléation, crystallization, ripening, interdendritic fluid flow and solid movement. The resulting dendritic structure is greatly affected by the cooling conditions during the early stages o f solidification.^'*

Since M g has a hexagonal-close-packed (HCP) crystal structure, dendrite arms may branch with a six fold symmetiy. Well developed prim ary a-M g dendrites with secondary arms are seen in Figure 10. The growth o f the Mg dendrites is sustained by the need to maintain chemical equilibrium in the alloy. In this process, solute is rejected ahead o f the growing dendrites.^^

The maximum solid solubility for aluminum (solute) in magnesium (solvent) at the eutectic temperature is 12.7 wt%Al. A Mg/MgiyAliz eutectic appears at about 33 wt%Al. The m ajority o f the Mg-Al commercial alloys have Al content below the maximum solid solubility and are hypoeutectic alloys. Ideally, these alloys solidify w ith a prim ary a-M g phase and a subsequent precipitation o f the M g n A l^ phase from the M g-Al soiid-solution. However, due to non-equilibrium cooling conditions, the M g n A l^ rnetastable eutectic develops during solidification and remains in the as-cast microstructure.^®

2.4.1 Equilibrium solidification

The binary M g-Al diagram can be used to elucidate the equilibrium solidification o f the AZ91 alloys. Figure 11 shows the magnesium-rich end o f the phase diagram, w ith a dashed line indicating the composition o f the AZ91 alloy.

Figure 11: Mg-rich end o f the Mg-Al binary phase diagram. 20 The AZ91 alloy starts to solidify at the liquidus temperature o f 595 °C and solidification is complete at the solidus temperature o f 470 °C.® The M g-rich section o f the binary phase diagram shows a maximum solid solubility o f 12.7 wt% Al at the eutectic temperature o f 437 "C. U nder equilibrium conditions, the M g-Al alloy should initially solidify as a single phase a-M g solid solution. Further cooling should lead to the solid-state precipitation o f the p-phase within the a-grains.^®

As evidenced by the microstructure o f as-cast M g-Al alloys, equilibrium solidification almost never takes place. The presence o f the metastable eutectic in the as-cast microstructure o f virtually all commercial M g-Al alloys suggests that equilibrium solidification was not followed.^*^

14

2.4.2 Non-equilibrium solidification

Non-equilibrium solidification begins w ith the nucléation o f prim ary a-M g grains in the temperature range o f 600 °C --650 °C, depending on the aluminum content.

T he lamellar eutectic phase (M guA ln) is expected to appear when the aluminum content reaches 33 wt%Al. However, the eutectic phase appears in magnesium alloys containing as little as 2 wt%Al. Therefore, the presence o f the M gnA hz phase in the microstructure is attributed to the non-equilibrium solidification, which causes shifting o f the solidus and liquidus lines o f the equilibrium phase diagram.^®

A s solidification progresses, the liquid between respective magnesium dendrites (or grains) becomes enriched w ith solute due to solute rejection (i.e., solute segregation). Solute rejection is the result o f the unequal solute diffusion rates in the solid and the liquid phases o f the solvent material. Consequently, phases which solidify in the later stages o f the solidification process, such as the M g n A ln eutectic phase, are pushed between the dendrite arms and / or between the magnesium grains. The exact location o f the secondary phase depends on the chronological state o f the solidification process. As the alloy continues to cool, crystals o f hypoeutectic M g-Al solid solution increase in size, with each layer o f atoms added to the crystal surface being richer in aluminum than the preceding one. W hen the temperature o f 470 °C is reached (at which freezing would be complete according to the equilibrium phase diagram) the crystals composition ranges from 1.5 wt% Al at the grain center to approximately 9 wt% Al at the grain surface.

T he aluminum concentration in the inter-dendritic regions gradually decreases since some o f the aluminum atoms react to form the M gi 7 A l , 2 phase. The peak in the aluminum concentration occurs at the instant before the M g n A l^ phase precipitates. When the temperature reaches 437 °C, the aluminum concentration at the dendrite edge reaches its maximum o f 12.7 wt%Al, which is about 8.5 tim es that in the dendrite center

Therefore, the distribution o f the solute within the magnesium grains is highly heterogeneous. Further, the departure from equilibrium, caused by the high cooling rates, also affects the M gi 7 A li 2 phase morphology.

15

2.4.3 Mgi7Âl}2 phase morphology

The M gi 7A li 2 phase exhibits a wide range o f morphologies, depending on the alloy composition and cooling conditions. The morphology may progressively change from fully divorced to partially divorced, ^ a n u la r, fibrous, and finally, to a lam ellar structure.^® The effect o f the cooling rate and the solute content on the M gnAliz morphology is illustrated in Figure 12.

A lloy cooling rates associated with the conventional casting processes are generally too high to allow equilibrium phase development. Consequently, casting solidification departs from equilibrium

predictions, with attendant change in the a-M g and the M g n A l^ phase morphologies. A study on the effect o f the alloy cooling rate on the casting microstructure identified several mechanisms o f m anipulating the casting microstructure via the cooling rate.^* These are:

1. It w ill change the prim ary magnesium dendrite morphology, which determines the size o f the interdendritic regions. Hence, a geometrical constraint on the region where the M g n A ln phase can grow is established. Alternatively, variation o f the cooling rate affects the num ber o f sites at w hich the M g n A l^ phase nucléation may occur. 2. Increasing the cooling rate will lead to lower solute contents in the dendrites. 3. It w ill modify the gradient o f the solute distribution in the liquid ahead o f the growing dendrites and therefore the composition profile at the tim e o f the eutectic transformation. 4. It w ill increase the degree o f thermal undercooling before nucléation o f the M g n A l , 2 phase occurs.

In summary, the cooling rate m ay dictate the size, shape and distribution o f the M gnA li 2 phase in the final microstructure.

W hen nucléation o f the M gi 7 A li 2 phase begins, a halo o f this phase deposits on the prim ary magnesium dendrites. I f the cooling rate is slow and the eutectic region is sufficiently large, formation o f the I^g n A li 2 halo consumes any rejected solute ahead o f the solid-liquid interface. Therefore, chemical equilibrium is re-established.^® In unison with this process, formation o f a divorced eutectic or a partially divorced eutectic may occur.

17

2.4.3.1 Fully divorced eutectic A fijlly divorced eutectic morphology is identified by the two eutectic phases (a-M g and (B-MgnAln) forming separately in the microstructure. Each interdendritic region consists o f a single M gnA ha particle surrounded by the eutectic a-M g, as seen in Figure 13.

p(Mgi7Alii)

Figure 13: Fully divorced eutectic microstructure. 20 High cooling rates associated w ith metalcasting result in rapid grain nucléation. Therefore, the interdendritic regions may become isolated from one another. In such cases, the thermal undercooling required for the M giyAl^ phase nucléation is greater than the undercooling required for the M gnAliz particle growth. Consequently, the M gi 7 A li 2 phase solidifies preferentially with a fully divorced morphology.^®

2.4.3.2 Partially divorced eutectic A partially divorced eutectic morphology forms under slow cooling conditions and is characterized by islands o f eutectic a-M g within the M g^A liz phase, as seen in Figure 14.

P(Mgi7AIiij

Figure 14: Partially divorced eutectic microstructure. 20 18

During the last stages o f solidification, the am ount o f developed eutectic phase and its mechanism o f formation may affect the mass feeding o f the alloy. Independent nucléation and growth o f the M gnA ln phase in the interdendritic liquid is likely to increase the surface area to volume ratio o f the feeding channels, thus decreasing the alloy fluidity. On the contrary, concomitant nucléation o f the M gnA ln phase on the a-M g grains and the subsequent growth towards the centre o f the interdendritic channels m ay allow the feeding paths to remain open for longer periods o f time, thus enhancing alloy fluidity

M ass feeding during eutectic solidification is also affected by the smoothness o f the solid-liquid interface during eutectic growth (i.e., if one o f the phases is growing ahead o f the other phase during coupled growth). A n isothermal, smooth, interface prom otes easier mass feeding. An interlace in w hich one o f the phases grows with a considerable lead over the other phase would require feeding along increasingly narrower and convoluted paths.^° Therefore, the morphology o f the M g n A l^ eutectic phase is possibly an additional parameter affecting the alloy fluidity.

2--.4-3.3 M orphology o f the M gnA ln phase T he morphology o f the eutectic phase is very sensitive to changes in the alloy com position and cooling conditions. Different morphologies were observed in the same alloy cast under similar conditions or even m nearby regions o f the same casting.^^ The predominance o f the fully or partially divorced morphologies IS mainly a function o f the volume fraction o f the primary magnesium dendrites, which consequently restrict the eutectic solidification to the interdendritic regions

The M gnAlia phase has a body-centered-cubic (BCC) crystal structure and has been reported to form Al plates on the (000 !),, habit plane.^® The M givAln phase is often found in the form o f a eutectoid structure, precipitated from the solid state. The eutectoid lamellae may follow the ctystallographic growth directions o f the magnesium HCP crystal structure. Therefore, there may be six growth directions equally prominent along which the M gnA li 2 forms. In the case o f coarse-grained castings, the lamellae appear to be inclined to each other at a definite angle. On correct positioning o f the HCP crystal in the plane o f polish, this angle is 60 or 120°. It is also possible that the M g n A l^ precipitate alternatively forms on the HCP pyramidal plane (1011) , which is the second most densely packed plane o f the eiystal.^*

19

Formation o f the lamellar eutectoid by deposition from the supersaturated solid solution is also possible?^ A fter a heat treatm ent at 400 °C, the M g n A l^ phase may enter slowly into the solution, w hile the grain boundaries loose their form. Figure 15 and Figure 16 show this phenomenon.

Figure 15: Eutectoid precipitation in the Mg-6wt%Al alloy (xl75). 31

Figure 16: Same as Figure 15; homogenizedfo r 1 hr at 400 °C and slowly cooled (xl 75). 31

In unquenched Mg-Al alloys w ith over 6 wt%Al, eutectoid in the form o f lamellar precipitate forms due to the breakdown o f the supersaturated solid solution. Upon heating, the M g n A ln phase goes into solution in such a way that the lam ellae break up into short pieces and finally into rounded particles.^' The lamellar breakdown is illustrated in Figure 17.

A lamellar structure o f the M g^A liz phase is desired for good m echanical perform ance o f the alloy However, since this eutectic is metastable, heat treatment may result in a complete dissolution o f the ^gv7Ali2 phase with consequent loss o f strength?®

W hen the formation o f the eutectic phase is a secondary process, i.e., it is formed in a small amount w ithin the remaining interdendritic liquid, the typical lamellar symmetry degenerates. W hen only a small volume fraction o f eutectic liquid is present and the cooling rates are high, the eutectic phase forms as discrete large particles around the prim ary M g-Al solid solution.®

2 4 .3 .4 Precipitation o f the M gpAlj? phase Completion o f eutectic solidification does not necessarily m ark the end o f phase transform ations in the M g-Al alloys. When the cooling rate is sufficiently slow (typical o f sand-casting), precipitation m ay occur in the supersaturated areas o f the a-M g grains. Continuous, as well as discontinuous precipitation may be observed in some Mg-Al alloys.^® Here, strengthening is attributed to the lam ellar M gnA li 2 phase formed on the pyramidal or basal planes o f the a-M g matrix. The shape, orientation and distribution o f the precipitate particles are important factors in determining the strength o f the alloy

M agnesium alloys show generally three types o f precipitation behavior.^^ These are:

1. The rejection o f the equilibrium solute-rich phase with little or no crystallographic coherency w ith the matrix solid solution. Age hardening is negligible, although some dispersion hardening may result from the precipitate orientation. Mg-Al alloys show this behavior only for narrow compositional ranges and under specific solidification conditions. 2. The formation o f the non-equilibrium or transition precipitate which enjoys pronounced coherency with the soiid-solution matrix. This precipitate allows the developm ent o f true age hardening. 3. The simultaneous recrystallization and precipitation o f the equilibrium solute-rich phase at an advancing front throughout individual grains. This process is called "discontinuous precipitation" or "recrystallization reaction" .

21

In general, continuous and discontinuous type o f precipitation occurs simultaneously in commercial MgAl alloys. Research indicates that the characteristics o f the respective precipitates depends on several factors

1.

The discontinuous precipitation is predominant at lower aging temperatures. Above 300 °C, the continuous precipitate, however, is the m ajor type.

2.

With higher tem perature, longer time and lower aluminum content, the precipitate is coarser and the lamellar spacing o f the discontinuous precipitate increases.

3.

The continuous precipitate is oriented parallel to the (0001) plane and the [1120] growth direction o f the magnesium matrix.

4.

The ratio o f the continuous precipitate to the discontinuous precipitate is increased by the formation o f [1012] tw ins in the alloy before aging.

2.43.4.1 Morphology of the continuous precipitate
In continuous precipitation, the new phase precipitates uniformly throughout the m atrix and often exhibits a characteristic orientation relative to the parent phase. Furthermore, since lattice coherency usually prevails at the conjugate planes, the precipitates tend to assume a particular shape and lie in a specific orientation w ith respect to the matrix lattice. It is common to find the precipitates in the form o f plates lying parallel to low-index planes o f the matrix.^^ The continuous precipitation w ith a W idmanstaten (or crystallographically oriented) structure is depicted in Figure 18 (a).

2.4.3,4.2 Morphology o f the discontinuous precipitate
In discontinuous precipitation, the supersaturated matrix decomposes through a reaction involving the formation o f colonies o f a tw o-phase mixture, which grows behind a moving boundary, consuming the parent phase. The morphology m ost often consists o f altem ating lam ellae o f the precipitated phase and solute depleted matrix. In contrast to the continuous precipitation, during discontinuous precipitation, the m atrix recrystal lizes during the eutectic reaction and exhibits a discontinuity in composition and crystallographic orientation across the reaction front.

The bulk o f the precipitation in the M g-Al alloys occurs by discontinuous precipitation. This involves the growth o f the lamellar M g^A lia precipitate into the a-M g grains. The aluminum in the supersaturated dendrite tips detaches from the a-M g solid and forms M gjyAln lamellae, leaving the a-M g between the lamellae depleted in aluminum.^®

The discontinuous precipitation appears to form in the a-M g regions near the eutectic phase, as these regions have higher aluminum content.^ The discontinuous precipitate is illustrated in Figure 19.

However, w hen the A l-Zn ratio approaches unity, ternary M g-Al-Zn alloys cease to form the discontinuous precipitate.^

23

The effect o f the cooling rate on the formation o f the discontinuous precipitate was also stu d ied / As Figure 20 illustrates, rapidly solidified alloys exhibit relatively homogeneous dispersion o f the second phase. However, as Figure 21 suggests, slow cooling rates promote preferential precipitation o f the M gi 7 A li 2 phase near the grain boundaries/^

2.5 D efect form ation

Magnesium-aluminum alloys have a relatively wide freezing range. As a result, they are susceptible to a variety o f casting defects including segregation, porosity and hot tearing. Until now, alloy optimization to minimize porosity has not been undertaken to the same degree as it has been done for the traditional Al-Si

The microstructure in magnesium castings is highly non-uniform. M ost o f the intermetallic phase segregates to the last regions to solidify. Since castings are not heat-treatable, the phase and solute nonuniformity cannot be reduced by heat treatment.^' Therefore, it is vital to minimize casting defects in the as-cast condition o f the alloy.

2,5.1 Porosity

T he level o f porosity and its distribution within the casting are critical factors affecting casting quality Porosity manifests itself in various forms: massive shrinkage cavities, dispersed gas pores or macro- and micro-porosity.

The density o f the liquid AZ91E alloy is approximately 4% low er than that o f the solid alloy. Consequently, a casting will experience volumetric contraction during the solidification process. This volumetric contraction must be compensated for by a change in the outer contours o f the casting or by formation o f internal cavities, i.e., porosity. W hile the solidification shrinkage in pure metals and alloys w ith narrow solidification intervals commonly causes formation o f macroscopic cavities (located in the
40 last regions to solidify), alloys w ith long freezing ranges fend to form distributed microporosity.''

Solidification shrinkage and the evolution o f dissolved gas occur in unison and act collaboratively to form microporosity. As a result, mass feeding during the last stages o f solidification is an important factor affecting the volume fraction o f the casting porosity.^®

Porosity in the Mg-Al alloys was seen to correlate with the solute concentration in the alloy, as observed in Figure 22. The peak in the casting porosity at about 9 wt% Al was related to the w orst combination o f long mushy zone, poor interdendritic feeding and high eutectic volume fraction.^'' 25

2.5.1.1 Shrinkage porosity The main disadvantage o f the AZ91 magnesium alloys is their tendency to form shrinkage porosity. This type o f porosity, seen in Figure 23, results from solidification shrinkage that is not compensated for by feeding o f liquid metal to the interdendritic regions.'*' This defect significantly lowers the tensile strength, elongation and pressure tightness o f the casting. Im plementation o f chills and risers in a casting design may decrease the probability o f nucleating shrinkage cavities by effectively feeding liquid metal to the interdendritic regions during casting solidification.'*'

1 ho volume fraction o f shrinkage porosity may be further reduced by establishing directional

S5>!idtlication. During directional solidification, the alloy may solidify at the mold walls, w hile the center oi the flow channel remains open. The bulk flow ceases when the metal front sluggishness is significant enough to cause flow stoppage.'*^ Even though beneficial, directional solidification m ust be carefully controlled. Significant melt superheating is often employed to ensure delivery o f the m olten m etal to all sections o f the casting. This can result in overheating o f the mold walls, which causes them to remain hot over a longer periods o f time. Such non-uniform mold tem perature may be conducive to the formation o f shrinkage porosity in other areas o f the casting.^^

^ 5 .1 .2 Gas porosity Gas porosity in magnesium alloy castings is mainly attributed to the high solubility o f the hydrogen gas in îiquid magnesium. A s can be observed in Figure 24, magnesium alloys have a very high affinity to absorb hydrogen from the surroundings during melting operations. Further, owing to their low specific gravity and their tendency to oxidize in the liquid state, magnesium alloys are also prone to form gas bubbles filled with oxide skin.''^

Niyaraa, LCC and FI criterion functions, for example, were employed to predict microporosity levels in aluminum alloys cast by the LFC p ro c e s s .T h e s e functions showed reasonably good correlation 'vith experimental results; however, their suitability for magnesium alloys is unknown.

27

2.5.1.3 Solute seCTCgation and porosity In alloys where the volume fraction o f the eutectic is sufficiently high to form a continuous network along grain- and dendrite-boundaries, macroscopic flow o f the eutectic phase is possible. Therefore, the last regions to solidify may act as a feeder for the surrounding parts o f the casting. This results in a higher volume fraction o f micropores in these regions. Since the m oving liquid is enriched in the alloying elements, this mechanism also prom otes macrosegregation.` '°

Porosity in magnesium alloys was found to correlate with the distribution o f Al and Zn in the casting.''* This trend was attributed to the inverse segregation phenomenon. During inverse segregation, melt enriched in alloying elements is drawn outwards to the colder regions by the growing shrinkage cavities, causing an interdendritic flow. Such mechanism results in an interdendritic porous netw ork with regions depleted in Al and Zn.'"

2.5.1.4 Adam's Riser Equation A dam 's Riser Equation (A.R.E.) is based on the optimal relationship between the local solidification times o f the riser and the casting. This m odel correlates the volumes o f the riser and the casting to the surface areas o f the riser and the casting.'*'*

Where: Vr = Volume o f the riser Vc = Volume o f the casting Ar = Surface area o f the riser Ac = Surface area o f the casting P = Amount o f solidification contraction =

The amount o f solidification shrinkage is related to the geometry o f the casting via the V /V c and A /A c ratios. Based on Adam 's theory, a prediction line can be drawn on the V /V c vs. A /A c graph. The region below the A.R.E. line corresponds to castings w ith no porosity, w hile the region above the A.R.E. line corresponds to casting conditions where solidification shrinkage will occur (see Figure 39).

28

The solidification contraction, (3, is material specific. I f there is no solidification contraction, i.e., P = 0, then the density o f the liquid metal is the same as the density o f the solid metal. For all commercial metals, however, this is never the case.

The density o f the AZ91 series alloys at room tem perature is 1. 810 g/cm^.^ Deviations from this value can be attributed to the solidification mode associated with the various casting processes and casting geometry.

There are many techniques, such as the Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA), Diffraction Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) available for investigating solidification o f alloys. Unfortunately, these methods often prove to be inadequate for investigating the non-equilibrium solidification o f castings, since they are designed to measure only equilibrium properties.'*'®

Thermal analysis is a reliable technique to study solidification o f castings. Tile first step involves the recording o f the temperature data as the alloy cools through its freezing range. The second step is to plot the temperature versus time, which gives the cooling curve o f the alloy. Thermal analysis is the study and interpretation o f such cooling curves.'" Figure 26 is a sample cooling curve (obtained in this research) w ith its first derivative plot.

Parameters relating to the thermal analysis may be defined and used in further analysis o f the casting solidification process. The fundamental parameters are:

Local Solidification Time, LST (tf) --time required for the metal to cool from the liquidus to the nonequilibrium solidus tem perature.'^

Cooling Rate, CR (dT/dt) --rate o f tem perature drop between the liquidus and the solidus temperatures.

Solidus Velocity (Vs) -- velocity o f the solidus wave, calculated as

= dAdt, where d is the distance

between tw o thermocouples and A t is the difference in local solidification times. Vs indicates the time available for feeding during the last stages o f solidification.

Temperature Gradient (G, dT/dx) --temperature drop between two adjacent locations w ithin the casting.

The above parameters were observed to have a strong relationship with porosity formation in various castings. Therefore, thermal analysis parameter based criterion functions were experim entally developed in an attempt to correlate the thermal analysis results to the casting porosity.'^ The m ost popular are:

Thermal Parameter Index, TPI: TPI = GVs Freezing Index, FI: FI = G/tf Gradient Acceleration Parameter, GAP: G A P-G V s/tf (7) (6) (5)

Niyama function: N iyam a = G /( C R ) ° ' (8)

LCC function: LCC = Gtf/Vs (9)

31

The significance o f these parameters on the actual physical phenomena was studied extensively the following conclusions were asserted:

and

1. 2.

A large temperature gradient corresponds to an effective interdendritic feeding. LST increases as casting section thickness increases. A steep LST profile indicates that directional solidification was established in the casting during solidification.

3.

For long castings, the lowest point o f the temperature gradient profile is usually in the middle o f the casting. This indicates a hot spot that served as a feeder to the adjacent locations o f the casting.

4.

A logarithmic relationship was found between casting density and the temperature gradient. Steep temperature gradients narrow the mushy zone, thus increasing the probability o f directional solidification.

5.

An increase in the casting density was associated w ith a decrease in solidus velocity.

2.7.1

Computer-Aided Cooling Curve Analysis (CA-CCA) o f alloys is used extensively for the evaluation o f processing and material parameters. It is implemented to predict alloy composition, latent heat o f solidification, evolution o f the solid fi'action, the amounts and types o f phases that solidify and even melt flow stoppage point.'''

The shape o f the cooling curve is the result o f the heat lost to the surroundings by the solidifying metal. The various events that can be observed on the cooling curve may be associated w ith the various transformations occurring in the alloy during solidification.

The use o f the cooling curve first derivative plot, which is the cooling rate, further improves the accuracy o f determination o f the characteristic features o f the cooling curve. A zero value on the first derivative curve indicates a minimum or maximum on the cooling curve. Thus, the time-temperature coordinates can be precisely identified.

2,7.2 Data smoothing

Superimposed upon and indistinguishable from the primary output o f any experiment in which quantitative information is extracted, are random errors which, regardless o f their source, are characteristically described as noise/^ It is o f fundamental importance to remove as much noise as possible without degrading the underlying infonnation. Therefore, the methods o f data filtering are important both as an end in themselves and as a prelude to the further treatment o f the experimental data. In this research, data smoothing techniques were used to reduce noise from the tem perature vs. time data collected during casting solidification.

2.7.2.1 The method o f "Least-Souares" W hen experimental data is available in high densities, the least squares fit is often used to rid the experimental data o f noise. The method o f least squares filtering attempts to fit a curve through a set o f data points. For example, a cubic curve y = agx^ + a]X^ + a|X + a^ can be used to fit the experimental values.

The a's are to be selected such that when each abscissa point is substituted into this equation, the square o f the differences between the computed numbers, y, and the observed numbers is a minimum for the total o f the observations used in determining the coefficients. All o f the error is assumed to be in the ordinate and none in the abscissa.'*^ Other data fitting curves, such as exponentials, may also be used for data smoothing.

This chapter outlines the experimental plan and the related details. Pattern assembly, m old assembly, casting procedures, data acquisition for thermal analysis and metallographic procedures are described.

3.1 Project structure

This project required co-operation between Ryerson U niversity's Centre for Near-Net-Shape Casting Facility and CANM ET's M aterial Testing Laboratory, in Ottawa. CANM ET-M TL facilities were used for m elting and casting the AZ91E alloy in a controlled environment, which included degassing and melting o f the

The experiments were designed with a view to investigating the effect o f the following LFC process parameters on the casting quality and mold filling characteristics:

Vacuum level Pouring temperature Foam density and bead fusion Casting section thickness

Figure 27 shows a flow chart o f the experiments carried out. Each branch o f the flow chmt represents one casting trial. In order to verify data repeatability, all casting experiments w ere repeated at least once. Thus, a total o f 20 castings were produced, including several trial-and-error castings to optimize the LFC process.

The experimental alloy (AZ91E) was poured under vacuum and no-vacuum (gravity) conditions at two temperatures o f 660 °C and 700 °C. Two densities o f foam (0.0208 g/cm^ and 0.0256 g/cm^) and four different section thicknesses (1.0 cm, 1.5 cm, 2.0 cm and 2.5 cm) were used to study the solidification process.

Patterns w ere constructed by cutting polystyrene foam slabs o f two known densities: 0.0208 g/em^ (1.3 pcf) and 0.0256 g/cm^ (1.6 pcf). As they were obtained from tw o independent suppliers, these foam slabs also had different levels o f bead fusion. The low-densitj' foam slab had poorly fused beads, w hile the high-density foam slab had properly fused beads. The degree o f bead fusion was qiualitatively assessed by visual inspection according to the industry standards.

The following SEM images, Figure 30 and Figure 31, illustrate the distinction between the two different levels o f bead fusion for the A RCO T21 foam.

3.3 Ceramic coating slurry

The ceramic coating slurry used in this research was the low-refractory StyroShield 6450, obtained from HA International, Inc. Prior to use, the coating slurry was mixed for 20 minutes to ensure a homogeneous distribution o f the refractory particulates. Also, the specific gravity o f the coating slurry w as adjusted to a 40 Baume level. The coating slurry viscosity was measured w ith the Brookfield RVDV+ProII viscometer. The measured viscosity was 357 cp at 20 °C.

The foam pattern was dipped into the pail with the slurry and then placed into a rotating machine. This machine continuously rotated the foam pattern to ensure uniform coating thickness. A fter 5 minutes o f rotating, the coating w as dry to the touch and the pattern was placed into a circulating hot-air oven. The free-stream temperature in the oven was set to 54 °C (130 °F) and the pattern w as allowed to dry for a minimum o f 12 hours.

3.4 Installation of thermocouples

In order to collect real-time temperature data o f the solidifying casting, 16 K-Type thermocouples were installed in the foam pattern, 4 per horizontal bar.

The thermocouples w ere connected to a Daytronic System 10 DataPac data acquisition unit. The data acquisition system w as calibrated (Fluke 714 temperature calibrator) prior to use. Also, every

thermocouple was tested for functionality prior to being installed into the foam pattern. For each experiment, temperature data was collected for a total o f 360 seconds at a rate o f 7 readings / second.

3.5 Casting box

A new casting box was designed to enable easy installation o f the thermocouple probes into the foam pattern (Figure 32). The foam pattern was positioned diagonally in the box. Thermocouple wire conduits were installed in the w alls o f the wooden box to allow accurate placement o f the thermocouples. These conduits were covered w ith plastic sheathing, to prevent vacuum leak during experiments. Also, entrances 38

o f the conduits into the wooden box were sealed with plum ber's putty to prevent vacuum leaks. All internal edges o f the box were sealed w ith a commercial grade silicone to prevent vacuum leaks through the sides o f the mol d box.

A 19 mm hole was drilled in the bottom o f the casting box to facilitate connection o f a vacuum exhaust fitting. This hole was covered with a steel mesh (WS Tyler M l 00) from the inside o f the box. The purpose o f the mesh was to prevent contamination o f the vacuum system with fine dust and molding sand particles.

In order to prevent dangerous reactions between the liquid magnesium and the surrounding mold medium, sodium-silico-fluoride (Na-SiF) inhibitor was used in conjunction w ith the synthetic mullite sand (AFS35 GFN). The inhibitor was mixed into the sand in the ratio o f 1.16 kg o f Na-SiF inhibitor for every 100 kg o f sand.

Melting and casting o f the magnesium alloy AZ91E was carried out by the technical staff at CANMETMTL facility. The AZ91E alloy was melted in an electric resistance furnace under 0.5% SFg + CO 2 protective atmosphere. The melt was prepared from a virgin ingot supplied by the Near-Net-Shape Research Group.

3.7 T reatm ent o f experim ental data

The data acquisition system was activated and thermocouple data collection began a few seconds before the molten metal was poured into the mold. A minimum o f 2520 data points along the cooling curve were collected for every experiment. In order to accurately carry out the first derivative analysis, it was necessary to remove the initial data points from the collected temperature data set. These data points corresponded to the room temperature readings o f the mold. D ue to the initial low-tem perature data, seen in Figure 34, it was difficult to accurately fit a cubic spline into the tem perature profile. Therefore, a modified data set, shown in Figure 35, was used for thermal analysis.

The modified temperature data was imported to Matlab 6.0 software. In this program, a data fitting tool called "Spline Tool" was used to accurately determine the derivative curve o f the cooling curve. The

error associated with data fitting was monitored for every experiment and was maintained between 7 -- 10%. The resulting spline curve was filtered in the " Spline Tool" package to eliminate temperature oscillations and determine the temperature / time features o f the original cooling curve.

3.8 Casting sectioning

Castings were sectioned on a vertical band saw with a course steel blade. Extreme care was taken to prevent overheating and ignition o f the magnesium dust during machining operations. The following procedure o f selecting metallographic samples was used: 1. 2. Samples from the first set o f casting trials (not repeats) were selected. Samples at a distance o f 5 cm from the sprue were prepared for all section thicknesses.

3. For all 1.5 cm thick horizontal bars, metallographic samples (corresponding to the thermocouple locations) were prepared from the entire length o f the bar; i.e., at 2.5 cm, 5.0 cm, 7.6 cm and 10.2 cm distance from the sprue.

A schematic diagram shown in Figure 36 illustrates the above procedure. Dots indicate the locations o f the metallographic samples.

3.9 Casting density m easurements

In order to determine the overall average density o f each casting sample, A rchim ede's principle was utilized. Sample specific gravity was calculated using Equation 10;

W . Specific gravity = -------- -------Where: Wair = W eight o f sample in air Ws/w = W eight o f samp le (suspended on a thread in a cup o f water), cup and water Wc/w = W eight o f cup and water

(10)

The sample density was obtained by multiplying the calculated sample specific gravity by the density o f water.

A Scientech SP350 balance was used to measure the weight o f the casting samples to an accuracy o f 0.001 grams. This balance was calibrated prior to use with calibration weights o f 200g, lOOg, 50g, lOg, 5g, 2gand Ig.

A 0.139 mm thick thread was used to suspend specimens in a cup filled w ith water. Care was taken to prevent the specimens fi-om touching the walls o f the cup. Uncertainty analysis o f the measured values was determined according to standard techniques. 50

3.10 Casting microstructure analysis

Selected casting specimens w ere ground on a belt grinder to remove any sharp edges and to obtain a plane surface. Then, samples were mounted in transoptic Lucite powder. Buehler SimpliM et 2000 automatic mounting press was used to m ount the specimens. Heating time o f 20 minutes followed by a cooling time o f 7 minutes was adopted for all samples, as it provided the best curing conditions for the Lucite resin. The details o f the metallographic polishing procedure are in Table 4:

In order to reveal the grain boundaries and the eutectic M gi 7 A li 2 phase, the m etallographic specimens Were etched by a glycol solution.

Chapter 4 --Results and Discussion
Analysis o f casting soundness based on the casting surface finish and density m easurem ents is described. The metal flow behavior is evaluated using the visual inspection o f the frozen metal front as well as the Velocity o f the liquid metal front. The results o f thermal analysis follow, with a focus on the cooling rate and the local solidification time. The results o f optical microscopy, in particular, the distribution o f the casting porosity and the morphology o f the M g ^ A ln phase, are discussed.

4.1 Adam 's Riser Equation
A dam 's R iser Equation (A.R.E.) was used to identify casting bars with high predisposition for shrinkage porosity. U sing Equation 3, a theoretical line separating the sound and un-sound (shrinkage-prone) regions w as plotted. Data for the A.R.E. are presented in Table 5 and Table 6 below.

A s can be seen in Figure 39, the calculated data points for the 2.0 cm and 2.5 cm thick bars were relatively close to the A.R.E. prediction line. Hence, these bars had a higher tendency to form shrinkage porosity than the 1.0 cm and 1.5 cm thick bars, which were further away from the sound / un-sound boundary line.

A detailed analysis o f the optical porosity measurements is presented later in Section 4.9. However, conclusions pertinent to the A.R.E. theory are the following:

1.

For gravity castings, i.e., castings produced w ithout vacuum, the casting porosity increased with increasing section thickness. This trend was in agreement with: (a) A dam 's riser theory; and (b) the fact that w ith increasing section thickness, the potential for entrapment o f the EPS pyrolysis products in the casting cavity increased.

2.

For castings produced under vacuum, the casting porosity was seen to decrease with increasing section thickness. Therefore, A dam 's riser theory was not valid for these casting conditions. This trend in porosity w as attributed to the effective removal o f the liquid-EPS residue from the casting cavity as a result o f the applied vacuum. Although thicker casting sections possibly generated more pyrolysis products, the thicker bars also had a greater surface area through which the liquid-EPS and gaseous-EPS pyrolysis products could escape into the surrounding sand. Thus, the thicker horizontal bars enabled higher liquid-EPS residue extraction rates, effectively decreasing the probability o f liquid-EPS entrapment. As a result, the porosity did not increase w ith increasing section thickness.

Therefore, it was observed that A.R.E. was applicable to the AZ91E magnesium alloy cast by the LFC process under gravity conditions; however, it was not valid for the vacuum assisted castings. 48

4.2 O verall casting quality
Casting surfaces were qualitatively inspected for defects. Assessment o f the casting surface often provided indications o f the mold filling behavior and the casting soundness. Casting defects such as misruns, folds and river-like impressions in the casting surfaces were often observed.

Vacuum-related casting defects w ere identified. For instance, the application o f vacuum during mold filling caused the molten metal to penetrate the inter particle cavities o f the surrounding sand mold. As a result, the casting surface was rough and covered with grains o f sand.

Defects associated w ith a relatively low pouring temperature and inadequate removal o f the liquid-EPS pyrolysis products were observed. In casting trials w ith the 660 °C pouring tem perature, the primary degradation products were liquid-EPS. During the mold filling process the m ajority o f these products were pushed to the metal-mold interface where they encountered relatively cold sand. Consequently, the hquid-EPS products began to coalesce and harden. As a result, lumps o f sand contam inated with solidified liquid-EPS were seen to adhere to the casting surfaces. These sand lumps w ere easily removed w ith a wire brush.

The quantitative results o f the casting density analysis and casting mold filling (Sections 4.3 and 4.4) complement the qualitative casting analysis o f this section.

It will be apparent from the following discussion that optimal casting conditions w ere not attained for different combinations o f LFC casting parameters. This resu lted in castings w ith significant defects. S ince these casting defects were unique to individual casting conditions, each combination o f LFC casting parameters is discussed separately.

4.2.1 Casting Condition: 660 "C, 1.3 p cf foam, with vacuum
The castings produced at the 660 °C pouring temperature, with 1.3 p c f foam and applied vacuum were not sound. The horizontal bars did not fill completely, thus producing severe misruns, as seen in Figure 40. -^Iso, sharp edges o f the horizontal bars were not retained along their length. These observations suggest, that the molten metal did not possess sufficient thermal energy to completely decompose and remove the foam pyrolysis products from the casting cavity. 49

A s with other castings produced under vacuum , sand m o!d penetration by the hquid m etal during mold filling occurred on the bottom face o f the easting t w h ich w as adjacent to the vacuum exhaust). H ow ever, the degree o f the m old penetration in this trial w as not as severe as in the other vacuum casting trials.

At the coherency point, chunks o f solid metal begin to form and im pede further metal flow. On a m icroscop ic level, this event c o n esp o n d s to the interlocking o f dendrite arms.

In this casting trial, rough and irregular profiles o f the frozen m etal fronts w ere observed.

It can be shown (.Appendix A), that the (.'nergy required to decom pose I cm ' o! the solid-E PS tbam is ttpproximately 43 .1. In the ca se o f ()je A 79II: alloy, a I cm" o f a 4() "C superheated liquid metal (hbO X' pouring temperature) contains 82K J o f energy. Similarly , a I cm ' o f a 100 "C superheated metal (700 pouring temperature) contains 930 J o f energy. The energy difference betw een the tw o pouring tompcrature.s is approximately 100 J. A s a result, based solely on the energy calcula.iom the 40 'T superheat increase may have potentially doubled the flow length. H ow ever, .such an increase wa.s not ohscr\'cd due to thcnno-physical change,s in the EPS pyroly sis process associated with the high pouring temperatures.

4.3 C asting fill and flow length
The percent easting fill was calculated by dividing the actual (measured) m etal flow length in a horizontal bar by the total length o f the bar. The uncertainty in percent fill measurement was 0.7%. The casting fillability and the metal flow length were observed to mainly depend on the alloy pouring temperature.

4.3.1 Pouring temperature: 660 °C
The percent fill results are presented in Figure 77. It was observed that the casting section thickness affected the casting percent fill. All casting trials showed an increase in the alloy flow length with an increase in the casting section thickness. However, the increase in the casting fill was not proportional to the increase in the casting section thickness. For vacuum castings produced from the 1.3 p c f foam, the percent fill increased at a rate o f 22% / cm increase in section thickness. In gravity castings produced with the 1.3 p c f foam, the percent fill increased at a rate o f 12% / cm increase in section thickness.

In the case o f gravity castings produced w ith the 1.6 p c f foam, the percent fill increased at a rate o f ~ 21% ! cm increase in section thickness. For the ease o f 1.6 p c f castings produced under vacuum, exact numerical results w ere not available due to incom plete filling o f the horizontal bars.

These trends can be possibly explained by noting that that the surface area o f the 2.5 cm thick horizontal bar was 40% larger than that o f the 1.0 cm thick horizontal bar. Therefore, the volum e o f liquid-EPS products passing through a unit area o f the coating was potentially reduced with a thicker section. As a result, clogging o f the coating pores by the liquid-EPS residue was avoided in the thicker bars and the liquid-EPS transport through the ceramic coating was relatively easy, thus allowing increased casting percent fill. The m ost significant factor, however, believed to affect the percent casting fill w as the degree o f the bead fusion o f the expanded polysterene foam. Foam density and bead fusion were seen to have a significant effect on the casting fill. As Figure 77 (a) (b) and (c) vs. (d) illustrate, the substitution o f the well fused high density foam (1.6 pcf) instead o f fhe poorly fused low density foam (1.3 pcf) considerably improved the casting fill. A s discussed in earlier Sections, such a trend contradicts typical LFC observations, where higher density foam s w ere seen to pose greater resistance to the advancing metal front. Further, high density foams were seen to extract more thermal energy fi-om the m olten metal during depolymerization, thus prom oting rapid alloy solidification. Based on these arguments, the percent fill in the high density foam castings was expected to be reduced.

Fiiemann

investigated the effect o f foam density on the m echanical properties o f the EPS foam patterns.

His w ork suggests, that with increased density, the tensile, flexural and compressive strength o f the EPS foam increases. For example, in the case o f the tensile strength, the 0.026 g/cm^ (1.6 pcf) foam was ~ 30% stronger than the 0.0208 g/cm^ (1.3 p c f ) foam. N iem ann also concluded that the flexural and tensile strengths were adversely affected by poor bead fusion. Rossacci investigated the influence o f bead fusion on the foam pattern degradation and casting

formation in the LFC process. His research involved foams o f the same density w ith varying levels o f bead fusion. Rossacci hypothesized, that low EPS bead fusion may enable penetration o f hot m old gases 6eep into the non-degraded EPS pattern, as shown in Figure 78. Tlie transport o f the hot m old gases into the solid-EPS pattern may initiate preheating, collapse and viscous residue formation in the pattern well ahead o f the metal front. In the patterns with high degree o f bead fusion; however, the.hot mold gases

cannot penetrate through the bead structure easily and are eliminated through the coating. This
oiechanism is schematically illustrated in Figure 78.

Figure 79 and Figure 80 are stereo micrographs o f the poorly fused 1.3 p c f foam and the well fused 1.6 p c f foam used in this research. The arrows in Figure 79 indicate random voids observed between respective EPS beads o f the 1.3 p c f foam. The presence o f these voids may have potentially enabled transfer o f hot mold gases from the metal well into the foam pattern.

Figure 79: Poorlyfused 1.3 pcffoam.

Figure 80: Wellfused 1.6 p c f foam.

D ue to the reduced cell strength o f the poorly fused low density foam pattern (1.3 pcf) used in this research, it is possible that the foam collapse and depolymerization process began well ahead o f the m olten metal front. During depolymerization o f the EPS pattern, C-C bonds may have been broken by random scission and, as a result, dimer, trim er and tetram er molecules formed a thick viscous residue (liquid-EPS) well ahead o f the advancing metal front. The presence o f these liquid-EPS degradation products may have increased the frictional forces on the molten metal flow. Consequently, the metal flow length decreased w hen the poorly fused 1.3 p c f foam was used, in com parison to the 1.6 p c f foam casting trials. 68

Therefore, it is possible, that it was not only the foam density which affected the m olten metal flow length, but also the volume fraction o f the liquid-EPS residue generated during the casting process. The results indicate, that the effect o f bead fusion superseded the effect o f the foam density in affecting the metal flow.

4.3,2 Pouring temperature: 700 " C
Increasing the pouring temperature from 660 °C to 700 °C notably increased the casting percent fill, as observed in Figure 81. W ith additional m elt superheat, the percent fill possibly increased due to: a) increased enthalpy o f the metal which resulted in easier EPS degradation (viz., Section 4.2.5); and b) decreased metal viscosity prom oting easier m olten metal flow during the mold filling process.

Virtually all o f the 1.5 cm, 2.0 cm and 2.5 cm thick bars filled completely. It was not possible to comment on any developing trends in the bars since the true metal flow lengths were unknown. However, the effect o f the EPS foam density on the percent fill was readily observed in the 1.0 cm thick horizontal bars. 69

sim ilarly, as in the case o f the 660 °C pouring temperature casting trials, the alloy flow length increased w ith the use o f the high density foam, which was again attributed to the relative amounts o f the liquidEPS products generated during depolymerization o f the foam patterns.

It was o f interest to compare the effect o f pouring temperature and the foam density on the percent fill o f the vacuum cast 1.0 cm thick bars. In the case o f the 1.6 p c f foam castings, the percent fill o f the 1.0 cm thick bar improved from 92 to 94% with an increase in the pouring temperature. However, in the case o f the 1.3 p cf foam castings, the percent fill improved considerably from 39 to 65% w ith an increase in the pouring temperature. It was suggested earlier that an increase in metal superheat reduces the viscosity

o f the liquid-EPS residue, thus enabling easier liquid-EPS products removal from the casting cavity. Therefore, following the argument o f Rossacci, i f the volume fraction o f the liquid-EPS products in the 1.6 p c f castings was indeed less than that in the case o f the 1.3 p c f foam castings, the effect o f the pouring temperature in the 1.6 p c f foam castings would be minimal, since only small volum e fraction o f the liquid-EPS residue in the casting cavity w as affected. On the contraiy, for the 1.3 p c f foam castings, large volume fractions j f the iiquid-EPS residue w ere generated due to the foam 's poor bead fusion. Consequently, greater volume fractions o f the liquid-EPS products were affected, thus resulting in a more appreciable metal flow length increase. Therefore, these experimental observations further validate the applicability o f Rossacci's hypothesis for the current work.

The maximum casting fill was achieved in vacuum castings poured at 700 °C pouring temperature with the 1.6 pcf foam patterns. The minimum casting fill was produced in gravity castings poured at 660 °C pouring temperature with the 1.3 p c f foam patterns.

4.3.3 Section summary
Increasing the pouring temperature possibly increased the casting fillability due to the decreased AZ91E alloy viscosity. Moreover, increasing the pouring temperature made the foam depolym erization process relatively easier, thus increasing the metal flow lengths.

Poor bead fusion o f the 1.3 p c f foam patterns appeared to adversely affect the casting fillabilily, possibly due to the premature collapse o f the solid-EPS foam ahead o f the m olten metal front. As a result, higher volume fractions o f the liquid-EPS residue were likely generated in the 1.3 p c f foam castings than in the 1.6 p c f foam castings, which resulted in a shorter metal flow lengths. 70

4.4 C asting density and soundness
A sound casting is free o f external defects, such as misruns, as well as internal defects, such as internal cavities. The form er class o f defects was discussed in Section 4.2 earlier, while the latter is the topic o f this section.

Liquid-EPS products were observed to influence the formation o f macroporosity and internal cavities in the horizontal bars. These pyrolysis products were seen to remain entrapped in the interior o f the horizontal bars, w ith consequent formation o f cavities ranging in width from 0.5 mm to 5 mm.

The measured densities o f several casting sections exceeded the theoretical alloy density. Inclusions originating mainly from entrapped sand were identified as possible causes o f these anomalies.

The dense segments o f the castings were associated with small temperature gradients and low solidus velocities during solidification. Thus, it appears that the localized solidification conditions affected the volume fraction o f shrinkage porosity, which in turn affected the casting density.

The uncertainty associated with the specimen density measurements did not exceed 1% and the Uncertainty associated with the solidus velocity calculation did not exceed 7%.

The data points presented in the plots o f this section correspond to the average density values for the initial and the repeat casting trials. In these graphs, error bars were intentionally omitted for clarity. The density values typically varied from the presented average value by a maximum o f 0.01 g/cm^.

Further, since each average data point is based only on two measurements (initial trial and a repeat trial), the error bar maximum and minimum values would correspond to the two measured data points.

Also, the lines connecting the data points in the figures were inserted for ease o f following the developing trends in the respective horizontal bars.

Each combination o f the LFC casting param eters affected the casting density distribution to a different degree. As a result, individual casting conditions are discussed separately.

71

4.4.1 Casting Condition: 660 °C, 1.3p c f foam, with vacuum
The combination o f the 660 °C pouring temperature, 1.3 p c f foam and application o f vacuum resulted in the average casting density o f 1.79 g/cm^ w ith a standard deviation o f 2.68 x 10'^ g/em^. U sing Equation 4, the theoretical average casting porosity level was calculated to be 0.66%. Figure 82 shows the variation in the casting density along the horizontal bar for different section thicknesses. It was not possible to obtain sufficient data to generate the "solidus velocity vs. distance from sprue" plot for this condition due to experimental difficulties.

Figure 82: Average density distribution fo r trial: 660 ° C /1.3 p c f /w ith vacuum. The casting density o f the 2.0 cm thick bar reached a m inim um o f 1.73 g/cm^ near the sprue. This decrease in the casting density was attributed to a high fraction o f sub-surface shrinkage porosity, as observed in Figure 83. The 1.0 cm, 1.5 cm and 2.5 cm thick horizontal bars contained shrinkage porosity as well. However, as Figure 84 illustrates, instead o f m assive sub-surface shrinkage pores, inter-dendritic shrinkage cavities formed throughout the casting.

The decrease in the density o f the 2.5 cm thick bar at the 5 cm distance from the sprue suggests the presence o f cavities in the casting bar. Two factors may have contributed to this casting defect. First, this location possibly served as a feeder o f liquid metal to the surrounding casting locations during the final stages o f solidification.

Secondly, as Figure 85 suggests, the decrease in the casting density at a distance o f 5 cm from the sprue Was the result o f m acroscopic cavities. These cavities possibly form ed due to tw o factors. First, the metal flow in the vacuum castings consisted o f liquid metal and partially solidified chunks, as seen in Figure 85 in the region o f the cavity. Secondly, since the internal cavity was located mainly in the center-region o f the horizontal bar, it is possible that the agglomerated liquid-EPS products were entrapped in the casting channel during m old filling and also contributed to the formation o f the cavity.

Figure 85: Sectioned 2.5 cm thick horizontal bar. : Direction o f flow

As Figure 40 illustrates, the current combination o f LFC param eters produced misruns in the horizontal bars. It w as indeed difficult to obtain a complete casting. The solidus velocity at the entrance o f the itorizontal bar ranged between 4 -- 12 cm/s for the 1.5 cm, 2.0 cm and 2.5 cm thick bars, with different temperature gradients present in the respective horizontal bars (Section 4.8). Therefore, simultaneous feeding o f thin and thick sections from a single sprue was not successful in this casting trial. To improve the casting fill, risers and feeders should have been used to provide additional liquid metal to the horizontal bars and possibly manipulate the temperature distribution w ithin the casting.

4.4.2 Casting Condition: 660 " C, 1.6p c f foam, with vacuum
For castings produced w ith the 660 °C pouring temperature, 1.6 p c f foam and cast under vacuum, the average casting density was 1.78 g/cm^ with a standard deviation o f 7.48 x 10'^ g/cm^. Also, the theoretical average casting porosity was 1.93%. The density and solidus velocity profiles for individual horizontal bars are presented in Figure 86 and Figure 87.

Figure 87: Solidus velocity fo r trial: 660 °C/1 .6 p c f / with vacuum.

The density values in the 2.5 cm thick bar approached the theoretical density o f the AZ91E alloy. For the 2.5 cm thick bar, the mean density was 1.81 g/cm^ with a standard deviation o f 4.12 x 10'^ g/cm^. The measured optical porosity in the 2.5 cm thick bar was 0.73% (viz.. Section 4.9), the lowest for all horizontal bars in this trial.

Further, the solidus velocity in the 2.5 cm thick bar was the slowest o f all horizontal bars. This suggests that the solidification firont traveled slowly along the horizontal bar, thus possibly allowing the liquid metal to feed the interdendritic regions and prevent formation o f shrinkage cavities. As a result, relatively dense horizontal bar w as produced.

The 1.0 cm thick horizontal bar also showed a relatively uniform density distribution along the length o f the bar. Tiie density ranged betw een 1.77 - 1.80 g/cm^ with an average and a standard deviation o f 1.78 g/cm^ and 1.22 x 10"^ g/cm^, respectively. In this ease, the possibility o f establishing directional solidification was rejected since the solidus plot (Figure 87) decreased near the flow tip. Such trend indicates the presence o f heat waves passing through the horizontal bar.

The density values o f the individual casting sections occasionally exceeded the theoretical AZ91E alloy density.

Comparing the current no-vacuum trial to that o f the castings produced under vacuum (Section 4.4.2), it was observed that vacuum increased the casting density variation. For the vacuum trials w ith the 1.6 p c f foam, the casting density ranged between 1.75 - 1.81 g/cm^ with a standard deviation o f 7.48 x 10'^ g/cm^, whereas for the castings produced under gravity conditions in the current trial, the casting density ranged between 1.81 - 1.82 g/cm^, w ith a standard deviation o f 3.19 x 10'^ g/cm^. This supports earlier suggestion that the metal flow in vacuum castings possibly consisted o f a liquid metal carrying partially solidified chunks, which cooled separately from the bulk liquid metal. As a result, vacuum castings had an inhomogeneous internal structure which caused a higher casting density variance. Clearly, the casting soundness was compromised by the vacuum.

In castings produced w ithout vacuum, directional solidification was established. As observed in Figure 97, the solidus velocity profiles generally increased with increasing distance fi-om the sprue. This suggests, that casting locations near the flow tip solidified faster than locations near the sprue, which is a requirement for the establishment o f directional solidification.

79

As a result o f directional solidification, there seems to be a general trend o f an increasing casting density w ith increasing distance from the sprue. Such a trend was confirmed by the analysis o f the cooling rates in the respective horizontal bars. As shown in Figure 98, the cooling rates increased with the distance from the sprue.

The high density in the casting bars was attributed to the presence o f inclusions. Figure 62 clearly illustrated that the application o f vacuum caused liquid metal to penetrate the sand mold. During such a process, the m olten alloy possibly caused u localized erosion o f the sand, resulting in a carryover o f the eroded sand into the casting cavity. As Figure 101 and Figure 102 show, sand fragments w ere present in the casting interior near the casting surface.

In addition to the high casting density values, density fluctuations along the length o f the casting b ar were observed. As Figure 99 shows, all horizontal bars exhibited this behavior. The fluctuations in the casting density were attributed to the following factors. First, the presence o f partially solidified chunks resulted in non-homogeneous casting density, as already discussed in Section 4.2.6. Secondly, the presence o f the solid chunks possibly obstructed the incoming liquid metal feed during the last stages o f solidification. As a result, regions with inadequate liquid metal feed contained shrinkage pores, thus decreasing the casting density.

4.4.6 Casting Condition: 700 "C, 1.3 pcf foam, with vacuum
The average density for the castings produced at the 700 °C pouring temperature, with 1.3 p c f foam pattern cast under vacuum was 1.81 g/cm^ with a standard deviation o f 3.78 x lO'^g/cm^. The theoretical average casting porosity was less than 0.05%. W ith the exception o f the 1.0 cm bar, the density values in the 1.5 cm, 2.0 cm and 2.5 cm thick bars ranged betw een 1.76 - 1.83 g/cm^ w ith an average o f 1.82 g/em^ and a standard deviation o f 1.52 x 10'^ g/cm^.

As Figure 103 shows, the 1.0 cm thick bar exhibits a sharp decrease in the casting density w ith increasing distance from the sprue. Figure 105 and Figure 106 show the 1.0 cm thick bar from the two (initial and repeat) casting trials. It appears that the decrease in the casting density near the firozen metal front w as to an extent caused by the metal chunks restricting the liquid metal feed.

The objective o f the statistical analysis was to verify, w hether or not selected LFC process parameters affected the casting density.

The null hypothesis was established w ith the view to determining w hether or not a given LFC parameter affected the casting density (based on the density variances associated w ith the parameter). It was not the objective o f the statistical analysis to hypothesize the population (alloy) density.

The acceptance or rejection o f the null hypothesis was based on calculating the Pa-max value from the experimental test statistic. The following decision criteria were selected:

I f Pa-max < 80%, the null hypothesis was accepted (i.e., the LFC param eters did not affect the average casting density). I f Pa-max > 90%, the null hypothesis was rejected (i.e., the LFC param eters did affect the average casting density). I f 80% < Pa-max < 90%, uo decision was rendered. In such cases, more experimental data w ould be required to m ake an accurate decision.

Therefore, based on the results o f the above statistical analysis, it is evident, that with the exception o f the 700 "C / 1.3 p c f / w ith vacuum casting trial, the respective casting parameters (i.e., pouring temperature, foam density and applied vacuum ) indeed affected the average casting density. In the case o f the 660 °C / 1.3 p c f / with vacuum casting trial, the Pa^nax value corresponds to the "no-decision" region o f the hypothesis testing technique. As a result, more experimental data would be required to make a definite conclusion.

The results o f Section 4.4 w ere also analyzed using the analysis o f variance (ANOVA) technique. This analysis allowed the determination o f w hether o f not a selected casting param eter influenced the average casting density (based on its impact on the casting density variance). This analysis was carried out in the M s Excel Data Analysis tool. A Fisher F-statistic was calculated and used to obtain the Pa-max value for rejection o f the null hypothesis. The Fisher random variable was defined as:

This test statistic applied to any com bination o f casting parameters involving two statistically independent random variables w ith Vi and V: degrees o f freedom. In m ost cases, V| and Vz were equal to 1.

The ANOVA analysis w as used to determine w hether or not the pouring tem perature and the application o f vacuum affected the average casting density o f the 1.6 p c f foam castings. This analysis was treated as a 2-factor experiment with replication. The results o f the ANOVA analysis as processed by MS Excel are presented in Table 8. Detailed results are presented in Appendix B. 1.

The ANOVA analysis suggests, that there were no interactive effects between the alloy pouring temperature and the applied vacuum. Further, there was no effect o f the pouring temperature on the casting density; as well as, there was no effect o f the vacuum on the casting density.

These statistical results agree w ith conclusions made in earlier sections. Since the 1.6 p c f foam castings contained only relatively small volume fractions o f liquid-EPS products, the effect o f vacuum and pouring temperature was not very noticeable. I f greater volum e fractions o f liquid-EPS products were present, the effect o f the vacuum and the pouring tem perature would be possibly m ore pronoimced. Such behavior was obseiwed qualitatively earlier in the 1.3 p c f foam trials; however, lack o f experimental density data prevented carrying out the ANOVA analysis for these casting trials.

The ANOVA analysis w as also used to verify w hether the foam density and the application o f vacuum influenced the average casting density in the 660 °C and 700 °C pouring tem perature casting trials.

The AiNOVA analysis for the 660 °C pouring temperature trials produced the following results (Table 9):

4.4.10 Section summary
The application o f vacuum during mold filling resulted in the molten metal flow past the dendrite coherency point. As a result, flow o f partially solidified metal occurred. Consequently, m acroscopic voids formed in the interior o f several casting bars. These voids were prom inent especially in the 660 °C pouring temperature casting trials, where entrapped liquid-EPS possibly further increased the size o f the cavities.

Statistical analysis revealed that castings produced under vacuum had a greater variance o f the casting density. This is indicative o f a heterogeneous casting structure. Increasing the pouring temperature improved the casting density uniformity, due to a possible reduction o f entrapped liquid-EPS products in the horizontal bars.

Entrapped liquid-EPS products were seen to create voids in the interior o f the horizontal bars. Further, it appears that the molten metal did not possess sufficient energy to pyrolyze the liquid-EPS products, since hardened EPS residue was observed on the cavity walls.

In several instances, the casting density was seen to exceed the theoretical alloy density. In these cases, sand inclusions were identified as a potential source o f the anomaly.

4.5 M etal velocity
The metal front velocity was calculated ifom the dynamic temperature data collected by the data acquisition system during mold filling. For each thermocouple, a maximum tem perature w as recorded. Determining the tim e delay between the tem perature maxima o f adjacent thermocouples enabled the calculation o f the m olten metal velocity. The uncertainty associated with the metal velocity measurements did not exceed 4%.

The data points in the "Average metal velocity" plots correspond to an average metal velocity in two casting trials (initial and repeat). As in Section 4.4, error bars w ere omitted from these plots for clarity.

The metal behavior seemed to be affected by every combination o f the investigated LFC parameters. Therefore, respective casting conditions were exam ined and their effect on the m etal velocity discussed.

4. S. I Casting Condition: 660 "C, 1.3 p cf foam, with vacuum
In the casting trial with the 660 °C pouring temperature, 1.3 p c f foam and applied vacuum, the average metal velocity was 1.6 cm/s w ith a standard deviation o f 0.7 cm/s. A s Figure 113 indicates, the 1.0 cm and 1.5 cm thick bars did not fill sufficiently to allow calculation o f the velocity profiles for these bars. In th e case o f the 2.0 cm and 2.5 cm thick bars, only partial velocity profiles were available (see Section 4.4.1).

The metal velocities near the entrance o f the horizontal channels were sim ilar for all section thicknesses, ranging between 1.4 -- 1.9 cm/s w ith a standard deviation o f 0.3 cm/s. As the m etal front advanced, the metal velocity was observed to decrease w ith increasing flow length. Since the molten metal was solidifying as it progressed though the foam pattern, its viscosity as well as the solid fraction increased, thus slowing down the metal flow.

4.5.2 Casting Condition: 66§ °C, 1.6 pcf foam, with vacuum
The casting condition w ith the 660 °C pouring temperature, 1.6 p c f foam and applied vacuum resulted in an average metal velocity o f 6.4 cm/s w ith a standard deviation o f 2.0 cm/s.

In this casting trial, the metal velocities ranged between 4.0 -- 11.5 cm/s. Comparing these values to those o f castings produced w ith the 1.3 p c f foam (Section 4.5.1), a general increase in metal velocities was observed. As discussed earlier, it is likely that the 1.3 p c f poorly fused foam may have produced larger volume fractions o f the liquid-EPS residue. As a result, the friction in the casting channel increased due to the accumulation and adherence o f the liquid-EPS products to the mold walls. Consequently, the metal velocity was slow er in the 1.3 p c f foam castings than in the case o f the 1.6 p c f foam castings.

M etal velocity oscillations developed in the longitudinal direction o f the flow, as observed in Figure 114. These oscillations were characteristic o f the progressive mold filling during LFC.

As previously discussed ^ the amplitude o f these velocity oscillations decreased w ith increasing distance from the sprue. Further, these oscillations disappear at higher pouring tem peratures, where the foam degradation and rem oval process becomes energetically easier. 92

4.5.3 Casting Condition: 660 "C, 1.6 p c f foam, without vacuum
The combination o f the 660 °C pouring temperature, 1.6 p c f foam and the absence o f vacuum resulted in an average metal velocity o f 2.8 cm/s, w ith a standard deviation o f 1.1 cm/s.

Comparing the current results (Figure 115) w ith those o f Section 4.5.2, it was observed that the average metal velocity decreased from 6.4 cm/s in the vacuum trial to 2.8 cm/s m the current gravity trial. This decrease in metal velocity w as attributed to the slow er extraction rate o f the EPS pyrolysis products from the casting cavity during the gravity filling process. This result supports the conclusions o f Liu et. al. (see Section 2.2.1.2).

Furthermore, comparing the standard deviations o f the similar vacuum trial (2.0 cm /s) to the current casting condition, it appears that the application o f vacuum caused a significant variation in the metal velocity. This observation complements the results o f Section 4.2 and Section 4.4.

The combination o f the 700 °C pouring temperature, 1.6 p c f foam and applied vacuum, resulted in an average metal velocity o f 6.3 cm/s, with a standard deviation o f 1.4 cm/s.

In this casting trial, the m etal velocities ranged between 4.6 --8.3 cm/s. Comparing Figure 114 and Figure 116, it is evident that the increase in pouring temperature generally increased the metal velocities in the horizontal bars. This change was attributed to the greater heat content o f the molten metal (see Appendix A), which caused the EPS degradation process to be relatively easier, w ith attendant increase in the metal flow length and velocity.

This trend was contraiy to, for example, casting trials with the 660 °C pouring temperature, 1.6 p c f foam, cast under gravity conditions. The current velocity trend was attributed to the presence o f the vacuum. Due to the enhanced extraction o f the pyrolysis products from the casting cavity, the metal flow behavior resembled that o f the open-cavity casting processes (such as sand-casting). Therefore, the application o f vacuum again caused an appreciable departure from the typical LFC flow behavior.

4.5.5 Casting Condition: 700 °C, 1.3 p c f foam, with vacuum
The combination o f the 700 °C pouring temperature, 1.3 p c f foam and applied vacuum, produced castings w ith an average metal velocity o f 3.3 cm/s and a standard deviation o f 0.7 cm/s.

The metal velocities in this casting trial ranged between 2.4 --4.8 cm/s, as observed in Figure 117, In comparison with the previous casting condition w here a 1,6 p c f foam w as used, a decrease in metal velocity w as again observed in this 1,3 p c f foam trial.

Figure 117: Average metal velocity fo r trial: 700 ° C /1.3 p c f/w ith vacuum. In this casting trial, the metal velocity generally increased w ith increasing section thickness, which was contrary to the trend observed in the previous casting condition. Since a vacuum was applied in both cases, it was expected that sim ilar trends would develop for the 1.6 p c f and the 1.3 p c f casting trials. However, possibly due to the higher volume fraction o f the liquid-EPS products in the current 1.3 p c f foam castings, the metal velocity was affected by additional factors, such as the potential clogging o f the ceramic coating's pores. Such an event would result in the accumulation o f the liquid-EPS products at the nietal-mold interface. Since a thinner horizontal bar w ould generate less liquid-EPS residue, then higher nieta] velocities w ould be expected relative to the thicker horizontal bar.

4.5.6 Casting Condition: 700 "C, 1.6 p c f foam, without vacuum
In this casting trial, the com bination o f the 700 °C pouring tem perature, 1.6 p c f foam and the absence o f the vacuum yielded an average metal velocity o f 3.3 cm/s w ith a standard deviation o f 0.8 cm/s. In this casting trial, the metal velocity ranged between 2.4 --5.2 cm/s.

The 1.5 cm and 2.5 cm thick bars showed a tendency fo r metal velocity oscillations. Comparing the velocity profiles o f the sim ilar 660 °C casting trial, Figure 115, to the current velocity results. Figure 118, it seems that the amplitude o f metal oscillations decreased with an increase in the pouring temperature. Indeed, the metal velocity standard deviation decreased from 2.1 cm/s to 0.8 cm/s. This supports earlier work,®° where metal oscillations were also seen to relate to the alloy pouring temperature.

Further, at increased pouring temperatures, a potentially higher volum e fraction o f gaseous-EPS products evolved in the casting cavity. These gaseous-EPS products are know n to be easily removed to the surrounding sand. Therefore, possibly as a result o f the lower fraction o f the liquid-EPS residue generated during the mold filling o f the 1.6 p c f castings, higher metal velocities were observed.

4.5. 8 Section summary
The molten metal velocity was seen to oscillate in the longitudinal direction o f the flow. This behavior was attributed to the sequential m old filling mechanism o f the LFC process.

M etal velocity in the 1.6 p c f foam casting trials was seen to be liigher than in the 1.3 p c f foam trials. This behavior was explained by tlie increased volume fraction o f the liquid-EPS products present in the 1.3 p c f foam castings. The liquid-EPS products possibly accumulated at the metal-mold interface causing increased frictional resistance to the metal flow.

Castings produced under vacuum exhibited higher metal velocities than gravity castings. This effect o f the vacuum w as attributed to the effective extraction o f the liquid-EPS products from the casting cavity.

M etal flow in the vacuum castings resem bled that o f open-cavity mold casting processes. For the vacuum casting trials, the metal velocity decreased with increasing distance from the sprue. However, gravity castings exhibited metal velocity oscillations, indicating that the metal flow was governed by the degradation rates o f the solid-EPS foam.

The analysis o f the m etal velocity variances indicates that the application o f vacuum decreased the metal velocity uniformity. This result suggests that the metal flow in the vacuum castings was more random. Also, increasing the pouring tem perature seemed to increase the m etal velocity and the metal velocity uniformity. This effect w as more pronounced in the 1.3 p c f foam castings, w here greater volume fractions o f the liquid-EPS products were present. 98

4.6 L ocal solidification tim e and the cooling rate

Local Solidification Time (LST) was calculated as the tim e required for the casting to cool from the nonequilibrium (experimental) liquidus temperature to the non-equilibrium (experimental) solidus

temperature. The non-equilibrium solidus tem perature was assumed to equal the eutectic reaction temperature. The non-equilibrium tem peratures w ere used for the analysis due to the evident departure from equilibrium solidification conditions.

The Cooling Rate (CR) was determined by calculating the tem perature drop from the non-equilibrium liquidus to the non-equilibrium solidus temperatures and dividing this value by the tim e required for the temperature drop to occur.

The uncertainty associated w ith the LST and CR m easurements did not exceed 1%.

It was found that the local solidification time increased with increasing section thickness. Alternatively, the cooling rate decreased w ith increasing section thickness. This trend was expected, since a thicker section contained greater mass o f the hot alloy, thus rem aining hotter for longer periods o f time.

In the gravity casting trials, the cooling rate seemed to correlate w ith the metal flow length. This trend Was in agreement w ith the conventional casting processes, where an increase o f the cooling rate promotes faster solid fraction development w ith attendant increase in the metal viscosity and a decrease in the alloy flow length. Such a behavior, however, was not observed in vacuum castings. A s an example. Table 13 presents the cooling rates in the 1.0 cm thick bar at a distance o f 2.5 cm from the sprue, for different casting conditions. The cooling rates and corresponding flow lengths indicate, that despite the higher cooling in vacuum trials, the metal flow-lengths exceeded those o f the corresponding gravity castings.

Therefore, these results show a relationship w ith earlier observations (Section 4.2.1) w here the application o f vacuum was seen to cause m olten metal flow beyond the dendrite coherency point. As a result, the concept o f dendrite coherency cannot be adopted for vacuum assisted castings.

The results o f the thermal analy sis are discussed with respect to the tw o pouring temperatures.

4.6.1 Pouring temperature: 660 °C
The LST in the 2.0 cm and 2.5 cm thick bars decreased linearity w ith increasing distance from the sprue, as seen in Figure 120. The values for linear trend lines ranged between 0.996 and 0.999.

Examining the LST curves for the 1.0 cm and 1.5 cm thick bars in Figure 120, it was noted that the LST profiles depart from linearity near the sprue. This departure was possibly the result o f the proxim ity effect o f the sprue. The locations o f the horizontal bars adjacent to the sprue rem ained hotter for longer periods o f tim e due to the relatively high thermal energy content o f the sprue. The proxim ity effect was more pronounced in the thinner casting sections, where a relatively large thermal gradients between the sprue and the casting section w ere established.

Upon extending the 1.0 cm bar and 1.5 cm bar LST profiles to the left, i.e., tow ards the sprue, it seems that the LST trends approach a similar LST value as the 2.0 cm and 2.5 cm thick bars. For the 660 °C pouring temperature trials, this common LST value was between 177 --208 seconds. This suggests, that the L ST o f the sprue was within this range. As a result, the maximum tim e allowed for a complete filling o f the casting was less than 210 seconds.

The results o f this research repeatedly demonstrated that the flow lengths o f the 1.3 p c f castings were less than those o f the 1.6 p c f foam castings. Such results were contrary to num erous experimental observations.^'' Explanation o f this counter-intuitive metal flow behavior was attem pted utilizing the

results o f the thermal analysis. Table 14 shows the average cooling rates for different casting conditions.

This data shows that, in general, the 1.6 p c f foam castings exhibit higher cooling rates than the 1.3 p cf foam castings. Therefore, as expected, the 1.6 p c f foam indeed extracted more heat energy from the molten m etal than the 1.3 p c f foam. This result is fully in agreement w ith the observations o f other researchers, since the depolymerization process o f the 1.6 p c f foam requires m ore energy than the

depolymerizaiton o f the 1.3 p c f foam.

In spite o f the higher cooling rates in the 1.6 p c f castings, however, the metal flow lengths exceeded those o f the 1.3 p c f castings. This suggests, that it was not necessarily the exothermic process o f solid-EPS foam removal that caused the anomalous metal flow behavior (i.e., metal flow length was not governed by the freezing rate o f the alloy). Instead, it was the quantitv and the mechanism o f the liquid-EPS residue removal from the casting cavity, which seemed to play a fundamental role in controlling the mold filling process.

It is evident from Section 4.2, that significant quantities o f entrapped liquid-EPS w ere present in the 1.3 p c f castings (surface and interior). The excessive volume o f the liquid-EPS products in the casting cavity Was likely the result o f the poor bead fusion which caused premature degradation o f the solid-EPS pattern ahead o f the molten m etal front. Consequently, the EPS bead fusion level was identified as a critical foam property that influenced the metal flow length and metal velocity, to a greater extent than the foam

4.6.2 Pouring température: 700 °C
An increase in the pouring temperature from 660 °C to 700 °C resulted in a more pronounced proximity effect o f the sprue on the L ST profiles o f respective horizontal bars. A s observed in Figure 120, the sprue proximity effect in the 660 °C pouring temperature castings was evident as far as 5 cm along the bars. For the castings poured at 700 °C, the sprue proxim ity effect increased as far as 8 cm from the sprue.

Furthermore, it is possible that as a consequence o f greater temperature gradients betw een the sprue and the horizontal bars, directional solidification was established in the 700 °C castings.

As Figure 121 shows, an increase in the pouring tem perature did not appreciably affect the LST profiles in respective horizontal bars.

Therefore, it appears that an increase o f the melt superheat by 40 °C did not have a significant impact on the cooling rate or the local solidification tim e o f the castings. Validity o f this claim w ould suggest, that the enhancement o f the alloy flow lengths as a result o f increased pouring tem perature was not solely caused by the slower alloy solidification. Instead, the added melt superheat affected the EPS degradation process. In particular, it caused a decrease in the viscosity o f the liquid-EPS products, which allowed increased mold filling.

To verify this claim, ANOV A analysis was carried out with the pouring temperature and section thickness as the two factors investigated. The objective was to determine w hether or not the section thickness or the alloy pouring tem perature had an effect on the casting cooling rate. The results o f the analysis are presented in Table 15. The details o f the A N OVA analysis are presented in A ppendix B.4.

Based on the results o f the A N O VA analysis, it can be concluded that the section thickness significantly affected the casting cooling rate, w hile the pouring temperature did not. Therefore, these conclusions indicate that the volume fraction o f the liquid-EPS products in the casting cavity (function o f section thickness) was o f fundamental importance in affecting the alloy cooling rate and the casting mold filling.

As observed in Figure 123, the effect o f vacuum on the cooling rate was noticeable. Casting bars produced under vacuum conditions experienced higher cooling rates. It is o f interest to note, that the shape o f the cooling rate profiles along the bars w ere sim ilar for the vacuum and the gravity casting trials.

As Table 16 shows, the cooling rate decreased with increasing section thickness. It was noted that the effect o f the vacuum on the cooling rate o f individual horizontal bars was not consistent. The vacuum increased the cooling rate in the 1.0 cm thick horizontal bar by 1.08%, whereas in the 2.5 cm bar, the vacuum increased the cooling rate by 27.25% . This was possibly due to the increased surface area o f the thicker casting section.

Chvorinov's rule for different sand mold materials. However, there is no literature available on the applicability o f the Chvorinov's rule to the LFC o f magnesium alloys. Data collected for all casting trials was plotted in Figure 125. This plot suggests that, in general, the value o f Chvorinov's constant for LFC o f magnesium alloys (k) is 324.6 and the value o f the exponent (n) is 1.4.

Previous research ^ on aluminum alloys east by the LFC process suggested an exponent value o f 2.0. This indicates, that magnesium alloys do not respond to the increased local solidification time (for example via increased section thickness) to the same degree as aluminum alloys. To obtain an equivalent LST with a magnesium alloy, a thicker section would be necessary than in the case o f an aluminum alloy casting.

As can be observed from Figure 125, there was a significant scatter in the LST data for individual casting modulus values. This scatter was likely the result o f vaiying pouring temperature, vacuum and different foam types. Chvorinov's plots for individual casting conditions me presented in Figure 126.

4.7 C asting tem p eratu re distribution
The temperature data collected by the data acquisition system w ere used to generate temperature distribution plots for the 1.5 cm thick horizontal bars. The temperature distribution profiles were determined for various times after the beginning o f solidification (i.e., crossing o f the liquidus line).

As Figure 127 shows, castings produced under gravity conditions rem ained at higher tem peratures than vacuum castings, at difîerent stages o f solidification. This observation is in agreement w ith Section 4.6, where higher cooling rates were observed in vacuum castings. Table 17 presents the average temperatures for the 1.5 cm thick horizontal bars for different times after crossing o f the liquidus temperature.

From Table 17 it was determ ined that the average tem perature difference between the vacuum and gravity castings was 16.5 °C for the 1.3 p c f foam trials and 22.9 °C for the 1.6 p c f foam trials.

Inspecting Figure 127, it was further noted that the 40 °C temperature difference in the pouring temperature did not correspond to a 40 °C increase in the casting temperature. In general, the 40 °C increase o f superheat caused a 3 --18 "C increase in the casting temperature.

The temperature profiles in Figure 127 correspond with the profiles o f the local solidification times (Figure 120 and Figure 124), where the proxim ity effect o f the sprue on the individual casting bars was observed. The temperature profiles in Figure 127 near the sprue also departed from the otherwise linear

110

monotonie trend. The increase in the casting temperature near the sprue as a result o f the sprue proximity effect w as typically 5 - 1 0 °C.

Figure 127 also demonstrates that the casting temperatures in the 1.6 p c f foam castings were, in general, lower than in the case o f the 1.3 p c f castings. This observation validates the earlier claim that, during the foam degradation process, the 1.6 p c f foam indeed extracted more therm al energy from the molten metal than the 1.3 p c f foam.

4.8 C asting tem perature gradient
The temperature gradient at the 5 cm distance from the sprue was calculated w hen the temperature at the horizontal bar mid-section reached the non-equilibrium solidus temperature. This allowed the assessment o f the presence o f directional solidification prior to the completion o f casting solidification. A positive temperature gradient suggested that the m etal down the stream (i.e., near the frozen metal front) was at a lower temperature than the metal near the sprue. Similarly, a negative tem perature gradient would indicate a heat-wave passing through the horizontal bar from the sprue towards the metal front, potentially re-melting the casting.

As observed in Figure 128, the temperature gradients decreased w ith increasing section thickness. This suggests that the thicker horizontal bars had a more uniform temperature distribution along the length o f the bar, relative to the thinner casting sections. In addition, this trend corresponded w ith the higher cooling rates observed in the thinner casting sections. Thus, the temperature gradient calculations support Adam's Riser Equation predictions.

There seems to be a general trend o f sm aller temperature gradients in the vacuum trials, as compared to the gravity casting trials. This suggests the possibility that during the vacuum m old filling process, the molten metal was quickly drawn into the horizontal bar by the vacuum. As a result, the temperature gradients along the horizontal bars decreased and the casting solidified w ith a more uniform temperature distribution.

The temperature gradients established in the 1.0 cm thick sections were nearly double those in the 2.5 cm thick sections. In general, it appears that there was a monotonie trend o f decreasing temperature gradient with increasing section thickness. However, some casting trails exhibited fluctuations in the gradient profile for different section thicknesses.

Further, as observed in Figure 128, it seems that an increase in pouring tem perature did not appreciably affect the temperature gradients in the individual horizontal bars. This claim was verified w ith the ANOVA analysis carried out for the pouring tem perature and the section thickness as the two factors studied. The results o f the A N O V A analysis are presented in Table 18. Detailed results o f the A N OVA analysis are presented in A ppendix B.5.

Therefore, the ANOVA results suggest that the pouring temperature did not affect the thermal gradients established in the different casting bars. The casting section thickness indeed affected the thermal gradients in the horizontal bars. These conclusions correlate well with the negligible effect o f the melt superheat on the LST and CR values, as discussed in preceding sections.

The temperature gradients seemed to affect the degree o f thermal undercooling present in the castings. As Figure 129 illustrates, the thermal undercooling changed along the distance o f the 1.5 cm thick horizontal bar. Locations near the sprue (2.5 cm) did no t experience any undercooling, w hile locations n ear the frozen metal front (10 cm) show undercooling near the non-equilibrium eutectic tem perature o f 425 °C. These trends would in turn affect the formation o f dendrites and consequent solute segregation in along the length o f the bar (see Section 4.10). 114

Since the size o f the solute-rich region ahead o f the solid-liquid interface is affected by the thermal gradient, then the prim ary and secondary dendrite arm growth would be likely affected by the thermal gradient as well. Consequently, the as-cast m icrostructure o f the horizontal bars w as affected by the temperature gradients. This phenom enon is discussed later in Section 4.10.

4.9 C asting porosity and the criterion functions

M icroscopic analysis o f the m etallographic specimens revealed only rare formation o f gas porosity. Therefore, it is likely that due to the effective use o f the CO 2 + SFg protective atmosphere, Hydrogen and other gases w ere not absorbed by the m olten metal. As a result, the majority o f the observed casting porosity was the result o f solidification shrinkage and entrapment o f the EPS pyrolysis products.

Formation o f solidification shrinkage occurred preferentially in the inter-dendritic regions o f the microstructure. These regions w ere prone to form shrinkage cavities possibly due to the inadequate feeding o f liquid metal during the last stages o f solidification (as a result o f dendrite arm interlocking).

Solidification shrinkage pores often spanned several dendrites, thus forming interdendritic networks. In particular, regions near the mold walls contained extensive networks originating in the casting interior and extending to the casting surface. Due to the increased nucléation rate o f the prim ary M g dendrites in these locations, the possibility o f dendrite arm interlocking increased. In addition, it is likely that the rapid cooling near the mold walls prevented interdendritic eutectic flow, which further accentuated the interdendritic porosity.

The effect o f foam density on the casting porosity was readily observed. A s suggested earlier in Sections 4.2 and 4.5, the 1.3 p c f foam possibly generated higher volume fractions o f the liquid-EPS products than the 1.6 p c f foam. As a result, the probability o f entrapping the liquid-EPS residue in the casting increased for the 1.3 p c f foam castings. The measured porosity levels in the 1.3 p c f castings confirmed this prediction.

On the macroscopic level, entrapped liquid-EPS formed voids o f several millimeters in w idth (Figure 93). Unfortunately, inspection o f the micrographs did not reveal a characteristic microcavity (porosity) which could be solely attributed to the presence o f the liquid-EPS residue.

The casting porosity was seen to be influenced by the pouring temperature. This was attributed to the effect o f the metal tem perature on the physical properties o f the liquid-EPS products.

116

4.9.1 Pouring temperature: 660 °C
The measured porosity values for the 660 °C pouring temperature castings suggest two distinct trends with respect to the casting section thickness. As Figure 130 indicates, in vacuum castings, the porosity decreased with increasing section thickness. In gravity castings, the porosity increased w ith increasing section thickness.

In vacuum casting trials, the relationship between the casting porosity and the section thickness was seen to associate with the relative ease o f the liquid-EPS products removal from the casting cavity. The surface area o f the 2.5 cm thick horizontal bar was 40% greater than that o f the 1.0 cm thick bar. D ue to the greater surface area o f the 2.5 cm thick bar, lower mass fraction o f the EPS pyrolysis products passed through a unit area o f the ceramic coating. As a result, the possibility o f ceramic coating clogging was reduced in the thicker horizontal bars. To this end, the application o f vacuum was beneficial. However, the effect o f vacuum on the overall casting porosity was detrimental. A s observed in Table 19, the average casting porosity increased in vacuum castings, relative to the gravity castings.

I ypically, the porosity levels are expected to increase with increasing .foam density, due to the increased m ass o f EPS present in the casting. H ow ever, the results o f this research suggest that the average casting porosity w as higher in the 1.3 p c f foam castings, w hen compared to the Eh p c f foam castings. This observ ation again supports the suggestion that due to the poor head fusion, the 1.3 p c f foam generated large quantities o f the liquidEPS producis (due to the premature collap se o f the solid-E P S foam ahead o f the m olten metal front), \^hich increased the casting porosity. l ocations near the m ctal-m old interlace ollen exhibited interdendritic .shrinkage porosity nepvorks, as shown in figu re 133 and Figure 134.

Casting trials with the 700 ®C pouring tem perature exhibited sim ilar trends o f porosity developm ent (as the 660 °C pouring temperature trials) with respect to the increasing section thickness. As Figure 136 suggests, for vacuum castings, the porosity decreased w ith the increasing section thickness, while for gravity castings, the porosity increased with increasing section thickness. Explanation o f these trends was presented in Section 4.9.1.

Comparison o f entries o f Table 19 and Table 20 suggests that in the case o f the vacuum casting trials, the increased pouring temperature caused a decrease in the casting porosity. This effect was again correlated with the extraction o f the liquid-EPS residue from the casting cavity. A t higher pouring tem peratures and with application o f vacuum, the wetting, w icking and transport o f the liquid-EPS residue through the ceramic coating into the surrounding sand was accelerated, w ith attendant decrease o f casting porosity.

It appears from Figure 140 that, w ith increasing metal velocity, the casting porosity levels decreased. Considering the fact that the metal flow was laminar for all casting trials, then the increased porosity levels in slow-metal velocity cases could be correlated with the difficulty o f rem oving liquid-EPS products from the casting cavity. For a slow m oving metal front, the partially solidified chunks obstructed the paths along which the pyrolysis products could escape, thus possibly causing an increase o f the casting porosity.

125

4.9.3 Criterion functions
The criterion functions presented in Section 2.7 were evaluated to estimate the average casting porosity in the horizontal bars. Past research indicates that these criterion functions may require m odification for a

particular casting process and alloy to increase prediction accuracy. Currently, there is no published literature on the validity o f these models for the LFC o f magnesium alloys.

The criterion functions were evaluated at casting locations where optical porosity values were measured. This allowed ranking o f the criterion functions based on their accuracy to predict casting porosity.

It was observed, that the Freezing Index (FI) and the LCC functions were overestim ating the porosity values by two orders o f magnitude. The Gradient Acceleration Param eter (GAP) underestim ated the porosity values by one order o f magnitude. Such trends were observed for the majority o f the casting locations. Therefore, these functions were not adequate for the prediction o f porosity levels in LFC o f magnesium alloys. As Figure 141 indicates, the N iyam a function predicted porosity values w ithin the same order o f magnitude as measured by the optical image analysis.

The Niyama function, which is based on the thermal gradient and the cooling rate o f the solidifying casting, was seen to relate to the developm ent o f shrinkage porosity in the casting. The presence and the volum e fraction o f the generated liquid-EPS products was not accounted for in the N iyam a criterion function. As Section 4.4 shows, formation o f the liquid-EPS residue seemed to affect the casting density, soundness and porosity to a great extent. Incorporation o f this information into the criterion function is a complex problem dealing with therm o-physical phenomena associated w ith th e LFC process. Lack o f accurate information regarding the liquid-EPS generation made the use o f the criterion function inaccurate. Aspects such as: foam density, level o f bead fusion, metal front profile, alloy superheat and freezing range w ould have to be quantitatively assessed to improve the prediction model accuracy.

4.9.4 Section summary

The porosity levels in all castings were relatively low due to the effective use o f the protective atmosphere during m elting operations.

The porosity results suggest that application o f vacuum caused entrapment o f the liquid-EPS products in the casting cavity. As a result, the porosity was seen to be higher in vacuum castings than in the gravity castings. Further, the variance o f the porosity data was also seen to increase as a rèsult o f the applied vacuum.

The foam density and bead fusion were seen to affect the casting porosity. Poorly fused low-density foam possibly generated m ore liquid-EPS products which were later entrapped in the casting cavity, thus increasing casting porosity.

Shrinkage porosity networks were observed to form near the casting m old walls. These networks were seen to extend to the surface o f the casting, potentially creating surface pores. Criterion functions w ere evaluated and compared to the experimental data. W ith the exception o f the N iyam a function, the general porosity prediction models w ere inadequate for LFC o f m agnesium alloys. The N iyam a function seem ed to correctly predict the trends o f shrinkage porosity developm ent along the length o f the bar.

4.10 M icrostructure o f the casting
The microstructure o f the cast specimens was analyzed by the optical microscopy techniques. Image analysis software was used to determine the grain structure and the morphology o f the M givAl^ precipitate.

In general, it was observed that in locations where slow cooling rates prevailed, the shape o f the MgiyAbz phase resembled the equilibrium -like (spherical morphology) precipitate. In these cases, the M g ^A In phase formed from the supersaturated M g-A l solid solution w hile it was heterogeneously dispersed throughout the prim ary magnesium grains.

However, due to the relatively high cooling rates associated w ith the LFC process, the maj ority o f the cast specimens contained the lam ellar (eutectic) M g n A l,; precipitate. This precipitate preferentially formed on the grain boundaries and in the interdendritic regions o f the prim ary magnesium dendrites. Thus, the distribution was also heterogeneous.

In several instances, formation o f both types o f the precipitate was observed within the same casting. Tins suggests a localized heterogeneity in solidification conditions w ithin the casting.

Development o f the non-equilibrium precipitate was correlated with the thermal analysis data. Thermal undercooling, w hich occurs during non-equilibrium solidification, was registered by the cooling curve analysis. In addition, constitutional undercooling was established as a result o f non-equilibrium solidification (with associated compositional changes). Consequently, solute was rejected by the solid phase into the liquid phase, w hich resulted in solute segregation, as evidenced by the microstructure.

The image analysis results suggest a correlation between the casting density and the percent area o f the eutectic precipitate.

129

4.10^1 Constitutional undercooling in the AZ91E alloy
Inspection o f the m etallographic specimens revealed the presence o f the lamellar non-equilibrium M gi 7 A l ]2 precipitate. U nder equilibrium cooling conditions, the AZ91E alloys do not generate this kind o f the precipitate. However, the relatively high cooling rates associated with the casting process caused constitutional undercooling.

Based on the equilibrium phase diagram. Figure 7, it is likely that as the solidification fi^ont advanced, solute (aluminum) was redistributed at the solid-liquid interface. In particular, the solute was possibly rejected by the solid phase into the liquid phase. The reason for and the mechanism o f solute rejection by the solid phase is discussed in the following paragraph. Table 21 demonstrates the developm ent o f solute levels in the solid and liquid phases during casting solidification.

During the solute rejection process, a solute-rich region ahead o f the solid-liquid (S-L) interface develops. The concentration profile o f this region is schematically illustrated in Figure 142. This curve corresponds to the solute concentration profile in the eutectic liquid ahead o f the solid-liquid interface at the eutectic temperature.

An important consequence o f the solute accumulation was the possible breakdown o f the planar solidliquid interface into a more random interface.®^ As a result, the grain structure changed from the columnar type, to a mix o f cellular and dendritic grain structure. This change occurred because o f the liquid well ahead o f the solid-liquid interface had a lower solute concentration and hence a higher equilibrium freezing temperature than the liquid at the solid-liquid interface. As a result, any perturbation at the solidliquid interface would prom ote growth o f the prim ary dendrite stalks into the constitutionally (chemically) undercooled liquid. Such growth would occur even if the liquid far ahead o f the solid-liquid interface was infact hotter than the liquid near the solid-liquid interface. Therefore, constitutional undercooling was considered as a possible mechanism affecting the growth o f dendrites in the castings.

The magnitude o f constitutional undercooling was governed by the temperature gradients present ahead o f the solid-liquid interface. A schematic illustration o f the effect o f the thermal gradient on the extent o f the constitutional undercooling is presented in Figure 143. 131

The thermal gradient, which was defined as the slope o f the temperature profile ahead o f the solid-liquid interface, possibly governed the size o f the region where constitutional undercooling occurred. High thermal gradients decreased the thickness o f the constitutionally undercooled region and vice versa.

As a result o f the solute gradients ahead o f the solid-liquid interface, the concentration o f the solid magnesium grains was not uniform. The m agnesium dendrites / grains formed in solid layers o f possibly varying solute concentration. The dendrite center possibly had the lowest concentration (3.3 wt%Al), w hile the outermost edge o f the dendrite solidified with approximately 12.7 wt%Al. The interdendritic region, containing eutectic liquid, solidified w ith the eutectic composition o f ~ 33 wt%AI. Figure 144 shows the estimated solute concentration profile for the magnesium dendrites and the interdendritic region at the eutectic temperature. The extremities o f the plot, i.e., interdendritic distances o f 0 and 1, correspond to the centers o f adjacent dendrite stalks. The solute content between these two stalks varied accordmg to the solute redistribution criteria imposed by the M g --M gi 7 A l , 2 phase diagram.

The presence o f solute gradients within the magnesium grains / dendrites resulted in a cored microstructure. This cored m icrostructure was observed in all castings. A n example o f this microstructure is seen in Figure 145. In this micrograph, different shades o f gray represent different solute concentrations. This figure also clearly shows, that the inter-dendritic regions solidified w ith the lamellar eutectic phase (dark gray), while the prim aiy magnesium grains contained only lim ited amount o f dissolved aluminum (light gray).

4.10.2 Effect o f cooling rate on the M gi 7Alj2 precipitate
In general, the casting microstructure consisted o f the primary magnesium grains surrounded by the eutectic microconstituent M gnAlia. The mass fraction and the exact location o f the precipitated M g n A ln phase varied throughout the casting and seemed to depend on the localized cooling conditions.

In investigating the effect o f the coolmg rate on the as-cast alloy m icrostructure and the M g n A l ,2 precipitate, attention was given to the magnitude o f the thermal gradients in the horizontal bars. The presence o f the thermal gradients affected the solute redistribution kinetics at the solid-liquid interface (Section 4.10.1). The effect o f the thermal gradients on the casting microstructure was explained using the constitutional undercooling criterion function.

In the case o f the binary eutectic alloys, it is possible to define a partition coefficient, kp, which is the ratio o f the composition o f the solid and the liquid phases at the solid-liquid interface, Cs and C l, respectively:

kp = ( ^ / C ^

(T%

Since the solidus and liquidus lines o f the M g-M gnAlia phase diagram are straight, the value o f kp was approximately constant for the solidifying AZ91E system.

Theory suggests,^^ that the nature o f the solute build-up ahead o f the solid-liquid interface is a function o f the solid phase growth velocity, Vs-l, the partition coefficient, kp, the diffusivity o f the solute in the liquid, D i, and the slope o f the liquidus line, m. Therefore, these solidification variables w ere related to the thermal gradient to develop a criterion for the occurrence o f constitutional undercooling.

The thermal gradient (G) is proportional to the rate o f change o f the solute ahead o f the solid-liquid interface (dC t/dx') and the slope o f the liquidus line (m).®' Hence, the general constitutional undercooling criterion is given by:

G < -m dx'
j:'=0

(16)

134

The characteristic distance for this relationship, x the solute boundary layer thickness, S.

is given by D i / Vs.l, which can also be identified as

For most alloy systems, the steady state concentration boundary layer profile, C l *, is estim ated as:

.68

Q * = Co + Where; Co --Bulk solute concentration

k

(17)

Substituting this expression into Equation 16 and differentiating, the constitutional undercooling criterion is obtained:

(18)

Therefore, as Equation 18 suggests, higher cooling rates (which generate high thermal gradients) decrease the solute boundary layer thickness. In this research, the M g n A ln percent area data obtained firom the im age analysis software did not show a definite correlation with the cooling rate, as observed in Figure 146. Therefore, it is possible that the range and the m agnitude o f the cooling rates investigated in this research w ere not sufficient to appreciably change the M gnAfia percent area.

The thermal analysis data suggest, however, that the cooling rate indeed affected the duration o f the eutectic reaction. A s Figure 147 suggests, increasing the cooling rate generally seemed to decrease the eutectic reaction time. This result agrees with the fact that higher cooling rates cause rapid casting solidification, thus decreasing time for any transformation to occur.

The microstructure near the m old walls often exhibited dendritic structure. Such a microstructure was attributed to the higher cooling rates resulting from the contact o f the molten metal with the relatively cool sand mold, which caused rapid grain nucléation and dendrite growth. Further, the relatively higher cooling rates also prom oted branching o f the prim my dendrite arms, in order to maintain chemical equilibrium o f the quickly solidifying M g-Al system. An example o f a highly dendritic microstructure is seen in Figure 148.

The microstructure in the center locations o f the casting was not strictly dendritic. Due to the relatively low cooling rates, a m icrostructure resembling the combination o f dendritic and cellular types formed, as observed in Figure 149.

The effect o f the horizontal bar section thickness on the as-cast microstructure was attributed to the variation o f the cooling rate associated w ith the different horizontal bars. In thinner sections, the cooling rates were higher, therefore facilitating more significant departure from equilibrium solidification conditions. Consequently, the grain nucléation rate, as well as the levels o f constitutional undercooling varied. The result was a decrease in grain size and a more pronounced solute segregation. The microstructure o f the thicker horizontal bars was representative o f the higher LSTs experienced by these bars. In such cases, the magnesium grains were relatively large due to the longer growth times. Further, the degree o f solute redistribution was different, since the size o f the interdendritic regions depended on the cooling rate. A progressive variation o f the microstructure in the 660 "C / 1.6 p c f / without vacuum casting trial is presented in Figure 150. This figure also shows that with the increased grain size, the M gnA li 2 precipitated in discrete regions o f the microstructure, whereas in the thinner horizontal bars, the M g n A ln phase formed throughout the microstructure. 138

It appears, that the initial cooling rate (i.e., the cooling rate experienced by the alloy immediately after crossing o f the liquidus line) significantly affected the grain morphology o f the as-cast microstructure.

For example, in Figure 150, the 2.5 cm thick horizontal bar experienced an initial cooling rate o f 0.2 °C/s. As a result o f this relatively slow cooling rate, the grain structure does not show the characteristic dendritic microstructure (branching o f prim ary dendrite arms). However, in the case o f a casting produced with 700 °C pouring temperature, 1.3 p c f foam, w ithout vacuum, the location at 7.6 cm from the sprue in the 1.5 cm thick bar experienced initial cooling rate o f 4.8 °C/s. As a result o f the relatively high cooling rate, the casting section was not solidifying under equilibrium conditions and a completely dendritic microstructure formed, as observed in Figure 151. D ue to the interlocking o f the dendrite arms, it is likely that the interdendritic regions w ere separated from one another. As a result, geom etric constraints were imposed on the growing M gnAftz phase. Therefore, the eutectic phase formed uniformly throughout the microstructure.

Formation o f the eutectic m icroconstituent M g n A ln appeared to correlate w ith the therm al gradients established in the horizontal bars. In the case o f the 1.5 cm thick horizontal bar o f the 700 °C / 1.6 p c f / without vacuum casting trial, the average thermal gradient along the length o f the bar was 3.9 °C/cm. However, in the 2.5 cm thick bar o f the 700 °C / 1.3 p c f / without vacuum casting trial, the gradient was 1.7 °C/cm. Figure 151 and Figure 152 show the microstructure o f the two bars, respectively. Since the gradient in the 1.5 cm thick bar was relatively high, the potential for constitutional undercooling decreased. As a result, formation o f the lamellar M g n A l^ phase decreased and a fibrous M g n A l^ precipitate formed instead.

It was also observed, that the amount o f the precipitated M g n A l,; phase seemed to vary along the length o f the horizontal bars.

Locations near the flow tip, where the cooling rates were relatively high, experienced rapid nucléation o f the primary magnesium grains. Consequently, the size o f the interdendritic regions decreased and the eutectic liquid was dispersed throughout the entire casting section, as depicted in Figure 153.

Casting sections near the sprue, however, rem ained hot for longer periods o f time, thus potentially allowing flow o f the low-melting point eutectic liquid. As a result, the eutectic liquid was pushed by the growing dendrites which allow ed the MgiyAha phase to precipitate as discrete islands randomly in the microstructure, as shown in Figure 154.

The unique features o f the M gnA hz precipitate, such as the formation o f lamellae or fibers, depended mainly on the solidification kmetics o f the casting. Specifically, it seems that formation o f the precipitate was governed by the degree o f departure from equilibrium cooling conditions.

4.10.3 Development o f the "equilibrium-like" precipitate
The "equilibrium-like" M g n A ln precipitate had a spherical m orphology and was seen to form w ithin the primary magnesium grains, as observed in Figure 155. This micrograph was taken firom the 1.5 cm thick bar at 2.5 cm distance from the sprue in the 660 °C / 1.6 p c f / w ith vacuum trial. It appears, that in this case, only limited fraction o f the lamellar precipitate formed on the grain boundaries.

Development o f the "equilibrium-like" precipitate was associated w ith the very slow cooling rates experienced by some casting locations. The precipitation mechanics were explained using the Mg-Al equilibrium phase diagram. A schematic portion o f a this phase diagram is illustrated in Figure 156. At point "A", the casting temperature fell below the liquidus temperature and small islands o f the primary aM g phase nucleated. The phase development entered the "a + Liquid" region and with further cooling, the temperature reached the solidus line, at which point all o f the liquid was consumed. At point "B", a solid solution o f M g and A1 formed.

D ue to the decreasing solid solubility o f aluminum in magnesium, further cooling o f the alloy caused the M gi 7 A li 2 phase to separate from the supersaturated solid solution o f a-M g and p -M g n A l^ phases, point "C". A t this instant, the M g n A ln particles observed in Figure 155 formed w ithin the magnesium grains.

Formation o f this lamellar precipitate vAas expected, sin ce the coolin g rates associated w ith the LFC process were too high to lavor equilibrium precipitation. Further, Ibrmation o f this precipitate suggested the presence o f constitutional undercooling and segregation phenom ena.

It is likely, that during solid iiication . it w as diflteult for the system to maintain chem ical equilibrium. This was caused by the relatively slow atom ic dlMusion rates in the solid phase, as compared to the diffusion rates in the liquid phase. A s a result, solute was rejected by the solid phase into the liquid. (Consequently, solute concentration gradients in the liquid ahead o f the solid-liquid interlace were established.

Due to the tnuch slow er diffusion rates in the solid phase, a depression o f the .solidus line w as o b se n ed. "The solidus line was shifted dow n-and-lelt from its original equilibrium position.

In the AZ91E alloy system, the eutectic reaction should occur at 437 °C. In the present study, however, the castings exhibited the eutectic reaction between 424 °C and 428 °C, a 9 -- 13 °C depression o f the solidus line. This proves that equilibrium conditions w ere not followed.

It was also observed, that the data collected in the present study suggest that castings produced under near-equilibrium solidification conditions (slow cooling) would indeed exhibit the eutectic reaction at 437 °C, as suggested by Figure 157.

Figure 157: Effect o f cooling rate on the eutectic temperature.

The following example explains the mechanism o f the solidus line shift:

Figure 158 shows a generic phase diagram. In this hypothetical alloy with 30 wt%B composition, solidification started at T,, where a solid solution o f composition ai formed. A t Tg the liquid was at composition Lz and the solid solution was o f composition az. Since solid diffusion was too slow to occur parallel with the crystal growth, not enough time was allowed to achieve uniformity in the solid (i.e., solute was rejected). Consequently, the solid composition was between a; and Uz, say a 'z. As the temperature decreased, the average composition departed still further fi'om the equilibrium conditions. A t the temperature o f T 3 , the average solid solution was o f composition a ' 3 instead

.

144

F o r equilibrium cooling, solidification should be complete at T 4 .. However, since the average composition o f the solid solution a ' 4 did not reach the overall composition o f the alloy, some liquid still remained. Solidification therefore continued until T 5 was reached. A t this temperature, the com position o f the solid solution a ' 5 coincided with the alloy composition and the solidification process was complete.

According to this example, the last liquid to solidity had a composition L5 , and was richer in solute than the last liquid which would solidify under equilibrium conditions. It is apparent then, that the higher the cooling rate, the greater the departure firom equilibrium, with attendant wider composition range o f the solidified grains.

D ue to the shifting o f the solidus line, phase development varied from that predicted by the equilibrium phase diagram. The liquid ahead o f the solid-liquid interface was enriched in solute up to the level o f reaching the eutectic composition (33 wt%Al). Prior to the crossing the eutectic isotherm, the liquid in the interdendritic regions o f the casting solidified with the eutectic solute concentration, forming alternating lamellae o f magnesium and aluminum. Figure 159 schematically illustrates the phase generation in the non-equilibrium cooling case.

4.10.5 Characterization of the MgiTAljj precipitate
The majority o f the precipitated M gi 7 A li 2 phase was o f the lamellar non-equilibrium type. Figure 161 to Figure 168 show representative casting microstructures for the different casting conditions (in cases where metallographic specimens for desired locations were not available, specimens at the nearest adjacent location were prepared to provide indication o f the microstructure o f the missing specimen).

A s expected, the lamellar M g n A ln phase formed on the grain boundaries, since the liquid enriched in the solute was continuously pushed by the growing m agnesium dendrites to the interdendritic regions. A t later stages o f solidification, sufficient concentrations o f solute and solvent elements were present to allow lateral atomic diffusion. This diffusion mechanism resulted in the formation o f alternating lamellae o f Mg and Al, with appreciable grain boundary migration, analogous to discontinuous precipitation. This is in agreement with the observations o f Nie.^^

However, in castings where the non-equilibrium lamellar precipitate formed, the partially divorced eutectic was present with islands o f M g phase in the inter-dendritic regions, as observed in Figure 171. These results correspond with the relative grain sizes, as suggested by N ave et. al.^*

The image analysis results suggest that in the 660°C pouring temperature casting trials, the percent area o f the precipitated M gnA hz phase was higher w hen compared to the 700 °C pouring tem perature casting trials. This trend was attributed to the lower cooling rates experienced in the 660 °C pouring temperature trials (as verified by Table 13). A s a result o f the lower cooling rates, the solidifying alloy was allowed more tim e for the precipitation reaction to occur.

The 1.5 cm thick bars often experienced a sudden increase in the M gnA li 2 percent area near the 8 cm distance from the sprue (Figure 174, (g) and (h)). The exact cause o f this behavior rem ains unknown. However, it was observed (Figure 175 and Figure 177) that the casting locations w here this anomaly occurred exhibited predominantly dendritic microstructure (high cooling rate). In these cases, the dendrites were seen to grow along the hexagonal directions o f the HCP magnesium crystals. The development o f the dendritic mierostructure suggests presence o f high solute gradients in the casting. It is possible that at locations where high solute gradients existed, the precipitation process caused the break down o f the lamellar M gi 7 A li 2 precipitate. Thus, ffagmented and degenerated fibrous structure was created, as seen in Figure 176.

4.10.6 Effect o f the MgijAlu precipitate on the casting density
Past research suggests/® that presence o f the low-melting point eutectics, such as the M gnAli^ phase, may allow eutectic flow before casting solidification is complete. Such eutectic flow may decrease the volume fraction o f shrinkage porosity, thus improving the level o f casting density.

The M gi 7 A lj 2 percent area data plotted in Figure 178 indeed suggest that formation o f the precipitate possibly affected the casting density, by allowing eutectic liquid flow, thereby eliminating some o f the shrinkage porosity.

Moreover, extending the trend line to the left, which corresponds to an alloy composition w ith minimal amount o f the M gi?Ain phase, suggests a casting density o f 1.81 g/cm^.

Image analysis software was used to determine the lamellar spacing between the centers o f two adjacent parallel lamellae. The lam ellar spacing o f the M g n A ln phase is regarded as an important characteristic o f the precipitate, since it affects the mechanical properties o f the alloy. The growth o f the lamellar eutectic was rationalized in terms o f the solidification kinetics o f the casting process. The fineness o f the lam ellar precipitate was explained by considering the energy changes associated with the phase development during solidification. Theory suggests,®^ that, for a constitutionally undercooled liquid ahead o f the solid-liquid interface, the net Gibbs free energy change is:

For a given undercooling there will be a minimum lamellar spacing, 1mm, obtained by setting AG in Equation 19 to zero. This is given by:

The value o f the interfacial energy, Ya/p, for the A Z91E alloy was not found in the literature. Tlierefore, typical low and high values o f this param eter were assessed. The low and the high possible values o f the minimal lamellar spacing, 1mm, were calculated w ith Ya/p = 0.1 and Ya/p = 1.0, respectively. Substituting appropriate values for the AZ91E magnesium alloy into Equation 20 (Appendix C), the minimum lamellar spacing was calculated to range between 0.017 pm and 0.17 pm.

It is evident, that the measured lamellar spacing values were significantly higher than the minimal lamellar spacing calculated via Equation 20. One reason for this discrepancy was attributed to the inability o f the optical microscope to resolve the very fine lamellae.

4.10.8 Section summary
The mierostructure developm ent was typically observed to follow the non-equilibrium solidification kinetics. Despite the occurrence o f the "equilibrium-like" M gnAlia precipitate forming in some casting bars, the majority o f the precipitate was o f the lamellar non-equilibrium type.

Constitutional undercooling and development o f solute boundary layer was attributed as the driving mechanism o f solute segregation. Consequently, the M g n A l^ phase was heterogeneously distributed throughout the casting mierostructure.

The casting cooling rate appeared to influence the degree o f solute segregation as well as the overall grain morphology. High prim ary a-M g nueleation rates were the result o f the high cooling rates, with attendant dispersion o f the M gnAliz phase. The effect o f vacuum, section thickness and pouring tem perature on the casting mierostructure were all based on their relationship w ith the alloy cooling rate.

It w as observed that the "equilibrium -like" precipitate favored the fully divorced eutectic mierostructure, w hile the lam ellar non-equilibrium precipitate formed the partially divorced eutectic mierostructure. In the case o f the lamellar precipitate, individual lamellae were observed to grow along the pyramidal planes o f the HCP m agnesium crystals.

The amount o f the precipitated M g n A l^ phase suggested correlation w ith the casting density. This licates the possibility o f eutectic flow prior to complete freezing o f the casting.

Chapter 5 --Conclusions
This research work culminated in a variety o f novel observations with respect to the casting quality o f magnesium alloy castings and the behavior o f the molten AZ91E alloy when cast by the LFC process. These relate to the effect o f vacuum, effect o f foam characteristics, thermal analysis, casting porosity and the M gi 7 A li 2 intermetallic phase.

1.

Effect o f vacuum

The presence o f vacuum caused the molten metal front to change from the conventional convex profile to a concave .profile. Further, application o f vacuum produced higher metal velocities relative to gravity casting. The effect o f vacuum was correlated with the increased extraction rates o f the liquid-EPS products from the casting cavity. Due to the effective removal o f the liquid-EPS products, the metal flow in vacuum castings resembled that o f open-cavity casting processes, where the metal velocity decreased w ith increasing distance from the sprue. On the contrary, gravity castings exhibited metal velocity oscillations, which suggest that metal flow was governed by the degradation rates o f the solid-EPS in the casting cavity.

Statistical analysis revealed that the application o f vacuum increased the variance o f the metal velocity for different section thicknesses. In addition, the combined results o f velocity and the therm al analysis suggest that during vacuum casting trials, the m etal flow continued beyond the dendrite coherency point, as evidenced by the partially solidified metal at the frozen metal fronts o f the horizontal bars.

2.

Effect o f foam characteristics

Foam density and bead fusion had a distinct impact on the casting fill and metal velocity. Superior mold filling o f the 1.6 p c f foam patterns was attributed to the relatively low liquid-EPS residue fraction present in the mold cavity, as compared to the 1.3 p c f foam castings. This anomalous behavior was attributed to the poor bead fusion o f the 1.3 p c f foam, which allowed premature degradation o f the solid-EPS foam well ahead o f the molten metal front. In addition, the metal velocity in the 1.6 p c f foam casting trials was seen to be higher than in the 1.3 p c f foam casting trials. This behavior was also explained by the presence o f the liquid-EPS products in the 1.3 p c f casting trials, which possibly accum ulated at the metal-mold interface, thus increasing the frictional forces imparted on the liquid metal flow. 167

Increasing the pouring tem perature improved the casting fillability. This result was attributed to the relatively easier solid-EPS and liquid-EPS removal process. However, increasing the pouring temperature also promoted metal penetration into the surrounding sand, with attendant casting surface defects.

3.

Thermal analvsis

The casting cooling rates were observed to impact the degree o f solute segregation, as well as the overall grain morphology. High prim ary a-M g nueleation rates were correlated with the high initial cooling rates, with a decrease in grain size and homogeneous dispersion o f the M gnAlia phase. Further, the results o f the thermal analysis enabled calculation o f parameters for Chvorinov's equation. The value o f the Chvorinov's constant for LFC o f magnesium alloys was calculated to be 324.6 and the value o f the Chvorinov's exponent was 1.4.

4.

Casting porositv

Shrinkage porosity was often observed in the casting bars forming as networks (not-connected), especially near the mold wall surfaces. The center regions o f the horizontal bars, however, contained only isolated pockets o f interdendritic cavities. The A dam 's riser model could be used to predict solidification shrinkage trends in gravity castings. Flowever, use o f this model was not possible for vacuum castings.

An attempt was made to apply thermal param eter based criterion functions to predict porosity. The N iyam a function was observed to predict the trends o f porosity within the same order o f magnitude for gravity and vacuum castings. This level o f accuracy was not achieved w ith some other known functions.

The application o f vacuum possibly prom oted the entrapment o f liquid-EPS products in the casting cavity thus increasing casting porosity (macroporosity).

168

5. Development o f the MeivAlj? phase

The AZ91E mierostructure development, in general, followed the non-equilibrium solidification kinetics. Despite the occurrence o f the "equilibrium -like" spherical M g n A ln precipitate forming in some casting bars, the majority o f the precipitate was o f the non-equilibrium lam ellar type. The "equilibrium-like" spherical precipitate favored the fully divorced eutectic mierostructure, while the lamellar nonequilibrium precipitate associated w ith the partially divorced eutectic mierostructure. In the case o f the lamellar precipitate, individual lamellae were observed to grow along the pyram idal planes o f the HCP magnesium crystals. Constitutional undercooling and the development o f solute boundary layer was identified as the driving mechanism o f solute segregation and developm ent o f the non-equilibrium lamellar precipitate.

169

Chapter 6 --Suggestions for Further W ork

1. Development o f a quantitative technique to assess bead fusion.

2. Development o f a m ethod to estimate the amount o f liquid-EPS residue present in the casting cavity.

3. M etal flow visualization with real time X-ray spectroscopy to validate the liquid-EPS development phenomena.

4. Development o f new porosity prediction model accounting for the presence o f liquid-EPS in the casting cavity.

5. Optimization o f the vacuum casting conditions to enable improved mold filling w ithout compromising the internal casting structure and surface finish quality.

6. Optimization o f the foam / ceramic slurry / mold m edia parameters to achieve optimal casting fill while preventing liquid-EPS entrapment.

1. Development o f image analysis software to determine the ratio o f the equilibrium and non-equilibrium M gnA li 2 precipitate in the casting.

Appendix C --M inimal lam ellar spacing

Using Equation 19, the minimal lam ellar spacing was calculated for the AZ91E alloy. Values o f appropriate variables were obtained from Reference 9.

ATu= 12.5 K A H f= 6.751x10" J/kg Te = 710.15 K

Substituting these values to Equation 19, the following expression was obtained:

F or the minimum lamellar spacing, ya/p ~ 0.1. Therefore:

1.683x10'" m = 0.0168 pm.

F or the maximum lamellar spacing, Ya/p = 1.0. Therefore; Àn,in= 1.683x10'^ m = 0.168 pm.
