ABSTRACT
ANAEROBIC DEGRADATION OF DIESEL FUEL CONTAMINATED WASTEWATER IN A FLUIDIZED BED RECTOR

Jonka Vezuli, 2004,

Master of Applied Science,

Chemical Engineering Department, Ryerson University

(

(This thesis studies the performance of the Anaerobic Fluidized Bed Reactor (AFBR) in treating diesel fuel-contaminated wastewater^ (The AFBR is a semi-cylindrical fluidized bed, with a capacity of 300 L and height of 2.90 m with sampling ports along the column length. Granular activated carbon (12-20 mesh) was used as the medium to immobilize biomass. Diesel fuel was the sole source of carbon for microorganisms. The system's COD removal capability and diesel fuel removal efficiency were measured at 100 mg/L, 200 mg/L, and 300 mg/L influent diesel fuel in the r e a c ^ . (Hydraulic Residence Time (HRT) varied for each set of experiments from 96 to 6 houi^ ^he system achieved diesel removal efficiency of more than 84.1 % for 300 mg/L influent diesel concentration for the maximum flowrate treated (1200 L/d) at a minimum HRT of 6 hours. This investigation confirms that anaerobic degradation of diesel-contaminated water can be carried out very effectively in the AFBR.

CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 1.1. Introduction

Diesel fuel hydrocarbons are considered common environmental pollutants, which have the potential to contaminate large quantities of groundwater (Van Stempvoort et al. 2000). Many diesel spills in groundwater reported by Environment Canada (1994) like those on: Nov. 26,1992 in Northern Quebec; Sept. 23,1993, in Laurel, NS; Mar. 7,1994, in Ashechewan Bay, ON; etc, are all indication of a constant environmental contamination problem in Canada. Certain aromatic hydrocarbons common in diesel fuel such as benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, and xylene are toxic, hazardous and carcinogenic chemicals to human health as stated in Health and Welfare Canada, (1989). In addition, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) including benzo(a)pyrene, benz(a)anthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, dibenz(a,h)anthracene, indeno[l,2,3]pyrene and chrysene are carcinogenic to human health as pointed out by Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR, 1990). There are two main potential sources of environmental pollution with diesel fuel according to Erickson, (2000): a) Continuous low-level inputs from roads surfaces and domestic waste; b) Major spillage from tankers, pipelines, and storage tanks. Initially accidental diesel spillage, for example, caused from customers at the service station contaminates the soil. Diesel fuel being a persistent chemical increases the chance for groundwater contamination. For aboveground diesel spills rainwater delivers diesel into sewage systems or large bodies of water. Rainwater acts as a carrier of the diesel fuel. While for diesel spills occurring deeper into the ground it contaminates aquifers used for drinking water (Perryman, 2003).

Microbial degradation occurs in nature reducing hydrocarbons in the soil and water over very long periods of time. Today the need for water has increased so much that naturally occurring biodegradative process to clean up contaminated groundwater is no longer sufficient. Advances in technology have made it easier to intensify and accelerate the process of diesel fuel degradation through bioremediation. The size of treatment process when treating wastewater can be reduced using high concentrations of bacteria. The use of attached growth is a means of obtaining very high concentration of bacteria. Fluidized bed reactors, among the attached growth processes, provide a dual advantage: they prevent clogging problems found in fixed beds, and they promote rapid transfer of material between the liquid and the biomass (Trinet et al. 1991). Aerobic microbial

degradation of diesel fuel hydrocarbons has been recognized and understood for a long time as shown in the study done by Rehm and Reiff, (1981). Aerobic biodégradation processes, while found to be effective in treating diesel fuel contamination, are often quite expensive when relying on oxygen carriers as observed by Boopathy (2003). Bouwer, (1992) concluded that the anaerobic conditions often prevail in contaminated groundwater because the O2 demand exceeds the O 2 supply. This thesis focuses on bioremediation of diesel-contaminated water using an Anaerobic Fluidized Bed Reactor.

1.2.

Objectives and Scope of the Thesis

A study was conducted at the Laboratory of Water and Wastewater Treatment and Technologies (LWWTT) to determine the feasibility of using the anaerobic fluidized bed reactor for the biodégradation of diesel fuel-contaminated wastewater. Diesel fuel is on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s pollutant priority list (Erickson, 2000). Aerobic degradation process was studied previously in the LWWTT using RBC and Three Phase Fluidized Bed Reactor. These studies found that the aerobic process is effective in treating diesel contamination although often quite expensive when relying on oxygen carriers. Anaerobic degradation is desirable because much of the contaminated groundwater is already at anaerobic conditions. The Anaerobic Fluidized Bed Reactor during this project was operated in a continuous-flow mode. The focal point of this thesis was to determine the feasibility of the anaerobic microorganisms to biodegrade diesel fuel in wastewater using the fluidized bed reactor. Diesel fuel concentration at influent, midpoint and effluent sampling ports in the reactor was determined using gas chromatographic/mass spectroscopic methods. The effect of operational conditions such as organic loading rate (OLR), hydraulic residence time (HRT) and influent diesel concentration was investigated to achieve the maximum diesel removal efficiency of the reactor.

CHAPTER 2. REVIEW OF EXISTING LITERATURE 2.1. Diesel Fuel

Diesel fuel is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons used for diesel engines (Blumer, 1976). Hydrocarbons are organic chemical compounds that consist of only carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms (ILPI, 2004). Diesel fuels consist mainly of saturate (paraffins and naphthenes) and aromatic hydrocarbons. Their relative distribution depends on the feedstocks and fuel processing schemes (Song et al. 2000). It should be noted that oil companies, through their refineries, generally vary the mix of hydrocarbons in the fuels they supply to suit the demand, climate and the season of the year. They include more components with low boiling point ranges in cold climates and in winter, and vice versa in hot weather; the composition of diesel fuels can therefore be significantly different (Garrett, 1991). Diesel fuel is a blend of high-molecular-weight fractions of crude oil that come off in distillation after gasoline. Diesel fuel composition varies greatly and includes mostly C 9 to C 20 hydrocarbons with a boiling point range of about 160 to 380°C (Huang et al. 1989). Molecular components of diesel fuel are listed in Table 1. Saturated H ydrocarbons are dominant diesel components that include normal paraffins (n-paraffins), isoparaffins, and cycloparaffins (naphthenes). Usually long chain alkanes with carbon numbers in the range of C 9 -C20 are the major paraffinic components. Alkylcyclohexanes, decahydronaphthalenes and perhydrophenanthrenes are typical examples of 1-ring to 3-ring cyeloalkanes in diesel fuels (Song et al. 2000).

Arom atic compounds in diesel fuels are mainly alkylated benzenes. indanes. naphthalenes, tetralins, biphenyls, acenaphthenes, phenanthrenes, anthracenes, and naphthenophenanthrenes. Diaromatic hydrocarbons with naphthalene-type structure are the most abundant aromatic components in diesel fuel (Huang et al. 1989). Trace amounts of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with three or more ring aromatic compounds such as chrysenes, pyrenes, benzanthracenes, and perylenes can also be present in diesel fuel (Hsu, 2000).

2.2.

Diesel Fuel in Groundwater

Over eight million Canadians residing in urban and rural areas rely on groundwater for their domestic water supply (Environment Canada, 2004). Groundwater first becomes contaminated when diesel fuel hydrocarbons are partially dissolved or mixed in waters recharging the aquifer. Some examples of diesel fuel groundwater contamination are via pipeline and storage tanks leaks (both above and underground), tanker and rig accidents, and diesel spills during transfer at service stations (Perryman, 2003). To comprehend the question of why diesel fuel is so undesirable and unwanted in water we have to look in its properties and composition. Diesel fuel composition (as shown in Table 1) includes more than 90% saturated hydrocarbons (Paraffins and Cycloparaffins) and less than 10% aromatic hydrocarbons (Alkyl Benzenes, Indanes +Tetralins, Indenes, Alkyl-

Naphthalenes, Acenaphthenes/Biphenyls, Acenaphthalenes/Fluorenes). Diesel fuel is on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) priority pollutant list. The selection of priority pollutants is based upon toxicity to mammals and persistence of the compound (Eriksson, 2000). The Alberta Management of Underground Storage Tanks (MUST)

Guidelines (Alberta MUST. 1990) should be referred to in the absence of Ontario Criteria (for Drinking Water/Aquatic Life) standards. The MUST guidelines set the standards for TPH-diesel fuel levels in groundwater; < 0.2 mg/1 (level I) in High Sensitivity Sites < 50.0 mg/1 (level H) in Moderate Sensitivity Sites < 200.0 mg/1 (level HI) in Low Sensitivity Sites Taking into consideration the cleanup standards for any carcinogenic (such as benzene, PAHs) and any hazardous (ethylbenzene, toluene, xylenes and naphthalenes) component

of diesel fuel in groundwater is required. These groundwater cleanup standards should be met for example, a) Benzene has the Maximum Concentration Limit (MCL) of 5 ppb (parts per billion); b) Xylene has the MCL of 10 ppm; c) Ethylbenzene has the MCL of 0.7 ppm; d) Toluene has the MCL of 1 ppm; e) Benzo (a) pyrene has the MCL of 0.2 ppb. Cookson (1995) indicated that compounds resistant to biodégradation under certain conditions are known as persistent or refractory. Diesel fuel is a refractory chemical regarded as resistant to biodégradation (Metcalf and Eddy, 2002). Some important conditions that support microbial activity include utilizing a suitable electron donor and choosing the proper microbial species. The diesel fuel degradation is also affected by the molecular composition of the hydrocarbons, a characteristic that is directly related to the bioavailability of these compounds, and as a consequence, the biodégradation rate may be altered (Huesemann, 1995).

2.3.

Anaerobic Fluidized Bed Reactor

Anaerobic Fluidized Bed Reactors have been employed for the last three decades in the biotechnology industry and in the treatment of wastewater. The Anaerobic Fluidized Bed Reactor (AFBR) is a secondary biological wastewater treatment process. It combines the advantages of both conventional suspended-growth reactors and fixed-film reactors (Fox, 1989). The solid phase is formed by porous particles or support medium. This support medium consists of small particles that provide a large surface area for biofilm growth. The fluidized carriers or support media can be plastic beads, sand grains, granular activated carbon (GAC), lava rocks, or other small solids that are resistant to abrasion. The upward velocity called fluidizing velocity of the fluid must be sufficient to

maintain the carriers in suspension and this depends upon the density of the carriers relative to that of water, the carrier diameter and shape, and the amount of biomass that is attached. Fluidized bed reactors have great surface area per unit reactor volume, which allows shorter Hydraulic Residence Time (HRT) for the same degree of treatment in a given volume (Vigneswaran et al. 1986). Biomass concentrations in Fluidized Bed Reactors are often one order of magnitude greater than biomass concentrations found in conventional suspended-growth reactors (Fox, 1989). A high concentration of biomass develops a thin biofilm on the solids that maximizes contact between substrate and biomass and minimizes mass transport limitations. The biofilm or slime layer adsorbs the organic material from the liquid. As the microorganisms grow the thickness of the slime layer increases. Biofilm thickness must be controlled to prevent washout of particles whose density will decrease due to attached biomass (Shieh et al. 1981). Yoda et al. (1987) reported that the growth rate of anaerobic microorganisms is very slow therefore the increase in biofilm thickness did not have a severe impact on the effective density of particles.

2.3.1. Advantages of Anaerobic Fluidized Bed Reactor
Anaerobic Fluidized Bed Reactor is applied in wastewater treatment because of its several advantages that derive directly or indirectly from the ability to provide high biomass concentrations and relatively high organic loadings (Metcalf and Eddy, 2002). The following are some of the most important advantages of AFB Reactors: · · Liquid like behaviour, easy to control and automate. Applicable for large or small scale operations.

· Heat and mass transfer rates are high, requiring smaller surfaces (Metcalf and Eddy, 2002). · Low hydraulic head loss combined with better hydraulic circulation. · Easy removal or addition of particles. · Ability to operate at low residence times and/or higher organic loading rates. · Greater surface area available per unit of reactor volume. · Elimination of bed clogging and channeling (Bigmami et al. 1991). · A minimal biomass sloughing with the virtual absence of biomass washout (Bigmami et al. 1991). Further, Cooper and Atkinson (1981) claimed the following advantages for biological fluidized bed reactors: · The high biomass concentration achieved in the reactor leads to a small plant design, which could reduce the land area requirement by up to 80 per cent relative to conventional treatments. · · No moving parts. Reduced capital cost due to smaller reactor volumes and minimal space requirements. The high recycle ratio generally used in AFBR in order to achieve fluidization gives another advantage for AFBR. During anaerobic conversions large amounts of CO 2 are generated so the effluent tends to be alkaline. The effluent when mixed with the fresh influent provides enough alkalinity for pH control and stabilization (Marin et al. 1999).

2.3.2. Disadvantages of Anaerobic Fluidized Bed Reactor
Some of the main disadvantages of the fluidized bed reactor are listed below: · Temperature gradient reactions are not possible (Gupta, 1999). · Limits in particle size distribution. · Complex hydrodynamics make design and scale up difficult and requires skilled professionals to operate. · High pumping power required fluidizing the bed (Metcalf and Eddy, 2002).

· The cost of the media in the fluidized bed reactor. · The startup time period is relatively high (Metcalf & Eddy, 2002). · The need to carefully control bed fluidization. The fluidizing velocity must be sufficient for fluidization, but not so high that carriers are washed from the reactor (Rittmann and McCarty, 2001). · · Fines produced by particle breakup can be an operational problem. Pipe and vessel walls erode due to collisions of particles.

· Recycling of effluent may be necessary to achieve bed expansion, which makes the system more complex (Vigneswaran et al, 1986). · Insufficient design data (Bolanos, 2000).

2.3.3. Principles of Fluidization

Fluidization occurs when a bed of particles is made to behave like a liquid by passing of a fluid (liquid, gas or liquid and gas) at an upflow velocity above the minimum

10

fluidization velocity. Some fluidization characteristics of a Fluidized Bed Reactor are listed in the following sections.

A. Minimum Fluidization Velocity
Minimum fluidization velocity is necessary to fluidize a bed of particles. If the upflow velocity is not high enough the bed stays fixed and operates as a packed bed, while fluid flows between the interstitial spaces. However as the fluid flow is increased, the bed pressure drop increases until a maximum value is reached corresponding to the bed weight per unit of area. The frictional pressure drop of a fluidized bed column packed with solids is equal to the hydrostatic pressure drop of the bed. Several correlations exist to calculate minimum fluidization velocity in terms of Reynolds number. The wellknown Ergun Equation (Ergun, 1952) for minimum fluidization is written as:

A description of these symbols is given in pages xv-xvi. In the Eqn.l,

(2)
and Archimedes Number is given as: (3) When 8mf and < t)s are not known. Wen and Yu (1966) proposed the following correlation of the minimum fluidization velocity:

=((33.7)^+(0.0408)^ A r ) ^ - (33.7)

for

0.001 <Rcmf< 4000

(4)

11

Later on Chen (1987) added the shape factor, (j)s, to the correlation and suggested the following equation for non spherical particles:

Re^f =j^(33.7(|)°*°f +(0.0408(t)^""'^f

-(33.7(j)°*°)

(5)

Therefore the minimum fluidization velocity can be calculated by rearranging the Reynolds number in Eqn. 2:

= - f ^ dpPi

(6)

B.

Terminal Velocity

To eliminate the carry over of particles from a Fluidized Bed during experimental runs the liquid velocity has to be maintained between t/mf and C A . Terminal velocity, £/t, is the constant velocity that the free falling particles experience in a stagnant medium (Alvarez-Cuenca, 1995). In calculating the terminal velocity the smallest size of solids present in the bed are used to make sure that fines are not entrained and carried out of the top of the bed. The carrier terminal velocity is calculated by balancing the gravitational, buoyancy and drag forces for a particle:

~
The gravitational force is equal to the weight of the particle:

(8) The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid replaced by the particle:

Where, Co is the drag coefficient and Ap is the cross sectional area of the particle Substituting in Eqn. 7 we get:

Recycle Ratio

A very high degree of effluent recycle is usually required in the Anaerobic Fluidized Bed in order to achieve the high HRT. The recycle ratio, R is given as the ratio of recycle flow rate (Q r) to the feed flow rate (Q ): R = Q /Q (19)

The use of effluent recycle has its advantages and disadvantages. The main disadvantage is that recycle requires a large amount of energy. However, the following advantages listed below surpass the disadvantages (Marin et al. 1999; Vigneswaran et al, 1986): · Help neutralize the pH of the incoming wastewater and reduce the alkalinity required (see section 2.3.1.). · · · The effect of toxic biodegradable compounds is reduced. Minimize the effect of shock loadings. Compensate for variability of influent flow rate.

This would result in the system providing intimate contact between the biomass and the diesel fuel contaminated wastewater (NYSERDA, 1987). When a high Hydraulic Residence Time is required to achieve the desired removal rates, a high recycling rate should be employed.

Economics on A Comparative Evaluation of Aerobic and Anaerobic Biodégradation Processes

The degradation of diesel fuel hydrocarbons in groundwater and consequently the economics of the process are strongly influenced by the experimental conditions used. In this investigation the degradation of diesel fuel hydrocarbons has been carried out using an anaerobic fluidized bed reactor treating up to 1200 L/d under different operating

14

conditions such as HRT, OLR and influent diesel fuel concentration. Economies on a comparative evaluation of aerobic and anaerobic fluidized bed processes include three representative parameters: a) the annual operational cost; b) the cost of construction and installation; and c) income from biogas produced. Annual operational cost involves annual maintenance charges, cost of materials required for the bioprocess, labor requirement, chemical consumptions and energy requirement. Capital investment depends on land requirement, buildings and constructions. Operational costs of the aerobic biodégradation processes are high because of oxygen carriers, high aeration (power) and high sludge disposal. Moreover, the sludge (biomass) produced in aerobic processes has to be stabilized in classic anaerobic digesters before it can be safely disposed of (Sanders et al. 1996). However, the anaerobic biodégradation processes often require high recycling (power) and sludge disposal (low sludge production in comparison with the sludge production in aerobic processes), which increases the anaerobic process operational costs. The expenditure of sludge disposal assuming that sludge disposal would be entirely landfilled costs about $ 20 /ton dry sludge (Yoon et al. 2004). According to Gavrilescu, (2002) the expenditure for sludge disposal in anaerobic fluidized bed processes was one-tenth of the expenditure in aerobic fluidized bed processes. Furthermore in anaerobic fluidized bed processes no aeration energy is needed. Since they are closed systems, the anaerobic processes lead to odor reduction during operation. Investment costs for an anaerobic fluidized bed process are often higher than those for an aerobic fluidized bed process (Gavrilescu, 2002). According to NYSERDA, (1987) the average annual payment-capital costs are $1,644,500 for aerobic fluidized bed and $1,512,000 for anaerobic fluidized bed for the same level of treatment

15

achieved. Anaerobic biodégradation processes produce as byproduct a combustible gas called biogas, which contains 50-60 % methane, 30-40 % carbon dioxide, 1-5 % hydrogen and traces of nitrogen, hydrogen sulphide and water vapors (Duggal et al. 1987). While both aerobic and anaerobic fluidized bed processes have their advantages and disadvantages on the basis of a comparative evaluation, the anaerobic process was found to be the cheapest.

2.5.

Anaerobic Biological Treatment

Numerous persistent organic compounds are degraded under anaerobic conditions, with the compound serving as a carbon or energy source for the biomass production. Although it is known that anaerobic microorganisms will degrade organic carbon, including petroleum hydrocarbons, in the absence of molecular oxygen, the biochemical mechanisms underlying the initial enzymatic oxidation reactions are largely less understood (Ball et al. 1996). Anaerobic degradation of diesel fuel hydrocarbons in soil was studied thoroughly using electron acceptors such as nitrate (Wilson and Bower, 1997; Alexander, 1999), ferric iron (Straub and Buchholz-Cleven, 1998) and sulfate (Brock et al. 1997; Alexander, 1999). According to Wiedemeier et al. (1999) anaerobic biodégradation is the most significant working process to remove benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene from groundwater. When diesel fuel hydrocarbons enter the groundwater system, rapid depletion of dissolved oxygen caused by increased levels of aerobic microbial respiration result in the establishment of anaerobic conditions (Fox, 1989). Certain requirements must be met for the anaerobic bacteria to degrade diesel fuel hydrocarbons such as absence of dissolved oxygen; availability of carbon sources for

16

example diesel fuel hydrocarbons; electron acceptors and essential nutrients; and proper ranges of pH, temperature, salinity, and redox potential. Depending on the type of electron acceptor present [nitrate, Fe (HI), Mn (IV), sulfate], pH conditions, and redox potential, the anaerobic biodégradation can occur by denitrification, Mn (IV) reduction, Fe (HI) reduction, sulfate reduction, or methanogenesis. These electron acceptors have a lower redox potential than oxygen and the rate of degradation may be lower (Erickson, 2000). Common species of microorganisms often associated with the degradation of diesel fuel hydrocarbons are listed in Table 2. Marquez-Rocha et al (2001) suggested that the biodégradation of diesel fuel hydrocarbons is often limited due to the low water solubility of these hydrocarbons.

Variations in the individual population of the biological community occur throughout the fluidized bed reactor with changes in organic loading, hydraulic loading, influent wastewater composition, pH and temperature (Metcalf and Eddy, 2002).

17

2.5.1. Effect of Temperature
Anaerobic degradation is strongly influenced by temperature and can be grouped under one of the following categories: Psychrophilic (0-20°C), mesophilie (20-42°C) and thermophilic (42-75°C) (Maier et al. 2000). In the mesophilie range, the bacterial activity and growth decrease by one half for each 10°C drop below 35°C (Metcalf and Eddy, 2002). Thus lower temperatures require longer degradation time.

2.5.2. Effect of pH
Anaerobic reactions are highly pH dependent. The optimal pH range for anaerobic microorganisms is 6.1-13 (Maier et al. 2000). It is essential that wastewater contain enough buffer capacity to neutralize and prevent the build-up of localized acid zones. In general, sodium bicarbonate is used for supplementing the alkalinity since it is the only chemical that gently shifts the equilibrium to the desired value without disturbing the physical and chemical balance of the fragile mierobial population.

2.5.3. Effect of Nutrients
The microorganisms in the anaerobic degradation process require micronutrients and trace elements sueh as nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, nickel, cobalt, zinc, manganese and copper for optimum growth. Although these elements are needed in extremely low concentration, the lack of these nutrients has an adverse effect upon the microbial growth and performance (Maier et al. 2000).

18

2..6. GAC as an Attachment Medium
The removal of organic matter by a combination of adsorption and biological degradation in the Granular Activated Carbon Anaerobic Fluidized Bed Reactor (GACAFBR) was investigated first by Suidan et al. (1991). The GAC acted primarily as a support media for the attachment and growth of bacteria that form the biofilm. However, the adsorptive capacity of the GAC provides a second benefit in that it can cut-off peaks of influent concentration through adsorption, and latter desorbs the contaminants when the bacteria have reduced the aqueous phase concentration as found by Maloney et al. (2002). Fox et al. (1990) successfully used Granular Activated Carbon in an Anaerobic Fluidized Bed Reactor for anaerobic treatment of phenols formaldehyde contaminated wastewater. The GAC-AFB reactor was also proven to be an excellent treatment method for treating chlorinated hydrocarbons and treating soil wash fluids of PAH (polyaromatics hydrocarbons) contaminated soil, according to studies conducted by Flora et al. (1993) and Moteleb et al. (2002), respectively. Some benefits of using GAC as a packing material in Anaerobic FBR are as listed: · Higher biomass concentration maintained due to porous structure of GAC (Fox, 1989). · Adsorption properties may help acclimate and enhance biomass degradation of toxic compounds by providing more exposure time. The main limitation of GAC is the high cost of activated carbon, but for certain types of industrial and hazardous wastewaters the use of activated carbon is necessary.

19

CHAPTERS. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS 3.1. Experimental Facility

The anaerobic degradation of diesel fuel synthetic wastewater was carried out in the AFBR at the LWWTT at Ryerson University. Some of the equipment used in this project were: the fluidized bed reactor, vacuum stripper, water tank, feed tank. Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer, dissolved oxygen meter, spectrophotometer and pH meter. A more detailed list of these equipments will be discussed in the following sections.

A. Vacuum Stripper
To create anaerobic conditions it was important to remove dissolved oxygen from the water. Vacuum strippers are relatively economic for small amounts of water and they eliminate environmental interferences and problems associated with the use of oxygen scavengers (Bolanos, 2000). The vacuum stripper consisted of four sections mounted together using rubber gaskets to prevent air leakage. The column was made of clear PVC material with an internal diameter of 100 cm and a total height of 2.8 m. The packing material used was tri-packs (hollow spherical shaped packing made of injection moulded plastic), with 157 m^/m^specific surface area and 0.05 m nominal diameters. Vacuum strippers prevent plugging, fouling, nestling and wall channeling (Diaz, 2003). Prior to preparing the wastewater, tap water (cold and hot) filled the water tank and it was properly mixed. The water temperature was monitored in the range 30 ± 1 °C. The water

20

from the tank was then fed to the vacuum stripper column by means o f the pressure drop between the vacuum stripper and the atmospheric pressure on the water tank.

Vacuum stripper decreases the dissolved oxygen of tap water to 0.1-0.3mg/l (see section 4.3.) by means of reducing the internal absolute pressure to 20 in. Hg absolute. Then the deaerated water from the bottom of the vacuum stripper was pumped into the feed tank (as shown in Figure 1).

Anaerobic Fluidized Bed Reactor (AFBR)

The Anaerobic Fluidized Bed Reactor is the heart of this project. It consists of a semicylindrical column made of transparent PVC with internal diameter of 74 cm and a total height of 2.9 m. A schematic of the AFBR with 300 L column volume is shown in Figure 2. The AFBR has a 1.4 m available column height and 0.215 m^ cross-sectional area.

The Flow Distributor was a semi circular plate with diameter of 74 cm, 3.5 cm thickness and 0.215 m^ total area (Figure 3). The plate had 212 holes radially distributed with 986 holes/m^. It was able to support the static weight of the bed, avoid the return of particles and to distribute the liquid uniformly over the cross section of the fluidized bed column.

Inoculation and Operation of AFBR

The bioreactor was initially filled from the top of the column with granular activated carbon (GAC) 12 x 20 U.S. standard mesh (average 1.2 mm). The AFBR was then inoculated by pouring approximately 10 L of fresh biomass solids into the reactor column. The biomass was obtained from Rotating Biological Contactor from a previous ! experiment carried out in the Water and Wastewater Treatment Technologies Laboratory . ! (P e rr^ a n , 2003). The biomass had been exposed to low levels o f diesel fuel over many months. The AFBR was operated in batch mode for 65 days^.bipreactor for the acclimation o f biomass and was fed with fresh diesel synthetic wastewater every 2 days ; ! i  ' ; until a stable degradation was achieved. Biofilm formation started after the third week ! : and was fully developed after two months period. The bioreactor ran continuously from this time. The synthetic wastewater was pumped from the feed tank into the recycle line (as shown in Figure 4) of the anaerobic fluidized bed system using a model Vari Trac Î4 in-a-iA '? I HP variable speed pump. Effluent recycle .was applied with a model Vari Trac 1 ` A HP I pump to maintain a bed expansion oft 40%; -This level of-expansion-facilitated good mixing and prevented bed plugging. The feed flow rate was adjusted according to the Hydraulic Residence Time required in the AFBR column while maintaining a constant 80 L/min influent flow rate in the reactor.

The fluidizing velocity during the entire project was kept high enough so that all particles were in the fluidized state. An operation velocity of 0.0062 m/s = 0.62 cm/s was selected for feedwater based on minimum fluidization velocity and terminal velocity for GAC particles. Table 5 summarizes the operating conditions for the AFBR.

Recycle R atio. R, (ratio of volume of fluid returned to the reactor entrance to volume of fluid leaving the system) of 1537,1158, 761, 380,189 and 94 would be required for HRT of 96hr, 72hr, 48hr, 24hr, 12hr and 6 hr, respectively. For example, when HRT of 6 hours was required the upflow velocity was reduced to: (1.4m/6hour)=0.2333m/h=6.48148x10" m/s. The difference in flow between the required fluidizing velocity of 0.0062 m/s and the 6.48xl0'"m/s had to be made up by recycle (NYSERDA, 1987): (0 .0 0 6 2 m /5 -0.0000648148m/.s) R = ------------ ---------------------------- =94 0.0000648148m /j (211 ^ ''

G. Reactor Media
Several media types were compared in order to decide the type for use in this project.

FIGURE 6. MEDIA TYPES A) LAVA ROCK; B) GRANULAR ACTIVATED CARBON; C) CORK METAL; D) TRI-PACK;

.33

Low-density Tri Pack (12.7 mm diameter) was considered as an attachment medium in the fluidized bed reactor but was discarded due to its density being lower than that of water. Then Cork - Metal (35mm) media was tested for its low density (1.1 g/cm ) but was discarded because after less than a day in the AFBR the cork separated from the metal. The cork emerged to the top o f the bed and the metal sunk resting on the flow distributor. Granular Activated Carbon, 12x20 U.S. standard mesh size (1.2mm mean diameter) was very adequate because o f its low density arid rough surface, porosity and resistance to abrasion. In addition, the. adsorptive property of granular activated carbon increases the concentration o f soluble organic matter on the surface thus stimulating biofilm formation OEadron, 2004). Lava Rock was takeii into .consideration because of its low cost compared to the GAC. However i t ; ^ s discarded bècâuse it had a deiisity (1.79 g/cm^) higher than the density o f GAC (1.5g/cni^). _ i' . ; , . ;

The shear stress ÏT: dviie/cm^) oh the particle» was calculated to evaluate biofilm attachment to thé particles,(Ghang etal.:1991)r . ..Cl T -h l-E iH -, , j '. ` il (30)

It can be noted from Eqh. 30 that shear stress is dependent on the difference o f media density and feedvyater density. Therefore the lava rock has higher shear stress than the GAC particles. As a result it would be more difficult fo r`the attachment o f biofilm in Lava Rock particles than in GAC particles. The Anaerobic Fluidized Bed Reactor was charged with 12.5 kg of GAC media. This amount of media produced an initial unexpanded bed height of-*approximately 30 cm. Physical properties o f GAC are presentedjnTabled. z fK iS

3.2. Analytical Methods A. pH

In order to avoid any change in pH from the release of CO 2 , the pH of the feedwater was analyzed instantly following withdrawal of liquid sample. NaOH was added for pH adjustment. The pH was measured off-line using a Hanna instruments HI 9025 microcomputer pH meter. 35

B.

Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)

The COD was analyzed with the Closed Reflux, Colorimetric method as described in Standard Methods APHA 5220D (APHA, AWWA, and WPCF, 1995). The COD measurement is a very important test for assessing the APB Reactor performance. COD by definition is the equivalent amount of oxygen necessary to breakdown organic matter to CO2 and H 2 O under strong oxidizing agents (Maier et al, 2000). COD is measured by quantitative analysis of wastewater oxidation with potassium dichromate (K 2 Cr2 0 7 ) in the presence of sulfuric acid and silver and is expressed in milligram per liter. COD was determined using the COD high range digestion reagent filled vials (VWR International, Canada) and COD reactor (Bioscience, Canada). A feedwater sample (0.5 mL) was added carefully down the side of the vial so that it formed a layer on top of the reagents. The cap was closed and the contents of the sealed vial were thoroughly mixed by shaking. Then the twist-cap vial was placed in the preheated COD heater block and digested for 2 hours at 150 °C (Figure 7). Next, vials were removed from the heater block and allowed for cooling. A procedural blank was required to zero the absorbance reading prior to any sample measurement. The blank was prepared following the same procedure as above but instead of feedwater sample, 0.5 mL of distilled water was added. COD concentrations (mg/1) were directly read using the spectrophotometer Analyst Model 975MP microprocessor operated at 608 nm wavelength. The COD process is very fast to perform (2 hours) compared to BOD testing (5 days). A disadvantage of the COD method is associated with the fact that strong oxidants may breakdown more of the organic materials than a natural process would. Therefore, COD is only an approximation of the natural degradation of organic material in nature (Metcalf and Eddy, 2002).

C. White Light Microscopy

Microscopic observations were made on both elean partieles, and on partiele samples obtained from the fluidized bed reactor. The microscope, a Leica DML series, was equipped with a trinocular head (video camera + eye pieces), so that white light images could be obtained.

D. Liquid-Liquid Extraction

Liquid-Liquid Extraction is a process that allows the separation of two or more components due to their different solubilities in two immiscible liquid phases. LiquidLiquid extractions were performed with dichloromethane according to Standard Methods APHA 6410 (APHA, 1995) and EPA 3510 C (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2004). Briefly, this was an extraction by means of a separatory funnel. 100 mL of feedwater sample was poured in a separatory funnel and 35 mL of dichloromethane was slowly added. Then, the funnel was sealed with a stopper and it was shaken for 2 min with periodic venting for releasing the excess pressure. Next, the organic layer was let to rest for more than 10 minutes in order to separate from water. The bottom layer was collected in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask. Two more extractions were made following the same procedure using 35 mL and 30 mL dichloromethane. It was observed that residual water remained in the dichloromethane layer. The extracts were dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate granular, Na 2 S0 4 to remove any residual water from the dichloromethane layer. Next, 1 mL of the organic layer along with 20 pi Internal Standard were transferred in a GC autosampler vial for GC-MS analysis.

E.

Internal Standard

In order to improve the precision of quantitative GC-MS results, an internal standard was added to each sample. Internal standard application corrects any deviations from injection, flow rate and variations in GC-MS column conditions. In general, the internal standard used must have similar properties with the analyte and should elute near the analytical peaks. The precision obtained using an internal standard varies from 0.5 to 1.0 % (Skoog et al. 1997). The internal standard used in this experiment was SaAndrostane (Figure 9).

Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)

GC-MS analyses were carried out using Perkin Elmer Autosystem XL. Gas Chromatograph coupled with Turbomass Mass Spectrometer. GC-MS is a powerful instrument for determining the concentration of diesel fuel (Erickson, 2000; Zink and Lorber, 1995). Using these instruments together makes possible both the separation of

19

different compounds in complex mixtures and the identification of them on MS (Figure 10). The chromatography employed a MDN-5S Supelco column 35m x 0.25mm (I.D.) with a film thickness of 0.25 pm. The inlet temperature was maintained at 250 °C, while the column operating temperature was programmed as follows: The column was initially heated to 80 °C and maintained at this temperature for 1 min. It was subsequently increased to 300 °C at a rate of 25 °C/min, and maintained at 300°C for 7 min. The transfer line temperature was maintained at 275°C (Table 7)

H. Calibration Curve for GC-MS
Prior to collecting and testing wastewater samples from the Anaerobic Fluidized Bed Reactor, a calibration curve was prepared for diesel fuel concentration identified by the GC/MS. Dichloromethane (DCM) was determined to be the best solvent among many solvents applied (hexane, dichloromethane, methanol and acetone) as a mobile phase for diesel fuel hydrocarbons (Perryman, 2003). Samples for Calibration Curve of diesel fuel in DCM were prepared, ranging from 25 ppm to 400 ppm. Quantitative data were produced by GC-MS. Ratio of the integrated area under the curve for total diesel hydrocarbons to the integrated area of internal standard was the basis for determining the amount of diesel fuel in the unknown samples. The unknown extracted samples were not concentrated hence the ratio shows the true values for diesel fuel concentration. Dieselextracted standards were calculated by means of the experimentally determined extraction efficiency. The extraction efficiency was found to be an average of 50 %, which was consistent with the findings by Perryman (2003). The ratio (integrated area for total diesel hydrocarbons/ integrated area of internal standard) for the prepared standards and the calculated values for extracted standards values are shown in Table 8. The standard and extracted standard values for the above ratio versus diesel fuel concentration are plotted in Figure 11. The Gas chromatograms of diesel standards and diesel-extracted standards are presented in Appendix C, Figures C 1 to C 14 and C 15 to C 28, respectively.

I. Dissolved Oxygen Meter

Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in the water was measured using an YSI Model 58 Oxygen meter in combination with the YSI model 5739 dissolved oxygen probe. The YSI models have demonstrated to be reliable for measurement of oxygen concentration in water (Alvarez-Cuenca, 1979; Bolanos, 2000). Temperature was measured in the range 29°C - 31°C with 0.1 °C resolutions. Clark-type membranes were used during this study because they isolate the sensor elements from the environment but allowed oxygen and certain other gases to diffuse through them.

44

FIGURE 12. DISSOLVED OXYGEN MEASUREMENT EQUIPMENT

«

Dissolved Oxygen concentration was directly read in mg/L unit (Figure 12). In addition, a magnetic stirrer was used to mix the samples and to avoid oxygen depleted layers of the sample on the membrane surface, allowing greater accuracy in the measurements. The stirrer speed was maintained constant at setting 6 (-600 rpm) during all experimental measurements. Bolanos (2000) suggested that 600 rpm is an optimum speed with less than 2% variations. The DO meter calibration procedure utilized distilled water pre aerated for 30 minutes in order to achieve the equilibrium DO concentration in water at

4.5

the atmospheric pressure. Volume of liquid samples was IL and was kept constant throughout the study.

3.3. Typical Experimental Run
Figure 13 shows a schematic of the experimental facility where this investigation was conducted. A typical experimental run consisted of the following steps: 1. The water tank was filled with hot and cold tap water and then the water was mixed to reach the desired water temperature 30 + 1 °C. 2. The vacuum line of the vacuum stripper was opened to reduce the absolute pressure inside the column. The working absolute pressure was kept constant at 20 in. Hg.

3. The valve connecting the vacuum stripper with the water tank was switched on so that the vacuum created in vacuum stripper drew water from water tank into the vacuum stripper. In the vacuum stripper the water is de-oxygenated and collected in a reservoir at the bottom of the column. 4. The pump between the vacuum stripper and the feed tank was switched on. De oxygenated water from vacuum stripper was pumped to the feed tank 5. De-oxygenated water, diesel fuel, nutrients and buffers were added and mixed in the closed-tank (Section 3.I.B.). 6. The feedwater was pumped to the recycle line of fluidized bed reactor. The speed of the pump was controlled to set a desired liquid flowrate in the range between 75 U d and 120017d. 7. The water left the fluidized bed column through the weir that is located 145 cm from the diffuser and flows partly out and partly in the recycle line. In order to achieve the desired removal rates, flow recycling was employed. In these experiments the ratio of recycle flow to forward flow (recycle ratio) was controlled at 1537; 1158; 761; 380; 189 and 94. 8. Samples were taken at the sampling ports shown in Section 3.I.F. and analytical analyses were done according to Section 3.2.

3.4. Experimental Program
The main purpose of this research was to investigate the performance of the AFBR using GAC as attachment medium for microorganisms. The AFBR was operated in batch mode (for 65 days) to achieve acclimation of biomass and biofilm formation. After that, the GAC AFBR was operated continuously to observe the efficiency of biodégradation of diesel. The hydraulic residence time and the organic loading rate (OLR) were varied, while maintaining constant influent diesel fuel concentration in the reactor. The organic loading rate was a parameter used to illustrate the efficiency of fluidized bed reactors applied in wastewater treatment and accounts for both the influent flow rate and the influent substrate concentration. (Garcia-Calderon et al. 1998):

Steady state conditions were determined statistically when the coefficient of variance in the reactor's performance was less than 5 %, measured as effluent COD. The experimental program consisted of four phases, which are described in the following sections.

48

3.4.1 Phase I

During Phase I (day 1 to 36), the influent diesel fuel concentration in the AFB Reactor was 100 mg/L while organic loading rate and HRT varied. The organic loading rate increased with a decrease in HRT. Table 9 summarizes the operating conditions for the anaerobic reactor during Phase I of this study.

Phase II

During Phase H (day 37 to 69), the influent diesel concentration was constant at 200 mg/L while organic loading rate and HRT changed. The GAC-AFBR received an increase in organic loading rate while reducing the HRT as seen in Table 10. After the performance stabilized at each HRT, operation at the new HRT started. The reactor was considered to be at steady state condition when diesel was removed with no large fluctuations in effluent concentrations

CHAPTER 4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Several experiments were performed to study the anaerobic degradation of TPH (total petroleum hydrocarbons)-diesel fuel in the fluidized bed reactor for various diesel fuel influent concentrations under different operational conditions. Evaluation of gas chromatograms and COD results in the fbllpwihg sections will assess the reactor's diesel removal efficiency and COD removal capability. , .^

4.1.

Evaluations of Gas Chromatogram Results

The wastewater samples were taken at three sampling ports in the AFBR (see section 3.I.E.). The samples for each run were extracted using methods outlined in section 3.2.D. and prepared for GC/MS analysis. To deterrnihe the average value and to reduce experimental errors two samples were taken from each sampling point. The values of diesel fuel concentrations in (mg/L) for each experimental run taken by GC-MS have been shown in Appendix D, Table D 1 and Table D 2. Figure 14 shows that diesel fuel effluent concentration was as low as 23.11 mg/L for hydraulic residence time (HRT) of 96 hours. In addition for a HRT o f 6 hours diesel fuel effluent concentration was 43.08mg/L. Diesel fuel effluent concentrations increased gradually when the HRT decreased. Diesel removal efficiency in Phase I was 58.6 % for HRT o f 6 hours. Diesel removal efficiency increased up to 78.0 % when the HRT increased to 96 hours. The diesel fuel concentration in the effluent meets the Groundwater Standard (Level II) even at very short HRT of 6 hours. The low diesel fuel concentrations at the midpoint sampling port show that most of diesel fuel degradation had taken place in the zone between the distributor and the midpoint sampling port (located 45 cm above the distributor). This is

53

an indication that most o f the anaerobic degrading diesel fuel microorganisms attached to the GAC particles are located in this zone of AFBR.

During Phase IE (Figure 16) diesel fuel effluent concentration was 47.41 mg/L for HRT of 6 hours and decreased up to 23.95 mg/L during the increase in HRT to 96 hours. Figure 16 shows that diesel removal efficiency increased from 84.1 % at HRT of 6 hours

56

to 91.8 % at HRT o f 96 hours. It can be noted that effluent diesel fuel concentrations were maintained at less than 50 mg/L even for HRT as low as 6 hours. Gas chromatography results for Phase I, Phase U and Phase HI showed that the increase o f the HRT increased the diesel fuel removal efficiency. This pattern noticed (Figure 14-16) was due to a higher utilization o f diesel hydrocarbons by the anaerobic microorganisms at a higher residence time o f diesel hydrocarbons in contact with them. In addition, it was noticed that an increase in influent diesel fuel concentration was accompanied by an increase in the diesel fuel removal efficiency. This was due to fact that more dissolved diesel luel, concentration in wastewater was available to utilize by microorganisms. While diesel fuel influent concentration doubled and tripled from Phase I-IU, the diesel fuel effluent concentration increased slightly. For example, at HRT of 96 hours effluent concentration increased from 23.11 mg/L (Phase I), 23.31 mg/L (Phase II) to 23.95 mg/L (Phase ni). It can be seen from the data in Figures 14 to 16 that diesel fuel concentration gradients across the reactor existed during this study. This is significant since effluent diesel fuel concentrations from the anaerobic fluidized bed reactor were always < 50 mg/L while the diesel fuel influent concentrations in the reactor were 100, 200 and 300 mg/L. These results are important and show that AFBR was effective in achieving level II groundwater standards for HRT as low as 6 hours. Figure 17 shows that at the same HRT, the efficiency o f diesel fuel removal increased sharply from Phase I to Phase II, while reaching a constant level o f less than 4% variation for Phase II to Phase HI. This indicated that the maximum diesel fuel uptake rate is reached at Phase n (diesel fuel influent concentration 200 mg/L). For example, the efficiency o f diesel fuel removal in Phase I was 58.6 %, in Phase II was 80.86 % and in

57

Phase m was 84.1 % at HRT o f 6 hours. The diesel removal efficiency exceeded 58.6 % throughout the whole experiment (Figure 17).

It was noticed that diesel fuel concentration decreased much more in the first 45 cm from the flow distributor in the Phase 1 than in the Phase 11 (see Figure 14 and Figure 18). For example, in Phase 1, diesel fuel concentration for HRT o f 96 hr at the influent sampling port was 104.97 mg/L; 25.17 mg/L at the midpoint sampling port and 23.11 mg/L at the effluent sampling port. While for the same HRT in Phase IV the diesel fuel concentrations were; 102.98 mg/L at the influent port; 34.67 mg/L at the midpoint port; 22.82 mg/L at the effluent port. These results at the midpoint port might be due to the increase in the biofilm thickness during two months period, which causes an increase in the bed height.

The arising question of this study that whether the variations in reactor performance were due to the lowering of the HRT or due to acclimation of the biomass was answered by comparing results between Phase I and Phase IV (Figure 19). The diesel removal efficiency was 78.0 % in Phase I and 77.8 % in Phase IV for HRT of 96 hour. Also, for HRT of 6 hours, it was 58.6 % in Phase I and 61.9 % in Phase IV. A difference of less than 5 % in diesel removal efficiency was found between Phase I and Phase IV. This is a further indication of reproducibility of data collected in the treatment.

4.2.

Dissolved Oxygen Measurements

A series of dissolved oxygen (DO) tests were conducted in order to determine the dissolved oxygen concentration in the feedwater. Prior to each dissolved oxygen measurements the calibration procedure of the DO meter was completed (see Section 3.2.H.). The results of dissolved oxygen concentration in water before and after passing the Vacuum Stripper at 20 in. Hg vacuum are shown in Table 13. The dissolved oxygen at the outlet of vacuum stripper was in the range of 0.1-0.3 mg/L. These low levels of dissolved oxygen concentrations were necessary for creating the proper conditions for the anaerobic biodégradation. Figure 20 illustrates oxygen concentration profile along the flow for the first three experimental runs reported in Table 13. Wastewater samples were taken at the feed tank outlet, the influent of AFBR, the midpoint of AFBR and the outlet of AFBR. These wastewater samples were taken in order to verify that the dissolved oxygen concentration was low as required for anaerobic conditions.

In order to determine the average value and to reduce experimental errors two samples were taken from each sampling point. The values of COD concentrations (mg/L) for each experimental run can be found in Appendix B, Tables B 1 - B 4 for experimental runs for Phase I-IV. As Figure 22 indicates COD removal efficiency was greater than 74.7 % during Phase I for HRT as low as 6 hours, hence an increase in HRT was accompanied with an increase in COD removal capability.

The feedwater measured at the outlet sampling port contained less than 212 mg/L COD concentration during this investigation (Figure 21-23). Figure 24 shows the COD removal capability for Phase I, Phase II and Phase HI. The increase in HRT and/or the influent concentration were accompanied by an increase of COD removal efficiency. Figure 24 shows that the optimum COD removal efficiency is X . ' reached in Phase II. These results are in accordance with the results from gas \ chromatogram evaluations (Section 4.1).

Figure 25 shows that COD removal percentage was greater than 69.9 % during Phase IV (Phase IV is a repetition o f Phase I after 2 months) for a HRT as low as 6 hours. From comparing the diesel fuel removal efficiency o f Phase I and Phase IV, it was noticed less

68

than 5 % deviation (Figure 19). The same cannot be said for the COD removal capability of Phase I and Phase IV (Figure 26). The explanation for these results is related to the fact that certain aromatic hydrocarbons are resistant to the oxidizing conditions of the COD test (Metcalf and Eddy, 2002). It can be suggested that the existence of more aromatic hydrocarbons in the feedwater o f Phase I is the major factor causing higher variation in COD removal capability of Phase I and Phase IV (Figure 19 and Figure 26).

Figure 27 shows that COD removal efficiency depended on COD loading rate and HRT. Low COD loading rate and high HRT resulted in high COD removal efficiency. The COD removal efficiency decreases while increasing the COD loading rate (Figure 27). However, the COD removal efficiency seems to level off, when the COD loading rates

69

exceeds 0.5 Kg /m^day. More than 69.9 % o f influent COD was removed, which indicates that the Anaerobic Fluidized Bed system was highly effective.

4.4. Adsorption of Diesel Fuel on Granular Activated Carbon (GAG) 4.4.1. Introduction

The specific capacity of a GAC to adsorb organic compounds is related to: molecular surface attraction, total surface area available per unit weight of carbon, and concentration of contaminants in the wastewater (CARBTROL Corporation, 2004).

There is great variation in the adsorbability of dissolved/suspended substances, and also great variability in the adsorptive capacity of different activated carbons. The standard procedure for evaluating diesel fuel adsorption in GAC is by means of the adsorption isotherm. The adsorption isotherm represents an empirical relationship between the amount of contaminant adsorbed per unit weight of activated carbon and its equilibrium water concentration. Freundlich model is one of the most widely used isotherms for the description of adsorption equilibrium (Freundlich, 1906): = K ct' where: x/m = Amount of diesel fuel adsorbed per unit weight of GAC Ce = Concentration of diesel remaining in solution after adsorption is complete (at equilibrium) (mg/L) K = Empirical constant that is taken as an indicator of adsorption capacity 1/n = Empirical constant related to the magnitude of the adsorption driving force The constants K and 1/n can be determined by plotting the logarithmic form of Freundlich equation: log(x / m) = log .S T+ (1/ n) log (32)

The slope of the line developed is equal to 1/n and the intercept equal to K. A Freundlich adsorption isotherm was determined by preparing several identical bottles of activated

71

carbon suspended in water. Varying amounts of a diesel fuel were added to the bottles, and all were mixed until adsorption had reached equilibrium under conditions of constant temperature and pressure. Then the carbon was filtered out and the solutions were analyzed to find how much diesel fuel remained unadsorbed in each bottle. The x/m is calculated using the Equation 32 and the two Freundlich constants. The capacity in mg/g of carbon on the Y-axis that corresponds to the value of 1.0 mg/L on the X-axis is the one value used by international agreement (Fox, 1989). If the isotherm does not cross the 1.0mg/L point, the line is artificially extrapolated to that level for the purpose.

4.4.2.

Experimental Procedure

To determine the removal of diesel fuel due to adsorption, GAC adsorption isotherm experiments were conducted using the bottle point method (Miller et al. 1998). The experiments were performed under anaerobic conditions at 30°C and in absence of microorganisms. Anaerobic conditions were obtained by puging nitrogen in the headspace of bottles. (Fox, 1989). During this experiment 8 clean dry 250 conical flasks fitted with stoppers were used. First 10 g (weighted accurately + 0.00 Ig) of granular activated carbon were added to each flask. Then, eight different concentrations of diesel fuel solutions (300 mg/L, 200 mg/L, 100 mg/L, lOmg/L, 8 mg/L, 6mg/L, 4mg/L and 2 mg/L) were prepared in 500 ml flasks. To each 250 ml flask, 100 ml aliquot of one of the eight-diesel fuel solutions was added. The flasks were tumbled for 24 hours to assist the equilibration process. Finally, the eight solutions were filtered collecting the filtrate in clean, dry flasks. The filtrate was extracted with dichloromethane (1:1) and then the dichloromethane layer was passed through a glass wool filter filled with anhydrous granular Na 2 S 0 4 . Duplicate samples of each were run in the GC-MS. From the GC-MS

72

data we determined the concentration of the diesel fuel solutions at equilibrium. Results from the anaerobic isotherm tests are presented in Table 14.

The Freundlich adsorption isotherm was plotted from the experimental data shown on the Table 15. The adsorption isotherm coefficients were determined by plotting x/m versus Ce on log-log paper, the intercept when Ce = 1.0 was the value of (x/m) and the slope of the line was equal to 1/n. (Figure 28). Thus, K = 0.002 and slope l/n=0.1695.

Eqiilibrium Concentration (m g^

The adsorption capacity of GAC for diesel fuel at 30°C temperature is less than 0.004 mg diesel fuel/g GAC (Figure 29). Based on the adsorption capacity and the total amount of GAC present in the AFBR (12500 g) the removal of diesel fuel due to GAC adsorption can be considered negligible (-0.3 %) compared to the total diesel removal (i.e. 60.92 mg/L for Phase I at HRT of 6 hours, Figure 14) The chromatograms of Anaerobic Adsorption Isotherm Test are located in Appendix E, Figures E 1 to E 16.

4.5. Biofilm Thickness
Biofilm was attached on the GAC particles after the first 65 days o f the reactor operation in batch mode. The period between the first contact o f the microorganism with diesel fuel hydrocarbons and the time point when a reduction in diesel fuel concentration can be observed is called acclimation phase. This acclimation period is not long considering that anaerobic microorganisms need usually 3-6 months. For industrial application it is imperative to reduce the acclimation period. It can be suggested that microbial inoculation (with biomass taken from a Rotating Biological Contactor treating diesel contaminated water) reduced the acclimation period. The AFBR was operated in batch with fresh diesel fuel influent every two days. The effect o f diesel fuel feeding pattern in the acclimation period was not investigated. A uniform biofilm layer followed biofilm formation on the crevices o f the GAC rough surface, as seen in Figure 25. The biofilm thickness (pm) was measured from white light obtained by using an x 20 objective. At the top o f the AFBR it was noticed that smaller particle's diameter was associated with thicker biofilm layer (120 pm). At the bottom o f the reactor particles had a smaller

biofilm thickness growing on a higher diameter support. From the calculations in Appendix A it can be noted that the particle density for a 841 pm diameter GAC decreased from 1500 kg/m^ to 1288 kg/m^ (with biofilm thickness of 120 pm). Calculations in Appendix A showed that the terminal velocity decreased from 3.8 cm/s for clean particles to 3.4 cm/s for biocovered particles when the biofilm thickness was 120 pm. The biofilm covered particles moved up higher in the AFBR bed as a result of the decrease in the bioparticle density. The biofilm growth during the reactor operation increased the particles diameter, but decreased the particles density.

CHAPTER 5. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 5.1. Conclusions

The following conclusion can be drawn from this investigation:

·

Diesel fuel contaminated water was successfully treated anaerobically in a GACAFB bioreactor. The contributions of both biological degradation and adsorption on the GAC were investigated. It was concluded that biological degradation is by far the principal process in the degradation of diesel fuel. Indeed, GAC particles were mostly inert.

·

Diesel removal efficiency was 58.6 % for influent concentration of 100 mg/L, 80.9 % for influent concentration of 200 mg/L and 84.1 % for influent concentration of 300 mg/L at HRT of 6 hours and flowrate 1200 L/d. An optimum concentration between 200 mg/L and 300 mg/L was observed for the fluidized bed bioreactor used.

·

The increase of the HRT and/or influent diesel concentration was accompanied by an increase in the removal efficiency.

·

COD reduction greater than 69.9 % was achieved during the continuous operation of the AFBR at a flowrate of 1200 L/d and COD influent concentration of 1599 mg/L.

·

Diesel fuel concentration in the treated wastewater was less than 50 mg/L at HRT of 6 hours and flowrate 1200 L/d that satisfies the requirement for (level 11) Moderate Sensitivity Sites.

79

5.2. RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the experience of this research project, and the results obtained, the following studies are suggested:

· The treatment of the diesel fuel contaminated groundwater using various media types (sand, fired clay, porous glass beads, plastic beads with densities slightly greater than water, sepiolite, pumice, kaolinite) for biofilm formation.

· The optimum conditions to reduce the acclimation period of the biomass in the Fluidized Bed Reactor (the effect of diesel fuel feeding pattern and microbial inoculation in the acclimation period) need to be researched.

·

The study of other complex mixtures of persistent organic compounds in the AFB reactor. Real wastewaters are complex mixtures in which many components are unknown.

APPENDIX A-Sample Calculations · Organic Loading Rate (OLR)
The OLR is the average rate at which diesel fuel is introduced into a unit volume of the reactor and is normally reported as kg COD added per m^ reactor per day. The OLR accounts for both the influent flow rate and the influent substrate concentration according to Garcia-Calderon et al (1998): OLR, kg COD/mVd ={ [Si (kg COD/m^) x Qi (mVd)] / V (m^)} Where: V = 300L = 0.3m^ F or Phase I at H RT 96 h r Where: Si = 615mg/l=615g/m^*(lkg/1000g) = 0.615 kg COD/m^

Qi =0.052 LPM*(m^/1000L)*(60Min/Hr)*(24 Hr/d)=0.075m^/d
OLR =(Si X Qi)/V=0.046125kg COD/d /0.3 m^=0.154 (kg COD/m^/d) F or Phase II a t H RT 96 h r

Si =0.895 k g COD/m^ Qi =0.075 m^/d
