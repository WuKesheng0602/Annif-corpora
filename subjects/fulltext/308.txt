Introduction

Global trade liberalization occurs through a variety of channels, not all of which appear to be in harmony with one another. While practically every major nation is now a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and a participant in its complex process of multilateral trade liberalization, an average WTO member also belongs to six preferential trade agreements (PTAs) (World Bank, 2005). The schizophrenic nature of today' s multilateral trading system is re ected in the somewhat con icting rules of the WTO' s key multilateral trade agreement, i.e. the General Agreement for Tari¤s and Trade (GATT): while Article I of GATT requires member countries to undertake trade liberalization on a most-favored-nation (MFN) or non-discriminatory basis, Article XXIV of the very same agreement permits WTO member countries to pursue PTAs under which participating countries grant tari¤ (and other trade policy) concessions to each other that they do not have to extend to all member countries of the WTO.1 This raises the following question: would GATT serve the cause of global free trade more e¤ectively if it did not include the exception to MFN provided by Article XXIV? In other words, would global free trade be easier to achieve if all WTO members were to pursue trade liberalization on only a multilateral basis? To address this issue, we develop an equilibrium theory of trade agreements and use it to compare the pros and cons of bilateral and multilateral approaches to trade liberalization. We analyze the coalition proof (or stable) Nash equilibria of a game of trade liberalization between three countries that di¤er with respect to their endowment levels. The game (which we refer to as bilateralism ) proceeds as follows. In the ...rst stage, each country announces the names of its trading partner(s) with whom it wishes to sign a free trade agreement (FTA). An FTA between two countries requires them to abolish tari¤s on each other and it arises i¤ they both announce each other' s name. Next, given the world trade regime, countries choose their tari¤s. Finally, international trade and consumption take place. After analyzing equilibrium trade agreements under bilateralism, we examine the stable equilibria of this game under the
While Article XXIV tries to limit the damage on non-member countries by requiring PTA members to not raise tari¤s on outsiders, the fact remains that it contradicts the principle of non-discrimination that underlies the entire WTO system.

restriction that countries can liberalize trade on only a multilateral basis (we call this game multilateralism ). By comparing equilibrium outcomes under bilateralism with those under multilateralism, we isolate the consequences of the exception to multilateral trade liberalization available to WTO members under GATT Article XXIV.2 To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the ...rst to provide such a comparison in a model in which both the nature and the degree of trade liberalization are endogenously determined. Consistent with actual WTO experience, under our multilateralism game a pair of countries can engage in mutual trade liberalization so long as each of them extends their respective tari¤ reductions also to the third country ­ as mandated by the GATT' s MFN clause.3 We ...nd that the degree of trade liberalization undertaken by two countries (say i and j ) under such a multilateral trade agreement hfij m gi is lower relative to that under the bilateral free trade agreement hfij gi. As a result, the non-participating country (i.e. k ) actually faces lower tari¤s in export markets under the bilateral FTA hfij gi relative to the multilateral trade agreement hfij m gi. However, the non-member country faces discriminatory tari¤s in export markets under hfij gi whereas no such discrimination exists under hfij m gi. Due to this crucial di¤erence between the two types of trade agreements, in our model the non-member country is worse o¤ under the bilateral FTA hfij gi relative to the multilateral agreement hfij m gi. Equilibrium analysis reveals that when countries are symmetric with respect to their endowment levels, global free trade is the only stable equilibrium under both bilateralism and multilateralism. In other words, under symmetry, the freedom to pursue purely bilateral agreements has no consequences at all insofar as the obtainment of global free trade is concerned. This immediately raises the question whether this irrelevance result holds when the underlying economic environment is asymmetric in some respects. To this end, we then analyze a scenario where endowment levels are unequal across countries and ...nd that global free trade is stable over a larger parameter space under bilateralism relative to multilateralism. This result has a powerful and surprising implication: there exist circumstances where global free trade is a
We do not consider unilateral trade liberalization since the presence of terms of trade considerations in our model implies that such liberalization is not in any country' s interest. 3 Note that in our model countries are free to sign a multilateral agreement even under bilateralism. By contrast, the multilateralism game rules out a discriminatory bilateral FTA.

stable equilibrium only if countries are free to form bilateral FTAs. Why? The logic is as follows. While considering whether or not to participate in multilateral trade liberalization, each country has to take into account its welfare under the trade regime that emerges in the absence of its participation. Since a non-participating country (say k ) is worse o¤ under the bilateral FTA hfij gi relative to the multilateral agreement hfij m gi, each country' s incentive to participate in multilateral trade liberalization is stronger when its non-participation results in a discriminatory bilateral FTA between the other two countries as opposed to when it results in a non-discriminatory multilateral agreement between them.4 In this way, the freedom to pursue bilateral agreements can act as a force in favor of multilateral trade liberalization.5 Our results show that heterogeneity across countries may be an important determinant of the potential for success of multilateralism and that bilateralism has a useful role to play in the process of global trade liberalization. An important implication of our analysis is that to properly account for the role of bilateralism, we need to better understand why countries choose to enter into bilateral agreements when multilateral trade liberalization is an option. In this context it is noteworthy that while both Krugman (1991) and Grossman and Helpman (1995) noted that asymmetries across countries can play a crucial role in determining incentives for bilateral and multilateral trade liberalization, existing literature has tended to pay little attention to this issue. Indeed, in our model bilateral FTAs even fail to arise when countries have symmetric endowments since, under such circumstances, countries ...nd it in their mutual interest to go all the way to global free trade. In a recent paper, Aghion et. al. (2007) examine a leading country' s choice between sequential and multilateral bargaining of free trade agreements and provide a comparison of these bargaining processes. While we consider similar issues, there are important di¤erences
4 Since political economy considerations can potentially play an important role in determining incentives for bilateral and multilateral trade liberalization, later in the paper (section 6) we consider a scenario where governments put greater weight on producer interests relative to consumer surplus and tari¤ revenue. We ...nd that the presence of such political economy motives actually enlarges the parameter space over which the freedom to pursue bilateral trade agreements is necessary for achieving global free trade. 5 Saggi and Yildiz (2006) consider cost di¤erences across countries in an oligopolistic model of intraindustry trade and uncover similar results. See Levy (1997), Krishna (1998), and Ornelas (2005b) for analyses focusing on political economy considerations.

between their approach and ours. First, in our model, all countries are free to negotiate FTAs and countries can form multiple bilateral FTAs. Second, under multilateralism, Aghion et al. (2007) assume that countries have only a binary choice between global free trade and no agreement whereas we permit two countries to undertake trade liberalization on an MFN basis. In Aghion et al. (2007), when bilateral FTAs are forbidden (i.e. under their multilateral bargaining protocol), any single country (say country k ) can ensure that no agreement hf gi prevails by simply opting to not practise free trade itself while such a country ends up facing the multilateral agreement hfij m gi in our model. As a result, while the nature of coalition externalities (i.e. whether they are negative or positive) shapes the choice between sequential and multilateral bargaining and the circumstances under which global free trade obtains in their model, the relative degree of the positive externality under the bilateral FTA hfij gi and the multilateral agreement hfij m gi is the driving force behind our analysis. More speci...cally, while both hfij gi and hfij m gi generate a positive externality for the non-member by increasing its welfare relative to the status quo, the degree of the positive externality is stronger under the multilateral agreement hfij m gi. Finally, unlike Aghion et. al. (2007), we do not allow transfers between di¤erent coalitions. This is important because when transfers are possible and global free trade maximizes aggregate welfare, it necessarily emerges as the equilibrium under both sequential and multilateral bargaining. When free trade does not maximize aggregate welfare, Aghion et. al. (2007) ...nd that FTAs facilitate the achievement of global free trade i¤ they create negative externalities for non-members. In our model, FTAs can have this e¤ect even when free trade maximizes global welfare and FTAs generate a positive externality for the non-member. Our paper shares some key elements with Goyal and Joshi (2006) and Furusawa and Konishi (2007), both of which employ the network formation game developed by Jackson and Wolinsky (1996) in examining whether or not a given trade con...guration is pair-wise stable.6 Under symmetry, global free trade is also stable under their approach. Unlike, us however,
Relative to our approach, the concept of pairwise stability implies two constraints. First, the deviating coalition can contain at most two countries. Second, the deviation can consist of severing just one existing link or forming one additional link. In order to eliminate these constraints, we follow Bernheim et al. (1987) and use the concept of coalition proof Nash equilibrium to isolate stable equilibria.

they only examine whether the formation of bilateral FTAs results in global free trade as the stable outcome and do not analyze the consequences of adopting a strictly multilateral approach to trade liberalization. The approach of this paper is also related to that of Riezman (1999) who also asks whether bilateralism facilitates or hinders the achievement of global free trade. However, while we analytically derive the stable Nash equilibria of a non-cooperative game of FTA formation, Riezman (1999) uses the cooperative solution concept of the core and illustrates his results via numerical examples. Second, our model allows us to focus on asymmetries across countries in a way that cannot be done in Riezman' s (1999) framework. The relationship between preferential and multilateral liberalization has frequently been analyzed in the literature in models of repeated interaction between countries ­see Bagwell and Staiger (1997), Bond et. al. (2001), Freund (2000), and Saggi (2006).7 We add value to this literature by treating both bilateral and multilateral liberalization as endogenous.8

Underlying trade model

To endogenize the formation of trade agreements among asymmetric countries, we utilize an appropriately adapted version of the partial equilibrium framework developed by Bagwell and Staiger (1999). There are three countries: a; b; and c and three (non-numeraire) goods: A, B , and C . Each country' s market is served by two competing exporters and I denotes the good that corresponds to the upper case value of i. For example, if i = a then I = A. Country i is endowed with zero units of good I and ei units of the other two goods where ea The demand for good z in country i is given by d(pz i) = eb ec .9

pz i where z = A; B; or C .

As is well known, the above demand functions can be derived from a utility function of the form U (cz ) = u(cz ) + w where cz denotes consumption of good z ; w denotes the numeraire good; and u(cz ) is quadratic and additively separable in each of the three goods. Since each
See Bhagwati et. al. (1999) for a collection of many of the important papers in the area. Note that while the joint welfare of members is often considered in determining whether or not a trade agreement would arise (see, for example, Ornelas (2005a) and Krishna (1998)), much of the existing literature on free trade agreements does not derive the equilibria of a game that fully speci...es the process by which such agreements arise. 9 In addition, all countries have large enough endowments of the numeraire good w to ensure trade balance.

country possesses only two goods while it demands all three, country i must import good I in order to consume it and it can import it from either trading partner. For example, country a imports good A from both countries b and c while it exports good B to country b and good C to country c. Let tij be the tari¤ imposed by country i on its imports of good I from country j . Ruling out prohibitive tari¤s yields the following no-arbitrage conditions for good I :
I I pI i = pj + tij = pk + tik

s imports of good I . Since country i where i; j; k = a; b; c; and i 6= j 6= k . Let mI i be country i' has no endowment of good I , we have
I mI i = d(pi ) =

pI i

(2)

Each country' s exports of a good must equal its endowment of that good minus its local consumption: xI j = ej [ pI j] (3)

Market clearing for good I requires that country i' s imports equal the total exports of the other two countries: mI i = X
j 6=i

(5)

Using these prices, the volume of trade is easily calculated. As is clear from equation (5), the price of good I in country i increases in its tari¤s and decreases in the endowment levels of the other two countries. The e¤ect of a country' s tari¤ on its terms of trade is evident from equation (5): only a third of a given increase in either of its tari¤s is passed on to domestic 6

consumers with exactly two third of the increase falling on the shoulders of foreign exporters. By design the model examines country i' s trade protection towards only good I (i.e. the only non-numeraire good that it imports). Since countries have asymmetric endowments, under free trade country a faces the largest volume of imports of protected goods (it imports (eb + ec )=3 units of good A) whereas country c faces the lowest volume of imports of such goods (it imports (ea + eb )=3 units of good C ).10 Note also that country i' s imports of good I do not equal its exports of other non-numeraire goods. For example, under free trade, country a exports (2ea eb )=3 units of good C to country c and (2ea ec )=3 units of good B to country b

and the sum of these exports is lower than its total imports of good C : 0 < 4ea eb ec < eb + ec . In order to balance trade, in addition to exporting goods B and C , country a exports the numeraire good to both countries b and c. Similarly, country c imports the numeraire good from both its trading partners. From a welfare perspective, given the partial equilibrium nature of the model, it su¢ ces to consider only protected goods. A country' s welfare is de...ned as the sum of consumer surplus, producer surplus, and tari¤ revenue over all such goods: X

(6)

Using equations (1) through (5) one can easily obtain welfare of country i as a function of endowment levels and tari¤s. Let aggregate world welfare be de...ned as the sum of each P country' s welfare: ww = i wi . We proceed as follows. First, we consider a three stage game of trade liberalization under which each country is free to pursue either (a) no trade liberalization or (b) bilateral trade liberalization or (c) multilateral trade liberalization.11 This game is meant to capture the various options regarding trade liberalization available to WTO members, option (b) being made possible by GATT Article XXIV. After deriving Nash equilibria and isolating those equilibria
The same ranking applies with respect to the value of imports so long as 3 > ea + eb + 2ec , which is a minor condition that is assumed to hold. 11 Since all countries have market power in our model, allowing for unilateral liberalization is not necessary: no country will choose to pursue such liberalization in our model.

that are stable (more on this below), we ask how equilibrium outcomes are a¤ected if countries cannot pursue bilateral trade liberalization and must instead choose between multilateral trade liberalization or no liberalization at all. This exercise allows to isolate the consequences of the exception to MFN provided under GATT Article XXIV.

Endogenous trade agreements

We now describe our game of trade liberalization (which we refer to as bilateralism ). In the ...rst stage, each country simultaneously announces whether or not it wants to sign a free trade agreement (FTA) with each of its trading partners. Country i' s announcement is denoted by its strategy set
i i

and

consists of four possible announcements:

i

= ff ; g; fj; g; f ; k g; fj; k gg,

where f ; g denotes an announcement in favor of the status quo or no trade liberalization; fj; g in favor of an FTA with only country j ; f ; k g in favor of an FTA with only country k ; and fj; k g in favor of FTAs with both of them (which is equivalent to announcing in favor of multilateral free trade). This stage determines the underlying trade policy regime. Next, given the policy regime, countries impose their optimal tari¤s. Finally, given trade agreements and tari¤s, international trade and consumption take place. The following trade policy regimes can emerge in the bilateralism game: (i ) No agreement or the status quo hf gi prevails when no two announcements match or the only matching announcements are f ; g; (ii ) an FTA between countries i and j denoted by hfij gi is formed i¤ countries i and j announce each other' s name j

(iii ) two independent FTAs in

and (iv ) free trade, denoted by hfF gi, obtains i¤ all countries announce each

others'names: i.e.

= fj; k g for all i; j; k = a; b; c.12

Before proceeding further, we clarify two expositional points. First, the regime hfij; ik gi is a ` hub and spoke'trading arrangement where the ` hub'country (i.e. i) has an independent FTA with each of the two ` spoke' countries who do not have an FTA with each other. To
In order to eliminate redundant announcements, we assume that each announcement costs " (where " > 0 is arbitrarily small).

simplify notation, we denote hfij; ik gi as hfihgi (i.e. country i is hub). Second, while changes in the underlying trade regime result from announcement deviations by countries, it proves convenient to refer directly to regime changes rather than changes in announcements. For example, when the bilateral FTA hfij gi is in place, the unilateral announcement deviation of country i from fj; g to f ; g alters the underlying trade regime from hfij gi to no agreement hf gi and we refer to this announcement deviation of country i as simply a deviation from hfij gi to hf gi. Throughout the remainder of this section as well as section 4, we maintain the following assumption:13 Assumption 1: ei = e for all i = a; b; c: (symmetry)

Let country i' s welfare as a function of trade regime r be denoted by wi (r) where r fhf gi ; hfij gi ; hfjk gi ; hfihgi ; hfjhgi or hfF gig and i; j; k = a; b; c. Also, let denote the di¤erence between country i' s welfare under trade regimes r and v : wi (r) wi (v ). wi (r wi (r v) v)

Since Article I of GATT forbids tari¤ discrimination, we assume that under the status quo, each country imposes a non-discriminatory tari¤ on its trading partners: tij = tik = ti for all i; j; k = a; b; c. Country i' s optimal MFN tari¤ is easily calculated: e 4

ti

Arg max wi ( ) =

(7)

If two countries form an FTA, they remove their tari¤s on each other and impose their optimal external tari¤s on the non-member country: under hfij gi we have tij = tji = 0, tik = tf i and tjk = tf j . The optimal external tari¤ of country i on the non-member country k is given by: tf i

Arg max wi (ij ) =

e 11

Calculations supporting the results reported in this section as well as the rest of the paper are contained in the appendix.

f f Note that under symmetry, we have ti = tj = t and tf i = tj = t . As in Bagwell and Staiger

(1997, 1999), we ...nd that the formation of a bilateral FTA induces each member to lower its tari¤ on the non-member country relative to the status quo (i.e. the model exhibits tari¤ complementarity): tf < t .14 Before deriving equilibrium agreements, we report a useful lemma that is easy to establish: Lemma 1: Under symmetry, wj (ih F) < 0 < wi (ih F ).

In other words, the hub country (i) of the hub and spoke agreement hfihgi is better o¤ relative to free trade hfF gi while each spoke country is worse o¤. Note that the hub country i enjoys privileged access in both spoke countries under hfihgi since neither spoke imposes a tari¤ on the hub whereas both impose the tari¤ tf on each other. As a result of this favorable treatment, country i is strictly better o¤ under hfihgi relative to hfF gi. To see why the spokes are worse o¤ under hfihgi relative to hfF gi, ...rst note that aggregate global welfare is strictly higher under hfF gi relative to hfihgi. Since the hub is strictly better o¤ under hfihgi relative to hfF gi and welfare of the two spoke countries is equal due to symmetry, both spokes must be worse o¤ under hfihgi relative to hfF gi. In fact, each spoke country has an incentive to revoke its FTA with the hub and become an outsider facing an FTA between the other two countries: wj (ik ih) > 0.

We are now ready to derive equilibrium trade agreements under bilateralism. To economize space, we provide a rather condensed discussion of Nash equilibria. It is straightforward to show that given Assumption 1, the status quo hf gi, a bilateral FTA hfij gi, and free trade hfF gi are all Nash equilibria under bilateralism. The hub and spoke regime fails to be an equilibrium because wj (ik ih) > 0. A bilateral FTA hfij gi is a Nash equilibrium because wi (ij )= wj (ij )>0 (9)

14 See Bagwell and Staiger (1997, 1999) and Saggi and Yildiz (2009) for a detailed discussion of the tari¤ complementarity e¤ect and Estevadeordal et. al. (2008) for empirical evidence in its support. It is worth noting that tari¤ complementarity also arises in simple general equilibrium models of trade agreements such as Bond et. al. (2004).

10

i.e. a member country of a bilateral FTA has no unilateral incentive to break the agreement.15 Global free trade hfF gi is a Nash equilibrium because Lemma 1 implies that no country will deviate to become a spoke and the deviation to become a non-member facing an FTA is ruled out because wi (F jk ) > 0 (10)

To deal with the multiplicity problem and to capture the process of FTA formation in a more realistic fashion, we now isolate Nash equilibria that are coalition proof or stable (as in Dutta and Mutuswami, 1997).16 We begin by considering the potential stability of free trade hfF gi. Given Lemma 1, we need to consider only two joint deviations from free trade: (JF1): Deviation of i and j from hfF gi to hfij gi. (JF2): Deviation of i and j from hfF gi to hf gi. Deviation JF1 can be ruled out because, under symmetry, no two countries have a joint incentive to exclude the third country from free trade:

wi (F

ij ) > 0

(11)

Finally, it is immediate from (9) and (11) that the three countries have no incentive to deviate jointly from hfF gi to hf gi so that JF2 is ruled out. In fact, this inequality also implies that hf gi is not a stable Nash equilibrium since the joint deviation of countries i and j from hf gi to hfij gi is self-enforcing: both countries bene...t from this joint deviation and it is immune to further unilateral deviations by virtue of the fact that hfij gi is a Nash equilibrium. By similar logic, it is easy to see that hfij gi also fails to be stable since the joint deviation of all three countries to hfF gi is self-enforcing. Thus, we have shown the following: Proposition 1: Given symmetry, free trade hfF gi is the only stable trade agreement under
Due to the tari¤ complementarity e¤ect, the formation of an FTA generates a positive externality for the non-member: wk (ij ) > 0. 16 Following Bernheim et. al. (1987), a coalitional deviation is self-enforcing if a proper subset of players in the deviating coalition have no incentive to undertake a further deviation. Note that an alternative approach would have been to use the notion of a strong Nash equilibrium (SNE). However, the use of CPNE is more appealing since a SNE must be immune to any joint deviations, even those that are not self-enforcing.

bilateralism. It is worth noting that the above result also obtains under the network formation game of Goyal and Joshi (2006) under which countries pursue only bilateral trade agreements. Interestingly, Goyal and Joshi (2006) interpret this result as establishing the compatibility of bilateralism and free trade. As we shall see below, by providing a comparison of bilateralism and multilateralism our model suggests an alternative interpretation of this result. We now analyze a scenario where any trade liberalization undertaken by countries must be multilateral or non-discriminatory in nature. This analysis helps assess how the prospects of attaining global free trade are a¤ected if countries cannot form bilateral FTAs that, by their very nature, discriminate against the non-member country.

Endogenous agreements under multilateralism

Under a multilateral approach to trade liberalization (or simply multilateralism ), the strategy set of country i is
i

= f ; M g, j 6= k 6= i. In other words, each country announces either in

favor of or against multilateral trade liberalization. If all three countries announce in favor, they choose the jointly optimal set of tari¤s which, in our model, are equal to zero. Thus, a multilateral agreement in which all countries participate necessarily leads to global free trade. If only two countries (say i and j ) announce in favor of multilateralism, they jointly choose their optimal tari¤s subject to the constraint that they must not discriminate against country k ­i.e. in accordance with the MFN clause of the WTO, any tari¤ cut undertaken by either country i or j must apply to imports from both its trading partners. Formally, countries i and j sign the multilateral agreement hfij m gi when individual country announcements are as follows:
i

= M,

j

= M,

k

= . Finally, note that if two (or more) countries announce

against multilateralism, the status quo hf gi prevails under which each country imposes its individually optimal MFN tari¤ on every other country. If countries i and j agree to sign the multilateral agreement hfij m gi they choose the tari¤

12

m pair (tm i , tj ) to solve m (tm i ; tj )

Arg max [wi (ij m ) + wj (ij m )]

(12)

m m m Under symmetry, tm i = tj = t and this jointly optimal MFN tari¤ t is given by:

tm =

e e where tm < t = 7 4

(13)

Since tm < t , it is immediate that under the multilateral agreement hfij m gi countries i and j lower their tari¤s on each other as well as on the non-participating country (i.e. k ). This result implies that under hfij m gi country k bene...ts from the multilateral trade liberalization undertaken by the other two countries without having to o¤er any liberalization in return since it retains its individually optimal MFN tari¤ t on countries i and j . Furthermore, it is worth emphasizing that country k faces lower tari¤s in export markets when the other two countries implement the bilateral FTA hfij gi relative to when they sign the multilateral agreement hfij m gi, i.e., tf < tm . In other words, the degree of trade liberalization undertaken by two countries is lower when they sign the multilateral agreement hfij m gi than when they sign the bilateral agreement hfij gi: t tm < t tf . Despite this, the welfare of the non-member country (k ) is higher under hfij m gi compared to hfij gi: wk (ij ) < wk (ij m ). This is because the non-member is subject to discriminatory treatment in each member' s market under the bilateral FTA hfij gi: while countries i and j face zero tari¤s in each other' s market under hfij gi, country k faces the tari¤ tf . By contrast, such discriminatory treatment is absent under hfij m gi since trade liberalization undertaken by countries i and j is extended to country k on an MFN basis. As we will show below, this fundamental di¤erence between bilateral and multilateral trade liberalization plays a crucial role in our analysis. As under bilateralism, it is straightforward that the status quo hf gi is also a Nash equilibrium under multilateralism. Furthermore, hfij m gi is not a Nash equilibrium because the outside country (k ) actually bene...ts from joining the agreement hfij m gi thereby converting it to hfF gi: wk (F ij m ) > 0 13 (14)

The above inequality also implies that no country has a unilateral incentive to deviate from free trade. Thus, under symmetry, free trade hfF gi is also a Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, since all three countries bene...t from a joint deviation from the status quo to free trade (from which there are no further coalitional deviations), we have: Proposition 2: Given symmetry, free trade hfF gi is the only stable agreement under multilateralism.17 A comparison of Propositions 1 and 2 shows that when countries are symmetric, multilateralism is su¢ cient to reach global free trade. One interpretation of this result is that if the move from the status quo to global free trade were to confer equal gains upon all countries (which is what happens when countries have symmetric endowments), nothing would be lost by forsaking the freedom to pursue bilateral FTAs since such agreements would not even arise in equilibrium. Does this imply that bilateralism is irrelevant for the ultimate objective of achieving global free trade? Or are there circumstances under which the quest for global free trade is a¤ected in a material way by the freedom (or the lack of it) to pursue bilateral FTAs? We show next that when endowment levels are asymmetric across countries, bilateral FTAs can not only arise in equilibrium but the freedom to sign such agreements can be necessary for achieving multilateral free trade.

Trade liberalization under asymmetry

From hereon, we drop the assumption that endowment levels are symmetric across countries. In what follows, the size of a country is measured by its endowment of non-numeraire/protected goods relative to others. In this context, it is worth recalling that each country' s endowment of the (unique) good it imports is zero and that asymmetry in endowments translates directly into asymmetries of volume of exports. In other words, an increase in a country' s endowment in this model increases its exports of non-numeraire/protected goods without increasing its imports of such goods (since the model is partial equilibrium in nature and lacks any income
In fact, we can show that under symmetry global free trade is the unique strong Nash equilibrium under both bilateralism and multilateralism.

e¤ects). Indeed, since the country with the largest endowment of non-numeraire goods faces relatively smaller suppliers, its imports of such goods are the smallest. It is worth emphasizing that in our model no country is a price taker on world markets ­ in fact each country is the unique importer of a single good and therefore has market power that it can exploit via a tari¤. We next derive optimal tari¤s under each regime under asymmetry.

5.1

Optimal tari¤s

Country i' s optimal non-discriminatory (or MFN) tari¤ is given by: ej + ek 8

ti

Arg max wi ( ) =

(15)

Note that a country' s MFN tari¤ increases with the endowments of its trading partners. Similar to (8), when countries i and j form a bilateral FTA hfij gi, they abolish tari¤s on each other and choose their external tari¤s independently. We have tf i 5ek 11 4ej and tf j 5ek 11 4ei

Arg max wi (ij ) =

Arg max wj (ij ) =

(16)

It is easy to see that the external tari¤ of an FTA member increases with the endowment of the non-member whereas it decreases with that of its FTA partner.18 Similarly, a comparison of ti and tf i implies that the magnitude of the tari¤ complementarity e¤ect increases with the size of partner country' s endowment whereas it decreases with the endowment of the non-member country. To guarantee that all tari¤s are positive and non-prohibitive, given (16) we assume that minfei ; ej ; ek g
4 5

maxfei ; ej ; ek g.

Finally, under the multilateral agreement hfij m gi countries i and j choose the tari¤ pair
m m m (tm i , tj ) to maximize wi (ij ) + wj (ij ). We have

tm i =
18

2ek 7

ej

and tm j =

2ek 7

ei

(17)

It is obvious that the same optimal tari¤ obtains for a spoke country under a hub and spoke trading regime. By contrast, since the hub has an FTA with both spokes, it practices free trade.

5.2

Incentives for bilateral trade liberalization

How does a country' s incentive to form a bilateral FTA with another depend on the distribution of endowments across countries? We address this key question by breaking it up into parts and stating three related lemmas:19 Lemma 2a: Let country j be an FTA partner of country i under regime r but not under regime v and let the status of country k be the same under both regimes (i.e. either it is a partner of country i under both regimes or not ). Then, the following holds:
@ w i (r v ) . @ei @ w i (r v ) @ej

0

The intuition underlying the

@ w i (r v ) @ei

0 is as follows. Due to the smaller volume of

their exports, countries with smaller endowments bene...t less from tari¤ reductions granted by others. Similarly, such countries have relatively more to lose from eliminating their own optimal tari¤s since these tari¤s apply to relatively larger import volumes (or to relatively inelastic export supply curves). Thus, a country' s willingness to enter into a bilateral trade agreement with another depends positively on its own endowment. A similar intuition underlies the other inequality (i.e.
@ w i (r v ) @ej

0). The smaller the

endowment of a country' s partner, the larger the increase in its export surplus from the elimination of its partner' s optimal tari¤ and the smaller the loss due to its own trade liberalization since the tari¤ reduction applies to a smaller volume of imports (due to the smaller size of its partner). The two inequalities reported in Lemma 2a imply that a country prefers to form a bilateral FTA with the smaller of its two trading partners:

wi (ij )

wi (ik ) i¤ ek

ej :

(18)

How does the endowment level of a competing exporter, denoted by k , a¤ect the incentive of country i to form a bilateral FTA with country j ? Lemma 2b: Let country j be an FTA partner of country i under regime r but not under regime v and let the status of country k be the same under both regimes (i.e. either it is a
Welfare levels under all possible regimes are reported in the appendix and these can be used to prove Lemma 2a through Lemma 4.

16

partner of country i under both regimes or not). Then, (i)
@ w i (r v ) @ek

0 if country k is an FTA partner of country j under regimes r and v ;

whereas (ii)
@ w i (r v ) @ek

0 if country k is not an FTA partner of country j under regimes r and v .

The ...rst part of the above lemma captures the idea that when country k is already an FTA partner of country j , country i' s welfare gain from a bilateral FTA with country j decreases with the endowment of country k . Why is this true? Recall that both countries i and k export the same good to country j (i.e. they are competing exporters). When country k already enjoys free access to country j ' s market, the larger is country k ' s endowment the smaller the increase in country i' s export surplus that results from the trade liberalization undertaken by country j . The intuition behind part (ii) of the lemma is analogous ­when its rival exporter (i.e. country k ) is not an FTA partner of country j , the strategic advantage gained by country i in country j ' s market from signing the bilateral FTA hfij gi increases in country k ' s size, making the FTA more valuable from its perspective. The following lemma examines the welfare implications of being a hub country (say i under hfihgi) relative to other trade regimes: Lemma 3: wi (ih) > maxfwi (ij ), wi (F ); wi ( )g for all i; j = a; b; c. The fact that hub country prefers hfihgi) to hfF gi informs us that the ...rst part of Lemma 1 generalizes to the case of asymmetric endowments. The intuition is the same as that under symmetry: relative to free trade, the hub country enjoys privileged access in both spoke countries. One implication of this lemma is worth stressing: a hub country has no incentive to unilaterally revoke either one or both of its FTAs.

5.3

Multilateral trade liberalization

How do the incentives of a country to form (or join to) a multilateral agreement depend on the underlying endowment structure? Lemma 4: Under multilateralism, the following hold: (i)
@ wi (ij m @ei )

> 0,

@ wi (ij m @ej

)

< 0 and

@ wi (ij m @ek

)

< 0; and

17

(ii)

@ wi (F ij m ) @ei

> 0,

@ wi (F ij m ) @ej

< 0 and

@ wi (F ij m ) @ek

< 0.

The intuition underlying all of the inequalities reported in Lemma 4 is quite analogous to that which underlies parallel results under bilateralism with only one exception ­i.e. whereas
@ wi (ij @ek )

> 0 under bilateralism when country k is a non-member country, the opposite is true
@ wi (ij m @ek )

under multilateralism, i.e.,

< 0. To see why this is the case recall that under the

multilateral agreement hfij gim , countries i and j lower their tari¤s on not only to each other but also on country k whereas under the bilateral agreement hfij gi they only lower tari¤s on each other. The larger is country k ' s endowment, the smaller the increase in the export surplus that countries i and j obtain due to the multilateral agreement hfij m gi since their rival exporter (i.e. country k ) captures a larger share of their markets.

5.4

Equilibrium trade agreements under asymmetry

To highlight the crucial role played by asymmetry, it proves instructive to consider a scenario where two countries (denoted by l and l0 ) have larger endowments than the third (denoted by s; refereed to as the ` smaller'country).20 Accordingly, let the pattern of endowment asymmetry be given by:21 Assumption 2a: es = e < el = el0 = e and 1 5 4 (19)

To avoid redundancy, we focus directly on stable agreements under bilateralism. First consider the perspective of the two larger countries. We know from Lemma 1 that spoke countries are worse o¤ relative to free trade under symmetry. Similarly, Lemma 2a and Lemma 2b imply that
20

@ w l (F l 0 h) @es

0 and

@ wl (F sh) @es

0. Thus, a larger country (say l) under free

As noted earlier, in our model no country is ` small' in the traditional sense since all three can in uence their terms of trade. Hence we use the word ` smaller'as opposed to ` small' . 21 An earlier version of the paper also analyzed the case where es = es0 = e < el = e and 5 > 1. To save 4 space, we omit a detailed discussion here and simply note that analogous results hold under this alternative type of asymmetry.

18

trade has no incentive to revoke one of its FTAs and become a spoke: l0 h) > 0 for all

wl (F

sh) > 0 and

wl (F

(20)

Similarly, we know from (10) that under symmetry, starting from global free trade a country has no incentive to unilaterally revoke its two FTAs. Lemma 2a and Lemma 2b reinforce this result for the larger countries under asymmetry. We have: @ wl (F @es sl0 ) @ wl (F @es | {z
0

=

sh) }

+

Therefore, a larger country (say l) prefers hfF gi to hfsl0 gi: wl (F sl0 ) > 0 for all

@ wl (sh @es | {z
0

sl0 ) }

0

(21)

(22)

Thus, inequalities (20) and (22) show that a larger country has no unilateral incentive to defect from free trade. It is immediate from (20) that a joint defection from free trade to any hub and spoke regime does not occur. This implies we only need to consider three possible joint defections from free trade: (JF1): Joint deviation of l and s from hfF gi to hfslgi. (JF2): Joint deviation of l and l0 from hfF gi to hfll0 gi. (JF3): Joint deviation of l and s or l and l0 or all countries from hfF gi to hf gi. We know from inequality (11) that under symmetry ( = 1) no two countries bene...t from excluding the third country from free trade. Furthermore, we show in the appendix that wl (F sl) is monotonically decreasing in and that wl (F sl) > 0 at the smallest possible

endowment of country s (i.e. at wl (F

5 = 4 ) . This implies that joint deviation JF1 cannot occur:

sl) > 0 for all . It is immediate from this and inequality (18) that the two larger wl (F ll0 ) > 0 for all

countries have no incentive to jointly deviate from hfF gi to hfll0 gi:

19

. Therefore, joint deviation JF2 is also ruled out. Finally, the fact that

wl (F

sl) > 0

together with inequalities (9) and Lemma 2a implies that joint deviation JF3 also does not occur: wl (F ) > 0 for all . Thus, we have shown the following:

Lemma 5: Suppose Assumption 2a holds. Then, there exist no unilateral or coalitional deviations of larger countries from free trade. Lemma 5 suggests that the stability of global free trade depends critically upon the preferences of the smaller country. Let

­Figure 1here ­ Proposition 3a relates the degree of underlying asymmetry to the nature of stable agreements. Part (i ) simply says that if the degree of endowment asymmetry is su¢ ciently small, free trade is uniquely stable. This implies that Proposition 1 does not require symmetry but rather that the degree of endowment asymmetry be su¢ ciently small. Part (ii ) says that if the degree of endowment asymmetry is moderate, both a bilateral trade agreement between a smaller and a larger country and a bilateral FTA between the two larger countries are stable whereas part (iii ) says that if the degree of endowment asymmetry is su¢ ciently large, only an FTA between the two larger countries is stable ­ in such a situation, the smaller country

20

prefers being a non-member to participating in multilateral free trade.22 It is noteworthy that multiple stable equilibria obtain when the degree of endowment asymmetry is moderate ­i.e. when

about which of these equilibria might be observed, we examine both of these possibilities hereafter.

When, why, and how bilateralism matters

To see how the ability to form bilateral FTAs matters, suppose countries were to follow only a multilateral approach to trade liberalization. Under such an approach, there are only stable equilibria: hfslm gi and fll0 g . To see why, ...rst note that Lemma 5 implies that there can be no coalitional deviations from hfF gi to hf gi. Furthermore, Lemma 4 implies that the larger country l0 has no incentive to unilaterally deviate from hfF gi to hfslm gi. This implies that hfslm gi is not stable. In fact, the only deviation from free trade that we need to consider is the unilateral deviation of the smaller country from hfF gi to fll0 g . It turns out that this deviation does not occur if the degree of endowment asymmetry is small enough: ll0 )

under bilateralism is hfF gi whereas under multilateralism it is fll0 g . ­Figure 3 here­ Part (i ) of proposition 4 says that free trade is stable over a larger parameter space when countries are free to sign bilateral FTAs relative to when they cannot. Part (ii ) demonstrates that there exist circumstances where the freedom to pursue bilateral FTAs is necessary for achieving global free trade. This happens because the smaller country has a greater incentive to choose global free trade under bilateralism due to the fact that it is discriminated against its rival exporter in each larger member country' s market under the bilateral FTA hfll0 gi whereas it su¤ers no such disadvantage under the multilateral agreement hfll0m gi ­i.e. opting out of global free trade is relatively costlier for the smaller country under bilateralism. It is noteworthy that this result obtains even though the smaller country faces lower tari¤s in its export markets under the bilateral FTA between the two larger countries hfll0 gi relative to that under the multilateral agreement fll0 g . Thus, if the degree of endowment asymmetry is not too large, the threat of a bilateral FTA between the two larger countries and the discrimination that is inherent to such a trade agreement can be necessary to nudge the smaller country to

announce in favor of global free trade. The very fact that the multilateral agreement is nondiscriminatory in nature makes it less e¤ective in altering the trade-o¤ facing the smaller country since it does not lose as much from opting out of global free trade.23 When >
s (F

ll0 ), global free trade fails to obtain under both bilateralism and multi-

lateralism. Intuitively, if the smaller country is su¢ ciently small, then even the possibility of a bilateral FTA between the two larger countries is not enough to induce it to opt for global free trade. When such is the case, one possible way forward is to ask how global welfare compares under the equilibrium agreements that obtain under bilateralism and multilateralism. From Proposition 3b we know that under bilateralism both hfll0 gi and hfslgi are stable agreements when
s (F

ll0 ) <

l0 (lh

sl) whereas hfll0 gi is uniquely stable when

>

l0 (lh

sl).

Furthermore, Proposition 3b says that when global free trade does not obtain under multilateralism, fll0 g emerges as the unique stable equilibrium. Thus, when
m

>

s (F

ll0 ),

we need to consider two possible scenarios: (1) hfll0 gi is stable or (2) hfslgi is stable. First, consider scenario (1) and note that lower internal and external tari¤s (thus freer trade) obtain
f under hfll0 gi relative to fll0 g : tm l > tl . Thus, larger trade volumes and higher aggregate

world welfare obtain under hfll0 gi relative to fll0 g : appendix that ww(sl ll0 ) > 0 when

Now consider scenario (2) where hfslgi is the stable bilateral agreement. We show in the
s (F

ll0 ) <

<

l0 (lh

sl). In other words, over the

relevant parameter range, global welfare is higher under the bilateral agreement hfslgi relative to the multilateral agreement fll0 g . Thus, when free trade is out of reach, the option to pursue bilateral FTAs can yield welfare-improving trade liberalization that is foregone under a strictly multilateral approach.24
It is worth noting here that the result reported in part (i ) of Proposition 4 depends crucially on the fact that, relative to the status quo, the degree of the positive externality enjoyed by the non-member is stronger m under the multilateral agreement fll0 g relative to the bilateral FTA hfll0 gi. In an alternative model, the relative strength of this positive externality under the two types of agreements might be reversed. And if so, the incentives for participating in global free trade could be stronger when discriminatory bilateral agreements are not permitted. 24 Of course, aggregate world welfare does not necessarily speak to the fate of individual countries. It is immediate form (24) that, when the freedom to pursue bilateral FTAs is necessary for achieving global free trade, large countries are better o¤ under bilateralism relative to multilateralism whereas the small country' s fate is the opposite.

Political economy considerations

In order to determine whether and how the presence of political economy considerations a¤ects our main results, suppose countries put additional weight on producer surplus relative to tari¤ revenue and consumer surplus: X

wi =

CSiz + T Ri + (1 + )

X
z

P Siz

(26)

Since the model lacks an import competing industry, the additional weight on producer surplus (i.e. ) has no e¤ect on the tari¤s countries implement under no agreement and a bilateral

FTA. As a result, domestic surplus stays unchanged under the bilateralism game. However, by increasing the importance of the export surplus gain that results from trade liberalization undertaken by partner countries, the additional weight on producer surplus makes participation in FTAs more desirable. On the other hand, under the multilateral agreement hfij m gi countries i and j internalize each other' s additional weights on export pro...ts and their respective MFN tari¤s fall with : tm i = 2ek (1 + 3 )ej 2ek and tm j = 7 (1 + 3 )ei 7

Otherwise, hfij m gi

the freedom to pursue bilateral FTAs can be necessary for achieving global free trade even when countries have symmetric endowments. To understand the intuition behind this result, consider

24

the perspective of the outside country (i.e. country k ) under hfij m gi: under multilateralism, the higher the weight on producer surplus, the lower the tari¤s faced by the outside country in its export markets. As a result, the incentive to opt out of multilateral trade liberalization increases with the degree of political economy pressure . By contrast, such a result does not obtain when the agreement involved is a bilateral FTA since the external tari¤s of FTA members are independent of the degree of political economy pressure faced by them. Now suppose that countries have asymmetric endowments. Let the pattern of endowment asymmetry be given by Assumption 2 and two countries (denoted by l and l0 ) have larger endowments than the third (denoted by s). As before, let

It is straightforward to show that Lemma 5 continues to hold under bilateralism ­i.e. the two larger countries do not deviate either unilaterally or coalitionally from free trade.

Conclusion

One of the striking features of today' s global policy landscape is the widespread prevalence of preferential trade agreements. Only a handful of countries are not involved in one and most simultaneously participate in several such agreements. Jagdish Bhagwati (1991) famously raised concern about the potential adverse e¤ects of the pursuit of preferential trade agreements on the prospects of multilateral trade liberalization. His work led to a rich body of research

26

that has illuminated various aspects of the multi-faceted relationship between preferential and multilateral trade liberalization. However, this literature has often tended to treat bilateral trade agreements as exogenous or only considered an endogenous trade agreement between a pair of countries while treating the third country as a silent observer. By contrast, we present a model in which all countries are free to pursue both bilateral and multilateral agreements. To determine whether bilateralism hampers or facilitates the obtainment of global free trade, we also derive stable equilibria under a purely multilateral approach to trade agreements. This analysis helps shed light on the pros and cons of bilateralism and multilateralism. A central result of this paper is that bilateralism can actually provide an impetus to multilateral trade liberalization. The point is that a country that is choosing whether or not to participate in global free trade must consider its fate under the agreement that would emerge in the absence of its participation. Due to the fact that a bilateral trade agreement discriminates against the outsider whereas a multilateral agreement does not, a non participating country is worse o¤ under the former relative to the latter. As a result, a country' s incentive to opt for free trade is stronger when the alternative to free trade is a bilateral agreement between the other two countries as opposed to a multilateral one. An important implication of our analysis is that to properly account for the role of bilateralism, we need to better understand why countries choose to enter into bilateral agreements when multilateral trade liberalization is an option. To this end, the model suggests that the debate regarding preferential versus multilateral liberalization is moot in the absence of some type of asymmetry across countries. This is because, in our model, whether or not countries are free to pursue bilateral trade agreements, global free trade is the only stable equilibrium under symmetry. This result demonstrates that heterogeneity across countries with respect to the bene...ts that they enjoy from global free trade may be a critical determinant of the success of a purely multilateral approach to trade liberalization. In our view, such heterogeneity has received insu¢ cient attention in the literature and its role merits further research.

It is immediate from (20) that the two larger countries jointly defect from hfshgi to hfF gi and this defection is self-enforcing since neither has an incentive to further defect (Lemma 5). Thus, hfshgi is not stable. Similarly, the smaller country defects unilaterally from hflhgi to hfll0 gi so that hflhgi is not stable.25 Next, we provide conditions under which hfslgi and hfll0 gi are stable. There exist ...ve possible coalitional deviations from hfslgi: (JSL1): Deviation of l and l0 from hfslgi to hfll0 gi. (JSL2): Deviation of s and l0 from hfslgi to hfshgi. (JSL3): Deviation of l and l0 from hfslgi to hflhgi. (JSL4): Deviation of all countries from hfslgi to hfl0 hgi. (JSL5): Deviation of all countries from hfslgi to hfF gi. Note from (18) that country l will not defect from hfslgi to hfll0 gi. Thus, JSL1 is ruled out. Next consider JSL2 and JSL3. We know from Lemma 3 that country s (l) has an incentive to defect from hfslgi to hfshgi (hflhgi). For these deviations to occur, the choice of country l is pivotal. We have wl0 (sh and wl0 (lh

Since

l0 (lh

l0 (sh

sl), JSL3 is the binding deviation.

Now consider JSL4. Since the smaller country has an incentive to unilaterally deviate from hfl0 hgi to hfll0 gi, even if JSL4 occurs, it is not self-enforcing. Finally, we know from (23) that JSL5 occurs when is stable i¤

We now derive conditions under which hfll0 gi is stable. Inequality (29) implies that there can be no deviations from hfll0 gi to hf gi. Now consider the following coalitional deviations: (JLL1): Deviation of s and l from hfll0 gi to hfslgi. (JLL2): Deviation of s and l from hfll0 gi to hflhgi. (JLL3): Deviation of all countries from hfll0 gi to hfshgi. (JLL4): Deviation of all countries from hfll0 gi to hfF gi. From Lemma 3, it is immediate that JLL1 is not a self-enforcing deviation since country l has an incentive to further deviate to hflhgi : Moreover, JLL2 is ruled out since country s does not have an incentive to defect from hfll0 gi to hflhgi. We also know from (20) that even if JLL3 occurs, the two larger countries further deviate from hfshgi to hfF gi. Thus the initial deviation is not self-enforcing. Finally, (23) implies that all countries deviate from hfll0 gi to hfF gi when
s (F

These inequalities imply that hf gi is not stable. We know from (20) that two larger countries jointly defect from hfshgi to hfF gi when = 0. This defection also occurs for any > 0 and is self-enforcing since neither country has an incentive to further defect. Therefore, hfshgi is not stable. Now consider hflhgi.26 The smaller country defects from hflhgi to hfll0 gi unless

p s (lh

ws (lh

p s (lh

the joint deviation of countries s and l0 from hflhgi to hfF gi is self-enforcing so that hflhgi fails to be stable. Next consider hfslgi and hfll0 gi. We know from (34) that unilateral defections from hfslgi to hf gi and hfll0 gi to hf gi do not occur. There exist ...ve possible coalitional deviations from hfslgi:

An analogous discussion applies to hfl0 hgi.

(JSL4-P): Deviation of all countries from hfslgi to hfl0 hgi. (JSL5-P): Deviation of all countries from hfslgi to hfF gi. JSL1-P is ruled out since country l does not defect from hfslgi to hfll0 gi. Next consider JSL2-P and JSL3-P. We know from Lemma 3 that country s (l) has an incentive to defect from hfslgi to hfshgi (hflhgi). For these deviations to occur, the choice of country l is pivotal.

Next note that since country l has no incentive to deviate from hfslgi to hfl0 hgi, JSL4P does not occur.

For hfll0 gi to be stable, we need to consider the following coalitional deviations: (JLL1-P): Deviation of s and l from hfll0 gi to hfslgi. (JLL2-P): Deviation of s and l from hfll0 gi to hflhgi. (JLL3-P): Deviation of all countries from hfll0 gi to hfshgi. (JLL4-P): Deviation of all countries from hfll0 gi to hfF gi. Note that JLL1-P is not a self-enforcing deviation since country l has an incentive to further deviate to hflhgi and JLL2-P happens only when <

deviation. Even if JLL3-P occurs, the larger countries further deviate from hfshgi to hfF gi, making the initial deviation not self-enforcing. Finally, all countries deviate from hfll0 gi to hfF gi when <
