Abstract: Glass polyalkenoate cements (GPCs) have potential for skeletal cementation. Unfortunately, commercial GPCs all contain, and subsequently release, aluminum ions, which have been implicated in degenerative brain disease. The purpose of this research was to create a series of aluminum-free GPCs constructed from silicate (SiO2 ), calcium (CaO), zinc (ZnO) and sodium (Na2 O)-containing glasses mixed with poly-acrylic acid (PAA) and to evaluate the potential of these cements for cranioplasty applications. Three glasses were formulated based on the SiO2 -CaO-ZnO-Na2 O parent glass (KBT01) with 0.03 mol % (KBT02) and 0.06 mol % (KBT03) germanium (GeO2 ) substituted for ZnO. Each glass was then mixed with 50 wt % of a patented SiO2 -CaO-ZnO-strontium (SrO) glass composition and the resultant mixtures were subsequently reacted with aqueous PAA (50 wt % addition) to produce three GPCs. The incorporation of Ge in the glass phase was found to result in decreased working (142 s to 112 s) and setting (807 s to 448 s) times for the cements manufactured from them, likely due to the increase in crosslink formation between the Ge-containing glasses and the PAA. Compressive (c ) and biaxial flexural (f ) strengths of the cements were examined at 1, 7 and 30 days post mixing and were found to increase with both maturation and Ge content. The bonding strength of a titanium cylinder (Ti) attached to bone by the cements increased from 0.2 MPa, when placed, to 0.6 MPa, after 14 days maturation. The results of this research indicate that Germano-Silicate based GPCs have suitable handling and mechanical properties for cranioplasty fixation.

1. Introduction Titanium miniplates and screws are used to repair defects in cranioplasty surgeries [1,2]. While these materials can be secured to the surrounding bone using calcium phosphate cements, success has been limited due to the characteristic brittleness of such materials [3,4], meaning that they are unable to resist the forces applied during installation [5]. Poly-methylmethacrylate (PMMA) is often used in cranioplasty but also has limited success; it can cause an impairment of the body's natural defenses, leaving patients susceptible to infection [6,7]. Almost 7% of PMMA alloplastic cranioplasties suffer some form of displacement and/or fracture [7­18]. Additionally, PMMA has a high curing exotherm of up to 120  C, which can result in necrosis of healthy bone tissue [6], leading to the loosening of the prosthesis [19]; a problem exacerbated by PMMA's lack of chemical adhesion to bone [20]. Although they have not been used clinically in cranioplasty, Glass Polyalkenoate Cements (GPCs) have potential in this space as, unlike PMMA, they chemically bond with bone. Though the use of

GPCs has been restricted to dental [21] and ear, nose and throat (ENT) applications [22,23], attempts have been made to tailor these materials as orthopedic adhesives. For example, titanium has been substituted for silicon in the glass phase of GPCs in order to improve the cement's mechanical and biological properties [24]. Zinc and silver ions have been added to the glass phase of GPCs because of their antimicrobial activity [25], and strontium ions (Sr2+ ) have been substituted for calcium ions (Ca2+ ) in order to increase radiopacity of the cement and stimulate bone formation around the implantation site [26­28]. Germanium (Ge) adopts the role of a network former when incorporated into an ionomer glass, and is theoretically capable of isomorphically replacing Si in the network [29]. Germanium based glasses have previously been investigated by Dickey et al. [30­32] who reported that glass reactivity decreased with Ge incorporation, resulting in GPCs with extended working times of up to 10 min, setting times between 14 and 36 min, and compression strengths in surplus of 30 MPa after 30 days maturation [30]. Ge was also incorporated into borate-based ionomer glasses (BGG) by Zhang et al. [32,33] who reported that its presence increased handling properties of the resultant GPCS formulated from them [32]. This paper expands partly on Dickey and Zhang's work by investigating the applicability of germano-silicate glasses as components in GPCs for cranioplasty applications. We also build upon the authors own previous work on zinc silicate-based GPCs by evaluating the effect on the physical and mechanical properties of these GPCs by incrementally replacing the Zn in the glass component with Ge [6,34]. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Glass Synthesis Three glass compositions, KBT01, KBT02 and KBT03, were formulated. The control, KBT01, was a SiO2 -CaO-ZnO-Na2 O glass; KBT02 and KBT03 contain incremental concentrations of Ge added at the expense of Zn (Table 1). Glasses were prepared by weighing out appropriate amounts of analytical grade reagents and ball milling (1 h). Each mix was then oven dried (100  C, 1 h) and fired (1500  C, 1 h) in a pure Silica ceramic crucible and shock quenched into water. The resulting frit was dried, ground and sieved to retrieve a glass powder with a maximum particle size of <45 µm.

2.2. Glass Characterization 2.2.1. Network Connectivity (NC) The network connectivity of the glasses was calculated using Equation (1) [6] considering that SiO2 and GeO2 acted as network formers and CaO, ZnO and Na2 O as network modifiers. NC " No : BOs ´ No : NBOs Total No : Bridging species (1)

where NC = Network Connectivity, BO = Bridging Oxygens, NBO = Non-Bridging Oxygens. 2.2.2. Powder X-ray Diffraction (XRD) XRD patterns were collected using a PANanlytical X'Pert PRO (PANanlytical Inc., St Laurent, QC, Canada). Glass powder samples were attached to a stainless steel disc using a 20 mm glass slide. The powder compacts were then placed in the X-ray Diffractometer and scanned in the range 10 < 2 < 80 , at scan step size 0.05 and step time of 10 s. A generator voltage of 45 kV and a tube current of 40 mA were employed using Cu k X-ray source. 2.2.3. Particle Size Analysis (PSA) Particle size analysis was performed using a Coulter Ls 100 Fluid module Particle size analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). The glass powder samples were evaluated in the range of 0­950 µm with a run length of 60 s. The suspension fluid used in this case was glycerol and was used at a temperature of 37  C. The relevant volume statistics were calculated on each glass. 2.3. Cement Characterization 2.3.1. Cement Preparation Cements were prepared by first mixing each of the KBT series of glasses (<45 µm; un-annealed) with BT101 glass (un-annealed) at a 1:1 ratio and then combining that mixture with PAA and distilled water on a glass plate at a powder to liquid (P:L) ratio of 1:1 using 1 g of glass powder (0.5 g of KBT and 0.5 g BT101) and a 50 wt % solution of PAA (0.5 g of acid and 0.5 mL of water). The same nomenclature (i.e., KBT01, KBT02 and KBT03) were used for the cements as for the primary glass composition that they were formulated from. 2.3.2. Handling Characteristics (Tw and Ts ) The cement working time (Tw ), measured in ambient temperatures using a stopwatch, was defined as the period of time from the start of mixing during which it was possible to manipulate the material without having an adverse effect on its properties [35]. The setting time of the cements was measured in accordance with ISO9917 [36]. An empty mould was placed on aluminum foil and filled to a level surface with the freshly mixed cement. Sixty seconds after mixing the entire assembly was placed on a metal block (8 mm ^ 75 mm ^ 100 mm) in an oven maintained at 37  C. Ninety seconds after mixing, a Vicat needle indenter (mass, 400 g) was lowered onto the surface of the cement. The needle was allowed to remain on the surface for five seconds, the indent was then observed and the process repeated every thirty seconds until the needle failed to make a complete circular indent when viewed at ^2 magnification. The net setting time of three tests was recorded. 2.4. Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (SEM-EDX) Backscattered electron (BSE) imaging was carried out with a JEOL Co. JSM-6380LV (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Compositional analysis was performed with an EDX Genesis Energy-Dispersive

Spectrometer. All EDX spectra were collected at 20 kV using a beam current of 26 nA. Quantitative EDX spectra were subsequently converted into relative concentration data. 2.5. Mechanical Properties 2.5.1. Compressive Strength The compressive strengths (c ) of five cement samples of each formulation were evaluated in ambient air (23  1  C) according to ISO9917 [36]. Samples were tested after 1, 7 and 30 days using an Instron Universal Testing Systems (Instron Corp, Norwood, MA, USA) fitted with a 2 kN load cell at a crosshead speed of 1 mm¨ min´1 . The moulds, 4 mm Ø, by 6 mm height in line with ISO9917 [36], were filled to excess with freshly mixed cement then covered with acetate sheet. The mould/cement/acetate constructs were then sandwiched between two stainless steel plates, clamped and incubated (37  C, 1 h). The constructs were subsequently unclamped and excess flash around the moulds was removed using 1200 grit silicon carbide paper. Once ground the samples were de-moulded, placed in distilled water and incubated in water (37  C) for 1, 7 and 30 days. Compressive strength, c , was calculated according to Equation (2) [36]: c " 4 d2 (2)

where  = maximum applied load (N), d = diameter of sample (mm). 2.5.2. Biaxial Flexural Strength Sixty seconds after mixing commenced for each cement, rubber moulds (8 mm Ø, 2 mm thick) were filled to excess with cement and placed between 2 stainless steel plates, clamped, and incubated (37  C, 1 h). The samples were subsequently de-moulded and incubated in distilled water for 1, 7 and 30 days. The biaxial flexural strength (f ) of the cements was determined in a similar fashion to that of Williams et al. [37] which uses three support bearings on the test jig fixed to an Instron Universal Testing Systems (Instron Corp, Norwood, MA, USA) apparatus using a load cell of 1 kN. Testing was performed at a crosshead speed of 1 mm¨ min´1 . Five samples for each cement formulation and incubation time were tested. f was calculated according to Equation (3) [37].

Sample Preparation To reflect the clinical situation as closely as possible, the adhesive properties of each of the GPCs to a titanium alloy (McMaster Carr, Aurora, OH, USA) were determined using a method comparable to ASTM B348 [38]. Figure 1A,B illustrates the materials used in the construction of the test rig. A layer of the GPC (KBT01, KBT02 and KBT03) was applied to a 19.05 mm diameter cylinder of titanium alloy (McMaster Carr, Aurora, OH, USA), which was then attached to both fresh ovis aries cranial bone and titanium plate (ASTM B265) [39]. Figure 1C displays a layer of one of the GPCs, Figure 1D shows the Ti and bone samples used and Figure 1E is the anchor that is screwed into the threaded center of the Ti cylinder. Five specimens were prepared for each cement composition. Materials were then left to mature (1 h, 37  C) before being submerged in a single container of distilled water (37  C). The procedure was repeated for samples submerged for 1, 7, and 14 days.

2.7. Ion-Release The concentrations of Si, Zn, Sr, Na, Ge and Ca ions released from the cements were determined by analyzing the water extracts in which samples of each set cement were stored using a Perkin Elmer atomic absorption spectrometer 800 (AAS800, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). 10 mL aliquots of deionized water were kept at 37  C in lidded containers. Samples (n = 5) of each cement (8 mm Ø, 2 mm thick) were then stored for 1, 7 and 30 days in water. Following removal of cement samples from their aliquots, a 1:10 dilution of the storage water was made using purified water. Calibration standards for Si, Ge, Ca, Zn, Na and Sr elements were prepared from a stock solution on a gravimetric basis. Five target calibration standards were prepared for each ion with 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 1.0 part per million (ppm) concentrations with distilled water was used as a blank. Samples for Ge, Ca, Zn, Na and Sr ion analysis were diluted in a ratio of 1:10; that is, each 1 mL of concentrated sample was mixed with 10 mL of distilled water while samples for Si analysis were diluted in a ratio of 1:30. A pilot study was conducted to determine the appropriate ratio for dilution of all elements. The optimal working conditions are listed in Table 3.

2.8. Micro-CT Analysis Radiopacity of the cements were determined and compared to a cortical bone standard using a General Electric Healthcare explore Locus SP microCT scanner (Milwaukee, WI, USA). An initial scan was performed, giving an overall X-ray image from which an area of focus was then selected for scanning at full resolution (30 µm). Each of the KBT cement samples were paired with an SP3 calibration standard and placed into a full resolution scan. Images were then reconstructed and the density of the cement samples was measured using affiliated software. 2.9. Statistical Analysis One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the data for handling and mechanical properties. A Post hoc Bonferroni test was used to compare the relative means and to report the statistically significant differences when p < 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (IBM SPSS statistics 21, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Glass Characterization X-ray Diffraction (XRD) XRD was performed to determine whether any crystalline phases were present within the KBT glasses (Figure 3). The BT101 glass was sourced from a batch previously confirmed to be amorphous [27]. 3.2. Particle Size Distribution Analysis (PSA) All glasses when evaluated by particle size analysis, return a d50 value of between 8.32 µm and 8.69 Particle size of the glass phase will impact both rheology and mechanical properties of GPCs formulated from them; for example, increases in the surface area of the glass component will reduce setting time [40] and likely increase compressive strength [40]. However, the comparable particle sizes between sample sets in the glasses herein would not be responsible for any recorded changes in

5. Limitations of the Study There are a lack of current ISO/ASTM standards for cranioplasty, meaning that it was not possible to target the aims of the research against such standards. Additionally, no biocompatibility data was recorded for these materials to date; this will be addressed in future studies.
