Abstract     
This major research paper (MRP) examines the visual social semiotics of Canadian politicians' Instagram accounts and their followers' responses. As a qualitative study, it seeks to address the following questions: From the coded images in the data collection, which qualities do the Instagram followers prefer? From the coded images in the data collection, which qualities do the Instagram followers prefer the least? What do these qualities reveal about the political actors in the data collection? To answer these questions, I coded the most liked and least liked Instagram postings between April 1, 2014 and March 31, 2015 from two of Canada's federal party leaders, Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Liberal leader Justin Trudeau. These images were coded through a visual social semiotics analysis under the following categories in my codebook: community outreach, competence, empathy, excitement, ideology, personal, symbols of nationalism, celebrity, and miscellaneous. This codebook was constructed from a literature review encompassing the public's values of politicians in traditional media. The findings of this MRP expand on visual social semiotic theory in the social media context and build on research about audience perceptions of politicians. The results suggest that photo composition and the presentations of values in an image are important considerations for politicians. Based on the findings, this study is relevant to how professional communicators can construct a persuasive image and story in the political context on a social media platform.

Introduction  
   Since 1956, when presidential candidate Dwight Eisenhower first began advertising on TV, campaign strategies have shifted from grassroots mobilization to multi-media strategies (Guzmán and Sierra, 2009). In the 1990s, political branding entered the lexicon (Delacourt, 2013, p. 143) and this shift defines today's state of political image maintenance and strategy. Prior to the myriad of social media platform options, photographers "took pictures for the history books... Now the Internet has given [the political parties] a canvas for all of these pictures" (LeBlanc, 2015). Because brand strategy and image maintenance are still new concepts for the political sphere, the widely used image-sharing app Instagram, in particular, presents an interesting space for investigation, and it is this space that this pilot study will use as its focus. In this major research paper (MRP), I will explore audience perception of politicians' image use on social media in the theoretical framework of visual social semiotics. As my literature review will highlight, social media in the political arena is well researched. Audience response to political appearance is also well researched in this area, but it is primarily focused on its relationship in traditional print media or websites alone, and the research focuses on Canada's international counterparts. Because of this, through my research, I will update the current understanding of image development and audience perception of politicians in the context of social media and federal Canadian politics. For this pilot study, I aim to answer the following research questions:

  

1  

RQ1: From the coded images in the data collection, which qualities do the Instagram followers prefer? RQ2: From the coded images in the data collection, which qualities do the Instagram followers prefer the least? RQ3: What do these preferred qualities reveal about the political actors in my data collection?

The result of this pilot study will address a research gap surrounding politicians' use of social media because the current focus tends to be on Twitter and Facebook. While there is extensive research available on what members of the public value in politicians, there is limited research about how image translates these values on new social media platforms. This pilot study will also be relevant to how professional communicators can construct an image, brand, and narrative in the political context on a social media platform like Instagram. The results suggest that photo composition via the framework of visual social semiotics and the presentations of values in the image are important considerations for politicians and their individual brands. I will next outline the theoretical background for this pilot study with a summary of Gunther Kress and Theo van Leeuwen's theory of visual social semiotics.    Theoretical  Backing      Visual social semiotics is often applied to advertising (van Leeuwen, 2005; Harrison, 2003; Scott and Vargas, 2007; and Berger, 2010), but the goal of this pilot study is to apply this theoretical lens to a new digital medium. Before discussing the

  

2  

existing literature, I will first outline the theoretical positioning and its relevance to my research. This pilot study will research audience perception and values of politicians on Instagram from the lens of visual social semiotics. The theory will ultimately guide and help code the images for their key values. I will describe this in more detail in my methodology section. Specifically, I will be drawing on Gunther Kress and Theo van Leeuwen's (2006) The Grammar of Visual Design, but I recognize semiotics and visual social semiotics is theorized by Barthes (1972), Rose (2012), and others as well and their research is important to the theory's overall development. Kress and van Leeuwen's (2006) theory will be put into practice and provide a framework to help determine the Instagram images' values. Because social semiotics reflects the use of signs and their constructed meaning within a community, it lends itself to a social networking platform that is heavily image-based, like Instagram. Visual social semiotics is based on the study of semiotics, or the study of signs where "sign systems and the use of signs are the productive agents of thought and society" (Craig and Muller, 2007, p. 163). Visual semiotics is "a synthesis of several modern approaches to the study of social meaning and social action... Social semiotics includes formal semiotics and goes on to ask how people use signs to construct life of a community" (Harrison, 2003, p. 48, quoting Lemke, 1990). Harrison (2003) further defines visual social semiotics as "the description of semiotic resources, what can be said and done with images (and other visual means of communication) and how the things people say and do with images can be interpreted" (p. 48, quoting Jewitt and Oyama,

  

3  

2001). Visual social semiotics includes three metafunctions: ideational, interpersonal and textual. The ideational metafunction discusses the participants and their existence. These participants can be interactive or representative. When it is interactive, the participants are "in the act of communication... [they] speak and listen or write and read, make images or view them" (Kress and van Leeuwen, 2006, p. 48). Participants who are classified as representative are "represented in and by the speech or writing or image, the participants about whom or which we are speaking or writing or producing images" (Kress and van Leeuwen, 2006, p. 48). Kress and van Leeuwen (2006) note this is complex when taking into account "real" interactive participants, the "real" imageproducers and­viewers and the "implied" image producers and­viewers (p. 48). If the objects are participating, often a vector is present, meaning the objects represent "doing something to or for each other" (Kress and van Leeuwen, 2006, p. 59). Bodies "in action" can form vectors but Kress and van Leeuwen (2006) also state that vectors are formed through any form of action, like two lines meeting (p. 59). If there is a pattern that occurs over multiple images, the vectoral pattern creates a narrative (Kress and van Leeuwen, 2006, p. 59). A vector can be created between the participants and the audience viewing the image. This is more common in the interpersonal metafunction. Overall, the ideational metafunction requires a goal, specifically when "the participant at whom or which the vector is directed... is also the participant to whom or which action is done, or at whom or which the action is aimed" (Kress and van Leeuwen, 2006, p. 64). The interpersonal metafunction is meant to "represent a particular social relation between the producer, the viewer, and the object represented" (Kress and van Leeuwen,

  

4  

2006, p. 42). Kress and van Leeuwen (2006) call this eye contact a "demand," because it "demands that the viewer enter into some kind of imaginary relation with him or her" (p. 118). Without eye contact, Halliday (1985) calls the image an "offer" because "it `offers' the represented participants to the viewer as items of information, objects of contemplation, impersonally, as though they were specimens in a display case" (as quoted by Kress and van Leeuwen, 2006, p. 119). The meaning behind the demand is defined by how close the image is shot and at what angle. The distance of the object depends on their social relation (Kress and van Leeuwen, 2006, p. 125). Kress and van Leeuwen (2006) argue that a close shot is intimate and personal, a medium shot is social, and a long shot is impersonal (p. 148). Angles are also influential. A frontal angle suggests involvement, whereas an oblique angle suggests detachment. While an eye level angle shows neutrality or equality, a high angle gives the viewer power and a lower angle gives the participant power (Kress and van Leeuwen, 2006, p. 140). The interpersonal metafunction also uses colour saturation, depth, illumination, and brightness as "modality markers" (Kress and van Leeuwen, 2006, p. 160-163), and these markers compliment the textual metafunction. Finally, the textual metafunction focuses on the composition of the image. Kress and van Leeuwen (2006) argue that the interactions among participants in an image do not define its content (p. 176). Instead, the composition of the image does this, as decided through information value, salience, and framing (Kress and van Leeuwen, 2006, p. 177). Notably, this can be applied to multimodal texts, but this does not apply to this pilot study's research or data collection.

Visual social semiotics and its three metafunctions will serve as a way to find the values highlighted or emphasized in each Instagram photo. Based on Kress and van Leeuwen's (2006) theory, the tools they discuss will emphasize participants through their interactions, colouring, or positioning in the photo. Through this theory, I will contribute to the existing literature by exploring how the Instagram users create meaning and emphasize values in the images they post.                                                                                                          6  

Literature  Review    
Having outlined the theoretical positioning of this pilot study, I will now highlight previous studies to support my research. The literature survey in this paper examines three overarching themes: brand and image in the political realm, audience perception of politicians in traditional media, and politicians' use of social media. Combined, this existing literature provides context on current strategies and perspectives in both the Canadian and international political spheres.

Defining  Brand  and  Image        Branding is a relationship between consumer and company. It is a complex relationship because "it depends on a consumers' willingness to recognize and support the set of meanings, ideas, and associations the brand is trying to establish" (Cormack, 2012, p. 209). Yet despite this complex relationship, branding is a part of everyday life and deeply rooted in choice. French and Smith (2002, quoting Keller) argue, "branding principles have been applied in virtually every setting where consumer choice of some kind is involved" (p. 460). This includes the political arena, where "political marketing has developed into a recognised sub-discipline of political science" (Needham, 2006, p. 178). Quoting Kirchheimer (1996), French and Smith (2002) argue that branding and marketing in the political arena became necessary as an "inevitable response" to move "from mass based to catch-all parties" (p. 461). This move also led to unwanted outcomes, ranging from a narrowing political agenda to political disengagement at municipal levels (French and Smith, 2002, p. 461).    7  

Defining political branding is also often debated. For example, Marland and Flanagan (2013) define branding as an "evolution of image management," calling it a "strategic layer to the process of promoting a desired image," and in the political sphere specifically, it provides the "potential for political elites to employ propaganda" (p. 952953). However, Guzmán and Sierra (2009) argue in favour of traditional marketing theory, where political parties are framed as brands and politicians as products (p. 208). Given the popularity of social media and the increasing idea of politicians as celebrities (Street, 2004), this definition is slightly out-dated. Returning to the general sense of the word, a brand "rolls together the logo, products, advertising, image, customer service, investment opportunities, and production practices into one integrated and recognizable whole," all while evoking trust, commitment, or loyalty (Cormack, 2012, p. 210). Arguably, a political candidate carries many of these characteristics (as does their party, if running under one): he or she offers policies as products, advertises in the media and in grassroots campaigning, engages with the voters, and most importantly, as this pilot study will look at, a member of the public reacts to this whether it be by a vote, or simply liking a photo. Ultimately, Marland (2013) suggests that defining such terms is a "subjective exercise" (p. 13) and Cormack (2012) highlights the divided perspectives on political branding found in academic discussions (p. 210). For the purpose of this pilot study, the concept will not be debated. Instead it is accepted as a tool in political marketing. In this context, Entman's (1993) notion of framing guides my concept of an image for this pilot study. Framing is how the subject, or in this case, a politician, is presented to the public. Entman states that a frame's purpose "is to select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text" by defining problems,

  

8  

diagnosing causes, making moral judgements, and suggesting remedies (p. 52). The communication in a frame is done through salience, "making a piece of information more noticeable, meaningful, or memorable to audiences" (Entman, 1993, p. 53). While framing is often discussed in the context of text-based communication, salience is also discussed in Kress and van Leeuwen's (2006) textual metafunction. Entman's research is relevant to how politicians as a whole represent themselves in visual communication because framing "plays a major role in the exertion of political power" and image is a part of that arsenal (Entman, 1993, p. 55). The image is presented as a component of the brand strategy to the public, who then draws conclusions and recalls the image based on the strategy, communication tactics, and impressions. Image  Management  in  the  Canadian  Political  Context   Branding in Canadian politics is standardized practice now, but it is still a fairly young strategy. Marland and Flanagan (2013) summarize the changing methods in campaigns and elections: "If market research, spin and advertising were the key signifiers of marketed parties and candidates in the 1980s and 1990s, `branding' is the hallmark now" (Scammell, 2007, p. 176, as quoted by Marland and Flanagan, 2013). Voter motivation and decision-making researchers relied on Canadian Election studies from 1965 onward, but it was "largely confined to the public mood about politics" (Delacourt, 2013, p. 142). However, Delacourt (2013) also highlights a shift in the 1990s that indicated, "what people wanted as consumers, they wanted as voters" (p. 143). In quoting Allan Greg, political brand would have to target consumers so that they would answer "yes" to two key questions: "Are they like me and are they for me?" (Delacourt, 2013, p.

  

9  

143). Not only did politicians and parties need brands, but also the voters were seen as brands constructed by their individual values (Delacourt, 2013, p. 144). In the Canadian context, the literature suggests image is highly influential of voter behaviour during a federal election (Brown et. al. 1988, p. 729). However, the shift described by Delacourt (2013) and Marland and Flanagan (2013) is key in political branding and voter decision-making in Canada. Delacourt (2013) argues it is the "consumer-citizens' desire for authenticity" in the 1990s that drove the political branding and victory for Jean Chrétien and the federal Liberal Party (p. 148). For example, to highlight his authenticity before the election, Chrétien was photographed wearing "an ordinary guy's denim shirt" or water-skiing (Delacourt, 2013, p. 151). This is in correlation with American-based case studies where "nonverbal communication is politically important because expressive displays have been shown to have considerable persuasive influence" (Grabe and Bucy, 2009, "Facing the Electorate"). The literature surrounding social media and politics will again return to a similar discussion of authenticity in 2008, beginning with the U.S. presidential campaign of Barack Obama. Marland (2012) suggests that Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) carefully maintain Harper's public image and brand. First, since his election in 2006, Marland (2012) argues Harper maintained his image by hiring official photographers and excluding photojournalists when possible. This is detailed from anonymous sources in the federal Conservative Party, within the PMO, and from working journalists. For example, Marland's (2012) interviews revealed that Harper's "managed visuals are designed to reinforce the `common man' brand attributes of [Harper], and are an attempt to defy negative image stereotypes, such as juxtaposing

  

10  

Harper's patriotic love of hockey against perceptions that he is an aloof ideologue" (p. 222). Knowing his critiques, the Harper image is constructed to show him as a wellrounded individual with interests outside of politics. However, in a separate study, Marland (2014) often found Harper in "business clothing," on Parliament Hill, or with a Canadian flag nearby (p. 62). Second, Harper's wife, Laureen Harper, is often accredited with softening his image (Smyth, 2013). Marland (2014) compares Laureen Harper to a presidential first lady, where she is shown "speaking with world leaders and their spouses, being interviewed, hosting a diplomatic garden party, and participating in a roundtable discussion on women's rights" (p. 65). Her participation in this role adds to Harper's own role as prime minister. Marland's article (2012) emphasizes Harper's value of image management and its control. This control suggests its value both in and outside of an election period. Marland (2013) also details Justin Trudeau's political brand in the context of his father, Pierre Trudeau, and the idea of political legacies. He argues that Justin Trudeau is an "extension of his father's brand" in "pure marketing speak" (Marland, 2013, p. 9). Marland highlights this extension with three examples. First, there is some overlap with Pierre Trudeau's cult of personality and Justin Trudeau's "unique selling proposition to inspire a favourable connection with new supporters" (Marland, 2013, p. 9). Second, Marland (2013) argues that Justin mimics his father's image through emphasis on nationalism: "in visual communication Justin is often positioned near a Canadian flag and its red/white colours, he promotes a message of Canadian multiculturalism" (p. 10). Last, Justin also reflects a celebrity status, a concept I will elaborate on with Street's (2004) research. Marland argues Justin is a "humble celebrity who loves Canada," but his

  

11  

personal life and some of its luxurious details are often detailed in Canadian media in between celebrity gossip or tabloid headlines (p. 10-12). Overall, Marland (2013) suggests that Justin's brand management and the "celebrity treatment of a politician" can serve as a case study and encourage the public's interest in politics, specifically youth voters (p. 13).

Public  Perceptions  of  Politicians  in  Images        Rosenberg et. al. (1986) conducted multiple studies about the impact physical appearance has on voter preference. For their research, the images were portraits of Caucasian, male electoral candidates, with the photograph shot from the chest up. In the results, Rosenberg et. al. (1986) concluded that a candidate's appearance had a "significant impact on electoral outcomes" and that "this is true even when the candidate's appearance is presented only through the medium of a photograph on a campaign flyer" (p. 121-123). This is based on physical appearance only, but the authors suggest appearance is a marker for the candidates' personal qualities (p. 123). Rosenberg and McCafferty (1987) furthered this research to see if different photographs of the same man influence perceptions if the man is posing differently. This includes a change in facial expression and looking straight ahead or standing off-centre (p. 35). The "relatively minor changes in photographic presentation, a different camera angle or the addition of a slight smile," they argue, can affect how a politician is received (Rosenberg and McCafferty, 1987, p. 37). Ultimately, they suggest, "different photographs of the same candidate provide voters with different images of that candidate's character and fitness

  

12  

for office and this, in turn, importantly influences their electoral choices" (Rosenberg and McCafferty, 1987, p. 42). Brown et. al. (1988) and Guzmán and Sierra (2009) separately developed typologies to research what political leadership qualities resonated with survey participants. Brown et. al. (1988) studied Canadian leaders' images where their typology included competence, dynamism, integrity, empathy, responsibility, personal style, political skills, episodic judgements, social background attributes, party references, political positions, and an unclassified typology (p. 727-734). They concluded that Canadians were consistent and respondents were "generally preoccupied with the personal attributes of political leaders at the expense of the leaders' socio-political attributes" (p. 739). More importantly, their research showed that respondents envisioned a "prototypical leader role" that remained consistent in between elections, even with turnover in leadership (Brown et. al., 1988, p. 753).1 Guzmán and Sierra's (2009) research looked for the gap between political marketing and candidate brand. It included a total of 67 typologies, but the authors used ten categories before creating subcategories. These ten categories include sincerity, excitement, competence, sophistication, ruggedness, energy, agreeable, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness (Guzmán and Sierra, 2009, p. 211). Their results reflect "candidates are primarily evaluated according to how capable they seem to be, and that this capability is described by the level of perceived competence ­ political, managerial and leadership ­ and energy of the candidate" (p. 215). Competence

In a separate study based on Jordanian elections, Alsamydai and Khasawneh's (2013) research emphasizes credibility, defined as "the sum total of the voting public's perception of that individual's competence, goodwill, and trustworthiness" (p. 109). While credibility was deemed the most important component, similar to Brown et. al. (1988), personal attributes were ranked as the second most important (p. 122).

  

13  

was defined by the subcategories of hardworking, intelligent, leader, successful, constant, and responsible, whereas energy was defined by the subcategories of dynamic, energetic, and enterprising. Guzmán and Sierra's codebook was defined by Aaker's (1997) brand personality scale and Caprara et al.'s (2002) candidate personality scale.

Politicians  on  Social  Media        While the literature does not directly link to Instagram, one social media strategy is authenticity, but like branding, it is a contested term. For this reason, authenticity will not be added to the codebook described later in this MRP. Gaden and Dumitrica (2015) argue that authenticity is the "buzzword," especially with social media integrated into the general public's daily lives so well (para. 1).2 Politicians are advised to "demonstrate their authenticity" through updated social media platforms with "informal (non-political)" details like hobbies and interests to "avoid the perception of insincerity" (Grow and Ward, 2013, para. 58). This is similar to the Chrétien strategy (Delacourt, 2013) or the research of Brown et. al. (1988), Guzmán and Sierra (2009), and Alsamydai and Khasawneh (2013). Over time, the strategies have not changed dramatically. Instead the platforms have shifted to social media and mobile applications like Instagram and others like it. The 2008 and 2012 electoral campaigns for Barack Obama "made social media the `prodigy' medium that journalists, pundits, and perhaps, to a less extent, citizens at large come to associate with a successful, honest and engaged electoral candidate" (Gaden and Dumitrica, 2015, para. 19). In a similar strategy based on authenticity, Calgary's Naheed

Ironically, authenticity was once associated directly with political engagement, instead of online portrayal (Gaden and Dumitrica, 2015, para. 3).

Nenshi wanted to "hit people where they live," and he directly communicated with supporters and critics through social media during his 2010 mayoral campaign (Wingrove, 2010). But to further the sense of authenticity, his campaign team emphasized it was only Nenshi writing the postings on his Twitter and Facebook accounts (Gaden and Dumitrica, 2015). Grow and Ward (2013) argue that on social media, "authority is demonstrated via information about the candidate's credentials and via the candidate's technological savvy-ness" (para. 32). For example, a lack of biographical information on a Facebook page was interpreted as the candidate not understanding how to use Facebook (Grow and Ward, 2013). Furthermore, Grow and Ward (2013) suggest that a "candidate with a higher level of tech savvy-ness was perceived as having more authority, but also as being more willing to engage with their constituents, connecting authority and engagement" (para. 35). Lastly, the literature suggests there is a rising trend in the crossover between celebrity and politician. The phenomenon is called "celebrity politics" and Street (2004) looks at politicians who gain celebrity status and celebrities who gain political status. For the purpose of this pilot study, I will only focus on the former because the latter does not apply to the data collection. Celebrity politicians are elected politicians or nominated candidates who use "associations of the celebrity to enhance their image" or exploit "nontraditional platforms or formats" for promotion in the political sphere (Street, 2004, p. 437-438). Based on the use of social media, politicians today attempt to obtain celebrity status through the many platforms available. Ekman and Widholm (2014) add to this performance aspect and the rise of politics becoming "celebritised" via Twitter (p. 518). They argue this online performance creates "public connectivity" through a personal,

  

15  

online relationship between the politician and their followers (Ekman and Widholm, 2014, p. 519). This relationship is further solidified when traditional media outlets use the online images from these accounts. Ekman and Widholm (2014) call it an "infinite helix of self-mediation and news media attention" (p. 519). The research and case studies so far highlight social media use in the political sphere as necessary and effective, but little research reflects how politicians specifically use Instagram. In 2013, Instagram hired a political outreach manager to "manage and execute relationships with governments, politicians and political influencers on how to best use Instagram" (Delo, 2013). Similarly, McNely (2012) argues that in using "images to communicate vision... Instagram becomes a crucial mediating genre in the shaping of organizational image-power" (pg. 1). A recent study based on high-ranking Swedish politicians does suggest politicians use similar social media strategies on Instagram, but Instagram is only discussed in one paragraph. In that study, Ekman and Widholm (2015) summarize that politicians use Instagram as "snapshots of their daily life," while projecting on a deeper level that the "political communication is more about the construction of symbolic values, [reflected] in the way politicians portray themselves as `ordinary' hard-working citizens, concerned and dedicated parents, culturally engaged" (p. 82-83). Essentially, this construction returns to Entman's (1993) idea of framing discussed earlier in this literature review. As a whole, the strategies seem to reflect a construction, or framing, of one self for the audience to interpret in a specific way. To summarize, the literature demonstrates that scholars have been studying politicians' brand and image maintenance strategies for several decades. The studies show a debate over audiences' needs and values, as well as scholars' definitions of

  

16  

certain terms or concepts. However, studies on the sentiment toward politicians' images are limited in the context of new social media platforms. Therefore, this pilot study will combine the topics of brand, image maintenance and social media in order to contribute to the literature in a unique way. Next, I will begin explaining how I intend to achieve this with my research and its methodology.

Methodology  
   Data  Collection        Before outlining my analysis and methods in detail, I will provide a brief introduction to the data collection. As mentioned in my introduction, the data used in this study was collected from Instagram, specifically the official accounts of Harper (@pmstephenharper) and Trudeau (@justinpjtrudeau). The three other major federal party leaders from the New Democratic Party, Green Party, and Bloc Québécois are not included in this dataset because they did not have Instagram accounts during the timeframe of my data collection. To summarize, Instagram is a free online and mobile photo- and video-based social networking platform. On Instagram, users are invited to share pictures and videos both internally and externally through other social networking platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and more. Instagram launched in October 2010 and it was developed by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. In April 2012, Facebook bought Instagram. The platform includes features that are common in other social media platforms, like hashtags, but also hosts unique customizable features like filters. The name, Instagram, is a portmanteau of "instant camera" and "telegram," which hints at its Polaroid-meets-digital esthetics (Instagram, 2015). The platform allows users to follow other users, but it does not require mutual agreement like a Facebook friend request. Today, Instagram is the most downloaded and most used photo social platform. In December 2014, Instagram announced that it has 300 million active users per month

  

18  

(Instagram, 2014). Furthermore, statistics show that engagement on Instagram is fifteen times that of Facebook's engagement (Truong, 2014). In order to find data on user preferences, this pilot study will focus exclusively on users' engagement through the "like" function on Instagram. At the time of collecting my data and writing this MRP, the accounts were public and allowed access to the "likes" given to each posting. I did not collect any information identifying the followers or participants. Because of this, my research is exempt from the Research Ethics Board review.3 This data does have limitations. While tracking "likes" on Instagram may not always correlate to a user's values, it is assumed that by engaging with an image from a politician on this platform, the user does "like" or value the image and what it represents. Furthermore, at the time of collection, there was no way to use demographics to provide a more detailed profile of who prefers the images and their values. Similarly, I recognize that there may be self-selection bias by who follows the politicians based on the users' ideologies, interests, or general preferences. However, it can be hypothesized that users with an interest in the Conservative Party or conservative ideology may follow Harper's account and not Trudeau's account and vice versa. Trolling, or online harassment, is also very common in the photos' comments. For this reason, and to meet the scope of this MRP, I will exclude comments from my data selection and focus on the value of image "likes."

Ryerson University's Research Ethics Board (2015) states that if "a project involves humans in any way (e.g. administering a survey, observing or interviewing participants, organizing focus groups, social or media experimentation, etc.) then your project is subject to ethical review."

  

19  

Lastly, I recognize that mobile app use and social media platform use tends to be dominated by specific demographics. According to a PEW Report published in January 2015, Instagram's demographic tends to be young adults between 18 and 29 years of age. Notably, it is the only social media platform with extensive growth from all demographics (Duggan et. al., 2015). While users can only post via smart phones and tablets, users can "like" images from smart phones, tablets and desktop or laptop computers. This functionality mitigates some accessibility bias. Because of both demographics and accessibility, the data in this pilot study has some limitations and might perhaps reflect a younger demographic with certain socio-economic privileges to access the Instagram platform. I recognize that socio-economical privileges may have an influence on preferred political values. Having outlined Instagram and its usability, I will now summarize how I narrowed down my data collection to the 100 images pulled from Harper and Trudeau's Instagram accounts. Since joining in April 2013, Harper has posted 268 photos as of May 1, 2015. Trudeau joined in December 2012 and has since posted 194 times. To use the most relevant photos, I chose to limit my data to only include Instagram postings between April 1, 2014 and March 31, 2015. Because Harper posts more often than Trudeau, I wanted to ensure their separate data collections were equal in number. Because of this, I tracked and quantified the twenty-five most liked and twenty-five least liked images from both accounts to have a total of one hundred images to analyze. To narrow my data collection, I manually counted the received likes for images posted between April 1, 2014 and March 31, 2015 and determined their popularity. The images that did not rank in the top or bottom twenty-five most liked postings were eliminated from consideration.

  

20  

Because Trudeau posts to Instagram with less frequency than Harper, fewer photos were eliminated from consideration for Trudeau's data collection. Once my data collection was focused, I conducted a visual content analysis in the framework of visual social semiotics to look for themes, values and ideologies. The details of this analysis can be found in the appendix. One of Trudeau's least liked posting from the past year feature him and his children at the Calgary Stampede, but it is a 15-second video instead of a photo. I excluded this posting because it is a video and I wanted my data collection to include only still images in order to be consistent.

Codebook      The codes I used for my analysis were developed from my literature review, primarily from the works of Street (2004), Brown et. al. (1988), Guzmán and Sierra (2009) and Alsamydai and Khasawneh (2013). Their separate works focused on public responses to politicians in the context of public events or through traditional media. Their research did not include social media or online platforms, so this pilot study will test if their most valued attributes translate to a new digital and social platform. I specifically chose to combine the works of Brown et. al. (1988), Guzmán and Sierra (2009) and Alsamydai and Khasawneh (2013) because they tend to use overlapping terms like competence and empathy. Some of the codes, like symbols of nationalism and community outreach are outside the literature review and reflect the current Canadian political environment. Their additions are based on my early findings when I analyzed a random selection of photos to test my codebook. In my practice analysis, I noticed images

  

21  

reflecting Canadian symbols, like maple leaves or the Canadian flag. I also added community outreach because my test analysis reflected multiple photos where both Trudeau and Harper are meeting with members of Canadian communities. Because the 2015 election date has not been called during the time of this study, I could not label this action as campaigning, but I still wanted to highlight their engagement with the different communities. Finally, to address any possible gaps, the codebook also has a miscellaneous category. This codebook, along with definitions and examples, can be found in Table 1.    Method  of  Analysis        Having outlined the data collection and codebook, I will now summarize how I analyzed the information. After narrowing my data collection to 100 images, I performed a visual content analysis and transcribed my findings into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. All nine codes in the codebook were applied to the images while performing the visual content analysis. Kress and van Leeuwen's (2006) visual social semiotics theory guided the coding strategy. Through their metafunctions explaining vectors, framing, colour use, and symbol use, I categorized the 100 images. Please see Appendices B, C, E and F for detailed tables of my analysis.                                     22

Findings  and  Analysis    
The method I applied to my data collection highlighted trends that are specific to the strategies implemented by Harper and Trudeau. In my analysis, I will begin by answering the first and second research questions and separately highlight the different themes present in Harper and Trudeau's accounts. Next, I will answer the final research question by identifying the key strategies implemented and what this reveals about them as politicians. Finally, I will apply my findings to the theoretical framework before offering concluding thoughts.4

What  qualities  do  the  followers  like  from  @justinpjtrudeau?          For  Justin  Trudeau's  data  set,  his  followers  like  images  from  Trudeau's   personal  life.  The  personal  category  was  coded  13  times.  The  other  most-liked   images  were  coded  as  community  outreach  (4),  competence  (3),  and  ideology  (2).  In   this  section  of  my  MRP,  I  will  describe  these  categories  and  the  themes  that  emerged   in  more  detail.   Out of the twenty-five most liked photos from Trudeau's dataset, I coded thirteen of them as personal for highlighting Trudeau's life outside of his role as a politician. For the most part, these images showcase his family life with his wife, Sophie Grégoire and their three children. In some instances, which the audience responded to positively, Trudeau's postings blur the line between his role as a politician and father.5 Whether the

images are set outside of work or not, these results suggest Trudeau's openness in his professional and personal roles. These images give a human quality to Trudeau and give him the opportunity to show positive paternal qualities. However, this openness, when it crosses over into his political life, also adds to Trudeau's celebrity status. For example, Grégoire is often found at his side in photos that feature Trudeau campaigning or working. Marland (2013) describes Grégoire, as someone in the public domain and with celebrity status (p. 11), so her capital and influence on Trudeau's brand likely resonates with the followers. By showing Grégoire in both home and work settings, these images add to Trudeau's brand and provide more opportunity for moments of openness. Overall, the diversity in Trudeau's personal photos provide a narrative structure for his followers to interpret and seek qualities that could translate into leadership qualities. On a related note, some of Trudeau's personal images allude to his childhood and most often, these images include his father and former prime minister, Pierre Trudeau. As highlighted in my literature review, Marland's (2013) work suggests that Justin Trudeau is trying to leverage parts of his father's brand with his own. Essentially, the Trudeau "dynasty" is where Justin is an extension of his father's brand and he tries to selectively reflect the parent's brand (Marland, 2013, p. 9). By referencing Pierre Trudeau in images, there is a visual reminder of "Trudeaumania" and the Liberal Party's peak in the late 1960s and 1970s.6 The high amount of likes for these images suggests that Justin Trudeau's followers on Instagram like the political legacy the Trudeau name and image evokes. In Trudeau's data set, I did not categorize many of the images under symbols of nationalism, but many of the images did reflect it, just not overtly. Trudeau is often seen

wearing red and white and this is likely done to reflect Liberal branding. These colours are also seen with the Canadian flag or a hockey jersey. This is consistent with Marland's (2013) findings where he notes Trudeau is "often positioned near a Canadian flag and its red and white colours" (p. 10). While the red and white usage is common during Liberal events, the colour is also present in photos were Trudeau is engaging with the community. This finding may suggest that in future studies, a subcategory may need to be added to reflect nationalism as a secondary value. Next, Trudeau is often photographed with various Liberal Party figures from the both the provincial and federal level. I categorized these images under the code, ideology. Similar to evoking his father, one of Trudeau's most liked photos is with former Prime Minister, Jean Chrétien. Since Chrétien was a part of the senior Trudeau's cabinet throughout his time as prime minister, Chrétien posing with the younger Trudeau evokes memories of the federal Liberal Party's peak and the height of "Trudeaumania." This is a similar tactic to posting images from Trudeau's childhood. Another successful example of this is a photo of Trudeau with Ontario's Premier-elect, Kathleen Wynne, right after her victory in the last provincial election. By posing with such prominent Liberal figures, Trudeau is aligning with the Liberal Party's ideology and reminding his followers of the political partnerships he shares. Trudeau also posted images with other elected Liberals in their ridings. While it highlights party unity, if the candidate or Liberal figure is not wellknown, the posting does not receive a lot of likes. This value only seems to garner likes if the politician Trudeau poses with has a recognizable status in the political sphere, much like Chrétien or Wynne.

  

26  

Overall, with Trudeau's findings, it shows that his Instagram followers prefer personal photos that offer glimpses of the Trudeau family behind the scenes. Using Kress and van Leeuwen's (2006) theoretical framework, there is a vectoral pattern that constructs a narrative for Trudeau's visual branding. His most liked photos feature him interacting with his family in the role of husband and father. Through repetitive vectors, Kress and van Leeuwen (2006) argue these patterns "serve to present unfolding actions and events, processes of changes, transitory spatial arrangements" (p. 59). With Trudeau and his family, the vectors in this data collection show a close intimacy within the family and in different spaces. This is shown through some photos of Trudeau bringing his children to work or Grégoire campaigning beside Trudeau. In the majority of the personal photos, there are few photos where the Trudeaus look directly "at" the followers on Instagram. Because they are not inviting the viewers in with a gaze, it adds to the "behind the scenes" value and provides a glimpse into Trudeau's personal life.

What  qualities  do  the  followers  dislike  from  @justinpjtrudeau?        Trudeau's followers dislike images where Trudeau is working or engaging with people. I coded twelve images under the community outreach category and six images under the competence category. This is an interesting result because these categories are also popular in Trudeau's most liked images. In all of these images, Trudeau tends to be working, but it does not necessarily translate as a negative quality for Trudeau to campaign, work, or engage with the community. Instead, most of the posted images feature long shots of Trudeau, often among a crowd of people.7 Because Trudeau's followers valued community outreach and competence in his most liked images, the disliked images may be disliked for their composition and not necessarily because of their value. Kress and van Leeuwen (2006) theorize that long, full body shots tend to be impersonal (p. 148). This seems slightly contradictory since the disliked photos feature Trudeau engaging with the public, but from the perspective of Instagram users, they see Trudeau from too far away. Trudeau is also often lost in the crowd in this collection of images. This also reflects the theory. Kress and van Leeuwen (2006) believe that the focus of an image needs strong framing in order to be seen as a distinct participant in an image (p. 203) In the most liked photos, the composition was more clear and focused on Trudeau. This pilot study's objective was to use Kress and van Leeuwen's theory to guide the categorization of the images in my data collection. However, the results of this research question suggest that key components of the theory ­ such as composition ­ are important as well. The results further suggest that strong photographs and the values they

represent are not mutually exclusive. Rather, there is a prioritization of image composition over value.

What  qualities  do  the  followers  like  from  @pmstephenharper?        Unlike Trudeau, in his most liked photos, Harper's account did not have a value that was overwhelmingly more popular than the rest. Instead, his followers valued competence (6), celebrity (5), empathy (4), and community outreach (3) the most. In this section, using the Harper data collection, I will answer my first research question and discuss the categories and the themes that emerged from these categorizations. Harper's most liked images reflect his role as the prime minister. The categories competence and community outreach relate to Harper working in some capacity and performing in this role. These images show him talking with people in the community, behind the podium, on the phone, or at an event. If he is not speaking, he is with a prominent international or celebrity figure.8 As a prime minister, Harper has ample opportunity to speak or meet with members of the public, political colleagues and international figures, celebrities, and more. Because of this, he is able to document these interactions. This suggests that Harper's followers like seeing his role as a prime minister documented. Furthermore, many of the images from these categories have similar vectors. For example, in Figure 5, the vector is created with eye contact and a handshake between Harper and German Chancellor, Angela Merkel. In Figure 6, Harper creates the same vector with Bill Gates. This vectoral narrative is simple and repetitive throughout Harper's data collection and it creates consistency in his account. This reflects Marland's

(2012) findings, where a Conservative insider stated that most of Harper's photos were "pro forma, things you just do as a [prime minister]" (p. 222-223). As discussed in my literature review, Harper has been critiqued for not expressing empathy. Because of this, it is notable that four images from his most liked data collection were categorized under the empathy value. These photos are from major events in the past year: the funeral following the attack on Parliament in October 2014; the funeral of his friend and colleague, Jim Flaherty; and Remembrance Day on November 11, 2014.9 Westen (2008) writes that the political brain is an emotional brain, and because of this, civilians cannot look at politics without an emotional lens (pg. xv). This commentary is important following the attack on Parliament. The news coverage did reflect a country both in a state of shock and grief (CBC News, 2014; Carlson and Mackrael, 2014). The high value in the photos following the Ottawa shooting could be a response of shared grief and empathy between Harper and his followers. These moments of grief are important for Harper's image following the critiques. Similar to Trudeau, Harper uses his wife, Laureen Harper, for image maintenance. However, unlike Trudeau, Harper's wife is only present for the photos categorized under empathy or competence. Laureen's role seems more ceremonial in this context, and as mentioned in the literature review, she is often accredited with softening his image. She is present in three of the four empathy photos. This seems strategic and relevant to maintaining Harper's brand and image because her presence is limited in the data collection. Notably, in the background of the photos categorized as competence, celebrity, or empathy, there tends to be symbols of nationalism present, although very few images

were coded under the symbols of nationalism category. I coded postings as symbols of nationalism only if the Canadian nationalism seemed to be at the forefront of the image. An example of this is found in Harper's most liked image, where Harper wears a Canadian hockey jersey and celebrates with others dressed like him.10 In the other images, notably dealing with empathy, Canadian flags, pins, and other accessories are present as ceremonial accessories for the event taking place. Similarly, the same objects are present in meetings and events with international figures. These symbols are strategic, as Marland (2012) describes how Harper uses Canadian flags as "props to suggest patriotism and statesmanship" (p. 222). This undertone is not enough to categorize the postings as symbols of nationalism, but as discussed in Trudeau's data collection, in future studies, the codebook could reflect it as a subcategory as well.

What  qualities  do  the  followers  dislike  from  @pmstephenharper?      Harper's least liked photos reflected similar results to his most liked photos. However, for Harper's data collection, a majority of the least liked photos were categorized as competence (14) and community outreach (7), with only four postings coded as one of the seven other categories. These findings reflect Trudeau's data collection as well. The vectoral narrative does not deviate from Harper's most liked photos, although, some of the photos show Harper from a distance or in a weak frame. This similarity to Trudeau's data collection suggests the composition of the photo is why followers may like the other postings more. This reflects Rosenberg and McCafferty's (1987) findings where "relatively minor changes" in the photo could influence how a politician is interpreted (p. 37). Because some of the images have a weak composition, the disliked photos may have received their ranking because of Kress and van Leeuwen's (2006) metafunctions. However, because the vectoral narrative does not deviate, the context of the image may be an influence on Harper's followers. For example, an image of Harper and Merkel11 was well liked, but similar images featuring Harper and Donald Tusk, Prime Minister of Poland, or Harper and Australia's Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, were disliked. Similarly, an image of Harper and Bill Gates meeting was well liked,12 but multiple images where they are conversing at a conference in support of women and children were disliked. This suggests the likeability of the image is influenced by the political context or the followers' knowledge or opinion on the policy or person depicted in the posting.

What  do  these  qualities  reveal  about  the  political  actors  in  my  data   collection?          Overall, Harper and Trudeau's accounts align with their respective brand strategies. Unfortunately, there is limited literature on Harper and Trudeau in this context, but Marland's (2012, 2013) research on the politicians is consistent with my findings. In short, for Harper, his Instagram strategy is very literal and simple. The platform serves as a snapshot of his day-to-day life only as the Prime Minister of Canada. In contrast, Trudeau's account provides some depth and relationship between Trudeau and the other participants in the postings because of compositional details like framing and the kinds of vectors Trudeau shares with the other participants. While there were some similarities in my results between the two accounts, it is these differences that really highlight the tone of their respective strategies. Both Harper and Trudeau's followers disliked the images that reflect values like community outreach and competence. For the most part, these were images where the politicians were working or campaigning in their respective roles. Notably, as highlighted in discussing my second research question, the reasons why the followers did not prefer these images varies between the two accounts. For Trudeau, this suggests that his image strategy needs to avoid disconnect and instead, follow the more intimate composition of his well-liked images. Unfortunately, in Harper's data collection of less preferred images, their likeability may have been determined by context or opinion. For Trudeau's most liked images, the findings revealed qualities that are both consistent with his criticisms and with qualities that his fans like. As discussed in answering my first research question, there is a celebrity quality to Trudeau's image that is emphasized with the personal behind-the-scenes glimpses of his family life. This

  

33  

celebrity status is further emphasized with articles about the birth of his children or his haircuts in both political and non-political publications (Marland, 2013, p. 12). While the account highlights his work in the political sphere, it is not translating as strongly as the non-political aspects of Trudeau's life. This strategy is consistent with findings from more recent studies from Ekham and Widholm (2014, 2015), Grow and Ward (2013), and Gaden and Dumitrica (2015). Both Grow and Ward (2013) and Gaden and Dumitrica (2015) highlight authenticity as an important component in a popular social media account. For Trudeau, this authenticity may include the more human moments as a politician, father, and husband. Ekham and Widholm (2015) briefly elaborate on similar findings in their own study. They state Instagram is used to highlight the day-to-day, and to show politicians as "ordinary citizens," and this includes the task of parenting (p. 8283). Much like Chrétien wore a denim shirt to present himself as an everyday man, Trudeau uses Instagram to show himself both engaged with the public and an everyday citizen who happens to work in the political sphere. For Harper, the findings suggest he uses Instagram as a professional tool and not as a personal tool. As mentioned above, social media is meant to show authenticity with "informal details" outside of politics (Grow and Ward, 2013, para. 58), but the data suggests Harper uses it to provide some insight to his day-to-day life as the Prime Minister of Canada. This deviates from Marland's (2012) research because Harper's life is not presented as relatable to the common Canadian, despite the occasional photo of Harper at a hockey game or enjoying some ice cream. The snapshots of his daily life emphasize his leadership position and because of it, he is given ample opportunity to be seen on the international platform as Canada's representative. His policies also influence

  

34  

the content, as he is often seen speaking behind a podium that suggests he is talking about jobs, crime, or other initiatives. This suggests he uses Instagram to reach more people about government action and perhaps to indirectly inform his followers on policies. This strategy is likely intentional. If Harper were to run for re-election in the upcoming election, the only images associated with him would be as a prime minister. In summary, the results of this study suggest that there are specific but different strategies in place for Instagram and image maintenance. Even though the results of the second research question were nearly identical for the two data sets, the reasons behind them vary and reflect different strategies from the politicians. Notably, these strategies reflect the current literature. Next, I will summarize what these strategies mean in the context of visual social semiotics.    Connection  to  Visual  Social  Semiotics        Throughout my analysis, I applied Kress and van Leeuwen's (2006) ideational, interpersonal, and textual metafunctions to my data collection. Specifically, identifying vectors and framing techniques was very important in both discussing the photo's composition and coding it for values. For Trudeau's findings in particular, the audience likes images where Trudeau is very visible, and likely shot in close range. For Harper, the vectors in the ideational metafunction are very important in emphasizing his engagement while working in the community or meeting on an international level. Most importantly, similar vectoral patterns are either liked or disliked by the audience regardless of the account the users follow. A notable difference between the two accounts in this data collection is the kinds of vectors Trudeau and Harper perform with the participants. Harper's vectors tend to be

  

35  

static, whereas Trudeau's vectors are more active. Often, Harper is behind a podium or shaking hands with another participant and these vectors are consistent in both his least liked and most liked images.13 In comparison, many of Trudeau's images show Trudeau in motion.14 But even in similar vectoral structure, Trudeau is more likely to be photographed shaking a hand from an oblique angle or foregoing the gesture for an embrace or a pat on the back.15 The variety in Trudeau's postings reflects Rosenberg and McCafferty's (1987) research where image diversity influences the public's opinion on how a politician is received (p. 37). This difference further suggests that a strong vectoral narrative is a necessary tool in image maintenance and branding. My findings complement Kress and van Leeuwen's work because it tested their metafunctions on a visual social media platform. While it does not devalue the work of Street (2004), Brown et. al. (1988), Guzmán and Sierra (2009) and Alsamydai and Khasawneh (2013), visual social semiotics is a key tool for finding the values. Overall, I found the metafunctions served as an important indicator of the photo's likeability, especially when the photo was ranked low on the scale. The results suggest that visual social semiotics is very important in constructing visual narratives. In particular, the results from Trudeau's data collection emphasize the importance of the metafunction in constructing a narrative. If Trudeau's objective is to show human connection and a sense of inclusion in his Instagram postings, then the composition of the postings needs to reflect this. The purpose of semiotics is to explore how signs are used to construct communities, and this includes values. Without identifying Kress and van Leeuwen's metafunctions, the values discussed in my codebook do not have a method for expression.

Having answered my research questions and highlighted my contribution to visual social semiotics, I will next offer suggestions for further studies and concluding thoughts on this pilot study.

Conclusion  
The aim of this pilot study was to update the public's perceptions of politicians on a new digital media platform. Using my literature review to highlight audience values in the past, I created a codebook to test these values on Instagram. Following my analysis, the findings of this pilot study reflect my literature review: Instagram users tend to like politicians that exhibit competence, but also highlight their personal life. The findings also reflect the importance and longevity of Kress and van Leeuwen's (2006) visual social semiotics, and the theory was reapplied to a new context. Overall, it seems that the image's metafunctions are very important to the audience on Instagram and Kress and van Leeuwen's theory was successfully translated to the image-based social media platform. However, the results did have some anomalies that suggest further research may be needed. In particular, with Harper's data collection, his audience seems to both like and dislike the prime minister displaying competence. This raises the question of whether the codebook needs to include subcategories, as I alluded to earlier in my findings. There are some limitations to this pilot study. First, the response and opinions of policy may influence likeability. For example, Harper's least liked image featured Harper discussing the Victims Bill of Rights and legal experts and the general public criticized it (Perkel, 2014). While it was outside the scope of this study, public opinion could be considered in evaluating image in this context. Second, the results of this research paper also suggest that text should be included in future studies and the research should be guided through a multimodal lens. I recommend this because some of the least liked    38  

images included captions that provided limited context or guidance for the followers. This was most evident in Trudeau's least liked images. For example, in Figure 12, the posting was captioned as "#cdnpoli #lpc #trinspa #topoli". The hashtags provided limited context, but Figure 12 suggests Trudeau is in an interview setting. The importance of context and well-written captions differ from Trudeau's most liked images, where the captions are written in both English and French and the hashtags are incorporated into the sentence structure. While this pilot study focused on visual social semiotics, one limitation was the exclusion of text, and subsequently, the caption that provides the context. This limitation may provide another reason as to why similar values ­ specifically community outreach or competence ­ were both liked and disliked. Ultimately, the results of this pilot study suggest the need for further research with a closer focus on caption, context, media commentary, and public opinion.

Until further studies can be conducted, this pilot study can serve as a relevant document to professional communicators and how they can construct a persuasive image and story in the political context and on a social media platform. The images on the @pmstephenharper and @justinpjtrudeau accounts reflect distinct strategies that are unique to their respective brands as politicians. The communicated images reflect idealized qualities of everyday Canadians in uncommon situations and the variety of images highlight the struggles for a politician to seem competent, yet relatable. This pilot study is relevant to how professional communicators can construct a politician's narrative and visual story to persuade a mass audience in an online space like Instagram. But as social media and new digital platforms develop and evolve, political brand and image maintenance will change as well. In the end, as with most things in the political realm, it appears the public's values will still be an important feature in constructing a successful image and brand for a politician.

Appendix  B:  Interpretation  of  Trudeau's   Most  Liked  Photos    
Figure 1 Component Content Vectors Observations Trudeau is performing the "Live Long and Prosper" gesture from Star Trek. He is not smiling. He is dressed in a suit and his hand is in the foreground. Trudeau is the only participant. He is communicating with the followers through the direct eye contact. The gaze looking into the camera (and consequently, the followers) is a demand and it creates a vector between the participant and viewer. The close shot of the image suggests intimacy. The eye level and front-facing angles suggest equality and engagement. The depth of the photo focuses the viewer on the gesture first, making it the most important aspect of the image. It is slightly illuminated in comparison to the darker background. The hand is placed on the left and in the foreground so it is well emphasized. For salience, the hand is very large and further emphasized.

Figure 2 Component Content Observations Trudeau and Chrétien are smiling and waving in front of the Canadian flag and a crowd of people. The image was posted on February 15, 2015, Flag Day, which suggests this was at an event or celebration for the day. There are multiple participants in the image: Trudeau, Chrétien, the crowd of people, and the Canadian flag. There are also multiple vectors. Most importantly, the connection between Trudeau and Chrétien shows friendship. The crowds clapping gesture or waving of the Canadian flag shows celebration. Trudeau and Chrétien are not making eye contact with the camera, but with something in the distance, which suggests an audience off-camera. 50

Distance and Angles Colour, Brightness, Illumination and Saturation Composition

The photo is taken from a distance, which suggests it is impersonal and the angles suggest power and detachment. There is a heavy use of red and white colours: the flag, the ties worn by Chrétien and Trudeau and the outfits worn by the crowd. There appears to be a filter applied to the image, an Instagram feature, which I believe increases the saturation of the red colour. The Canadian flag, Chrétien and Trudeau are all centered in the image. Notably, Chrétien and Trudeau's arms mimic the shape of the maple leaf. While Chrétien, Trudeau and the flag are in focus, the crowd is not. The photo was edited to create a blocked frame on the top and bottom of the photo.

Figure 3 Component Content Vectors Observations The photo was posted on Remembrance Day, November 11, 2014. Trudeau is laying a wreath down on the ground while a soldier is nearby. There are three participants: Trudeau, the soldier and the wreath. The wreath and soldier are symbolic, ceremonial pieces representing a moment of grief. Trudeau is also a participant depicting the empathy through the vector and gaze with the wreath. The medium shot suggests it is a social photo. The lower angle suggests the participants have the power in the image. The image is dark in colour, with natural light adding brightness to all three participants. The composition is very low to the ground and the framing is also low so the viewer's eyes may be attracted to the wreath, especially with the soldier's gaze pointing downward.

Figure 4 Component Content Vectors Observations A young Trudeau in a pose that is traditionally associated with school portraits. The participant is a young Trudeau. The vector is the eye contact, which is straight ahead at the camera and 51

viewer of the image. The distance is minimal and personal, but still professional. The angle is straight ahead and suggests equality and involvement. There appears to be minimal manipulation with colour, brightness, illumination and saturation. The photo appears slightly dated with some fading and specks. The framing is very professional and traditional to the portrait photography.

Figure 5 Component Content Observations A man (assumed to be Trudeau, based on the appearance of the back of his head) and Kathleen Wynne are hugging. There is a crowd in the background, smiling and taking photos. The participants are Trudeau, Wynne and the crowd. The vector between Wynne and Trudeau shows friendship and familiarity. The crowd's vectors (watching, smiling and taking photos) suggest there is a celebration. The close shot suggests it is a personal moment for Wynne and Trudeau. There are a lot of red hues in the image, which suggests this is a Liberal function. Wynne and Trudeau are brighter in the image than the crowd, focusing the viewer's attention on them. Trudeau and Wynne are also the center of the image, which further adds focus to their embrace.

Figure 6 Component Content Vectors Distance and Angles Colour, Brightness, Illumination and Saturation    Observations Trudeau is smiling and holding a wrapped box. There is a Christmas tree in the background. Trudeau is the only participant. His gaze is at the camera and viewers. There is a vector with the wrapped box. The medium shot and front angle suggests this is a social image. The red hues, combined with the setting, further emphasize the Christmas season. There appears to be a filter on the image to give it a more golden saturation. 52  

Composition

Trudeau is slightly off centered. The different plants and the Christmas tree frame him on either side.

Figure 7 Component Content Vectors Observations Trudeau, his wife, and their child are smiling at the camera. The child is dressed like Santa Claus. Trudeau, his wife and his child are the three participants. Their eye contact is straight toward the camera and their close body language creates a vector that suggests intimacy. The close angle makes the photo very personal and the levelled angle suggests equality and an invitation into the personal space. There is a grainy texture to the image, which suggests a filter or saturation of some sort. Notably, Trudeau and his wife are wearing similar colours that compliment the child's red Santa outfit. The framing of the parents around the child creates symmetry. It is furthered emphasize by colour (see above).

Figure 8 Component Content Vectors Observations Pierre Trudeau carrying a baby on his back. It is assumed Justin Trudeau is that baby. Pierre and Justin are the participants. Justin strapped to Pierre's back suggests a relationship between child and parent. Pierre's gaze to Justin also suggests this relationship. The medium distance suggests this is a social photo and the angle is front-facing and suggests equality. There appears to be a blur at the top and bottom of the photo. There is a dated appearance to the image with a fade and no saturation, but it is hard to tell if this is from the print or editing tools on Instagram. Both Trudeaus are at the center of the image and are placed in the bottom two-thirds of the photo. There is slight framing on the right with trees.

Image 9 Component Content Vectors Distance and Angles Colour, Brightness, Illumination and Saturation Composition Observations Trudeau is dressed in a suit and on an airplane in the dark. He is reading some papers and has a pen in his hand. Trudeau's gaze and vector with the pen and paper suggests he is working on the plane. Trudeau and the pen and paper are the participants. The long distance suggests it is impersonal. The darkness juxtaposes with the light illuminating his workspace. The focus in on Trudeau working. The rows of chairs create some guidance towards the off-centered Trudeau. The photo was edited to create a blocked frame on the top and bottom of the photo.

Figure 10 Component Content Vectors Observations Trudeau, his wife, and two of his children are playing on a playground, specifically the swings. The family is the participant, both as individual members and as a collective. Trudeau, his wife and son focus on the play, but his daughter's gaze is on the camera and breaks the vectoral pattern. The vectors suggest a familial bond and moment of happiness. Overall, the distance seems far, which suggests it is an impersonal distance. However, the interaction and inclusion of the full-bodies and vectors juxtapose this. There appears to be a filter on this image via Instagram, perhaps adding saturation. There is brightness from natural light that was perhaps exaggerated through the filter as well. I think father/son and mother/daughter pattern is interesting for the composition. The family is spread across the image, yet still seems close. The photo was edited to create a blocked frame on the top and bottom of the photo.

Figure 11 Component Content Vectors Distance and Angles Colour, Brightness, Illumination and Saturation Composition Observations Trudeau and his son posing and smiling at the camera. Based on the setting, it appears they may be in the House of Commons. Trudeau and his son are the participants. Their gaze is at the camera and the vectors suggest a parent-child relationship. The distance is at a medium length, suggesting it is a social photo. The angle shows equality. The dark background and bright foreground emphasizes the participants in the photo. The dark background is emphasized in the corners, perhaps an Instagram editing option. Trudeau and his son are centered in the photo. The repetitive row of seats adds some framing.

Figure 12 Component Content Vectors Observations Trudeau and two of his children are in a car and smiling. Trudeau is wearing a Montreal Canadiens hockey jersey and his kids appear to be wearing similar red tops. Trudeau and his children are the participants. The gaze with the camera makes the photo personal, and while there are no vectors where the participants are touching, the angled bodies of Trudeau and his daughter suggest closeness. The Montreal Canadiens jersey symbolizes the hockey team and Trudeau's status as a fan. The medium distance and eye-level angle suggest this is a social photo. There seems to be a saturation to emphasize the red colours of the jerseys. The angles of Trudeau's and his daughter's bodies creates some framing. The car's structure also creates some framing. The photo was edited to create a blocked frame on the top and bottom of the photo.

Figure 13A Component Content Vectors Distance and Angles Colour, Brightness, Illumination and Saturation Composition Observations Sophie Grégoire, Trudeau's wife, hugging a man in a suit. The man is hidden behind Sophie's hair and face, but it is assumed it is Trudeau. The participants are Trudeau and Grégoire and their vector and shut eyes suggest intimacy. The distance is close, suggesting a personal moment. The photo is very dark with the background and the clothing worn by the participants. This emphasizes and adds brightness to Grégoire's face and the hands in the embrace. They are centered in the photo so they are the focal point. There are no other participants to add/subtract information value, so the photo really emphasizes their embrace.

Image 13B Component Content Observations Trudeau and three members of the public are dressed warmly in a snowy setting. Trudeau is leaning down and a dog is sniffing his face. The dog is held by one member of the public, as another looks on, and the youngest looks off in the distance and holds a reindeer. Trudeau, the members of the public, and the two animals are all participants. The vector and gaze between the dog and Trudeau is very close and playful. The proximity between Trudeau and the members of the public shows a social engagement. The angle gives the participants power in the photo and the distance suggests it is a social photo. There are cool hues in this photo. This matches the cold setting. Trudeau and the dog are framed by the other people and animals in the photo. They are not as low to the ground as Trudeau and the dog, so their height brings attention to Trudeau.

Image 15 Component Content Vectors Observations Trudeau is sitting in an office, on the phone and holding a pen. Trudeau and the phone are the participants. The phone would represent whoever is on the other side of the phone conversation. Trudeau's gaze down at his desk suggests his focus on the conversation, not the photo being taken. The distant angle shows that the photo is impersonal, but the desk cutting off his lower body shows Trudeau from the waist-up. This suggests an "expert" shot as discussed by Kress and van Leeuwen (2006, p. 126). The muted colours emphasize the office setting. The blurry doorframe or wall in the foreground creates a frame and focuses the image on Trudeau in the background.

Image 16 Component Content Observations Trudeau is dressed in a suit with his son nearby. Across the table, a faceless woman is speaking to a smiling Trudeau. The table is covered in papers, water bottles and glasses. This suggests it might be a professional or work setting. Trudeau, his son, and the women are the participants. The woman is faceless, so she depicts a worker or professional, but she is not easily identifiable. The vector of Trudeau's smile and gaze with the woman shows his focus on the conversation. The image is a medium shot, suggesting a social image, and the angle suggests equality. The image clearly has a filter, making the image unsaturated and only included cream or black colours. The adults on either ends of the table frame the baby. The baby's forward angle is also distinguishing him from the adults' postures and positions in the photo. The photo was edited to create a blocked frame on the top and bottom of the photo.

Image 17A Component Content Vectors Distance and Angles Colour, Brightness, Illumination and Saturation Composition Observations Trudeau dog sledding in a winter setting. Trudeau and the pack of dogs are the participants. The vector is the connection between the dog and Trudeau's sled, indicating some movement. A long distance suggests it is an impersonal photo. The blue hues and brightness in the background emphasize Trudeau and the dogs. The dogs serve as a line leading to Trudeau. His height over the dogs also emphasizes him in the photo even though he is off center.

Image 17B Component Content Vectors Distance and Angles Colour, Brightness, Illumination and Saturation Composition Observations A baby's hand grasps an adult's finger. It is assumed this is one of Trudeau's children grasping Trudeau's finger. The participants are assumed and representative of a parent-child relationship. The touch vector emphasizes that relationship. This is one of the closest shots from Trudeau's entire data set. It shows a very close intimacy. The photo has some yellow hues, but this is likely due to the closeness of the photo's shot and the lack of natural light. The straight lines of the finger and hand meeting focus the viewer's attention on the vector.

Image 19 Component Content Vectors Distance and Angles Colour, Brightness, Illumination and Saturation Composition    Observations Trudeau and Grégoire hug and touch foreheads. Trudeau and Grégoire are the participants. The vectors, through the hug and touching foreheads, suggests intimacy. The close angle suggests this is a personal photo. There is a strong juxtaposition between the bright background and dark clothing worn by Trudeau and Grégoire. It brings the focus to their embrace. Their bodies create a frame that emphasizes the meeting 58  

point (the forehead). Image 20 Component Content Vectors Distance and Angles Colour, Brightness, Illumination and Saturation Composition Observations Trudeau and Grégoire hug and touch foreheads. Trudeau and Grégoire are the representative participants. The vectors, through the hug and foreheads, suggests an intimacy. The medium angle suggests a social photo, but this juxtaposes with the vectors. This photo is mostly in black or grey with limited saturation. It creates a very dramatic feel to the image. Unlike similar photos, the arms add lines that are interwoven and further emphasize intimacy or unity.

Image 21A Component Content Vectors Observations Trudeau, Grégoire and two of their children are on a calm body of water in a canoe. Grégoire and the daughter are waving at an unseen audience. All four members of the family are participants and their gaze is at the camera, the viewers of the image, or the unseen audience in the distance. This suggests an invitation into the photo for those look at the photo through Instagram. The long distance suggests it is an impersonal photo but this is juxtaposed with the gazes and vectors. The bright red and yellow hues stand out against the dark blue water background. The canoe creates a frame. The photo cutting across from the top left corner to bottom right corner suggests movement. The photo was edited to create a blocked frame on the top and bottom of the photo.

they are in an office setting, perhaps a room at Parliament. Notably, the background features photos of former political leaders, including Pierre Trudeau. All three men are participants. The vectors are not direct, but the eye contact and body language suggests a conversation. The low angle suggests the participants hold a position of power. The medium angle makes it a social engagement. The yellow filter dilutes the image and creates little saturation. The two men standing on either side of Trudeau create a frame around him and emphasize his central position.

Image 23 Component Content Observations Trudeau and Brian Gallant are dressed casually in button-up shirts. Trudeau holds Gallant's wrist up in celebration. The background hosts the Canadian flag and a crowd holding signs in red and white (presumably Liberal signs) with different names on them. The foreground shows an audience. There are multiple participants in the image. Trudeau and Gallant are participants who are communicating victory through their vector, smile and gaze toward an audience to their right. The crowd in the background supports this. The flag serves as a participant for symbolizing nationalism. The foreground audience represents members of the public. The medium angle shows a social moment and this is supported through the vectors. The angle suggests equality. The red tone suggests the Liberal Party colours and national colours of Canada's flags. The saturation seems to emphasize the red. The raised arms mimic the shape of the Canadian flag.

Image 24 Component Content Observations The setting is outside and the participants are wearing clothes for physical activity. Trudeau is wearing a marathon bib with his first name, ID number, company names and includes "5K," suggesting this is a run. In the foreground, Trudeau and Rick Hansen are engaging in a conversation. In the background, two men are also engaging in conversation. Trudeau and Hansen are the participants, engaging in conversation and smiling. The vector and gaze between them further emphasizes their relationship and actions. The medium shot suggests this is a social image. Trudeau and Hansen in the foreground emphasize their importance in the image. The red hue in the shirts and bright background suggests some saturation took place to make the image more colourful. Their outstretched arm creates a frame around the vector their eye contact creates.

Image 25 Component Content Observations Trudeau is seen in a crowd, posing with members of the public. He is dressed casually but wearing colourful beaded necklaces. The public is wearing rainbow stickers and there is a rainbow flag in the background. This suggests this is an LGBTQ event, and given the date posting, this suggests it was during a Pride event. Trudeau and the group around him are interactive participants engaging in an event. The crowd behind them are representative and could be assumed as LGBTQ supporters. The medium shot suggests this is a social photo. The angle is from above and suggests viewer power. This is a colourful and photo, but there does not appear to be any alteration or emphasis on a specific hue or tone. There is no real framing in this image. Trudeau is seen in front, beside, and behind people. While he is distinguishable, there is no emphasis brought to him.

Image 1 Component Content Vectors Observations Trudeau and three other people sit and stand around a table. Everyone is dressed in business attire and Trudeau is working on a computer. Trudeau and the three others are the participants but they are creating vectors with the technology through their body language and gaze. This suggests the technology is a participant as well. The distance suggests this is impersonal and the tall angle suggests viewer power. The oblique angle suggests detachment. The photo is cream and black with no saturation. The framing through the walls focuses the group in the middle without excessive brightness. The photo was edited to create a blocked frame on the top and bottom of the photo.

Image 2 Component Content Observations The posting shows two images stitched together: each one shows Trudeau dumping a bucket of water on different people. It is assumed this is for the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, popular in the summer of 2014. Trudeau, the Liberal MPs, the small crowd, and the buckets of water are the participants in the image. The vector of Trudeau dumping the water is key. The medium shot suggests a social image. The angle suggests equality. A filter via Instagram's editing options was added to give a yellow, warm hue. By putting together two photos, they are framed with literal frames. The crowd in the background also creates a smaller frame. The salience is really emphasized by how big Trudeau and the ice bucket participants are in comparison to the people behind them. 62

Image 3 Component Content Vectors Distance and Angles Observations Trudeau and Grégoire walk through a crowd, smiling and waving. Some members of the crowd hold red campaign signs that read "Justin." Grégoire, Trudeau, the crowd and the signs are the participants. Given the distance, it is difficult to tell if Trudeau's gaze is at the camera or not. The far distance is impersonal but this is juxtaposed with the crowd surrounding Trudeau and Grégoire. The angle is low suggesting that the participants hold the power. The photo appears to be grainy. The crowd naturally creates a frame as they walk toward the camera.

Image 4 Component Content Vectors Observations Trudeau is shaking hands with a woman. There is a crowd of people looking on. Trudeau, the woman, and the crowd are the participants. The handshake and gaze between Trudeau and the woman suggest a conversation or interaction taking place. The gaze from the crowd focuses on the two of them. The close distance suggests a personal photo and the angle is eye-level and suggests equality. There are dark blue and grey hues, but the camera seems to focus on the handshake and interaction. The crowd and its gaze create a frame centering on Trudeau and the woman.

also shows multiple Liberal Party signs with the name Celina Caesar-Chavannes. It is assumed the woman is Caesar-Chavannes. The main participant seems to be Caesar-Chavannes. She creates a vector with the microphone. She is in between the audience (foreground) and Trudeau (background). The gazes from the other participants tend to focus on Caesar-Chavannes as well. The medium distance suggests this is a social photo and the eye-level angle suggests equality. The heavy use of red suggests this is a Liberal event. The black foreground emphasizes the red colours and the participants. Trudeau is positioned in the background and off centered, but still framed by the signs and the audience in the foreground.

Image 6 Component Content Vectors Observations Margaret Trudeau smiling with her three sons, including Justin Trudeau. This is an older image because the sons are young children in the image. Margaret and her three sons are the participants. They are engaging directly with the viewers with eye contact. They are all touching or sitting closely together, suggesting an intimate bond. This is a close distance photo, suggesting it is a personal photo. The angle is eye-level and suggests equality. The background is dark and natural light adds brightness. The photo is dated and there are visible scratches and marks on the print. There is nothing too notable about the composition. It seems like an evenly structured photo (participants in the middle, close together) with no framing.

Observations The people in the photo have their backs turned, but based on appearance, I assume one of the participants is Trudeau. Trudeau and the other participant have their arms around each other and their arms raised, suggesting celebration. The crowd around them are taking photos, looking at them, or "patting them on the back" as they walk into the crowd. The far background has red signs, suggesting this is a Liberal event. Trudeau and the unnamed person are the participants and it is assumed, based on the vectors and setting, that they are peers in the political realm. The focus is on them based on the gaze from the crowd. The medium distance makes this a social photo. The angle is eye level and suggests equality. The yellow tones suggest warmth and the brightness draws attention to the spotlight on Trudeau and the other participant. By being enveloped by a crowd, Trudeau and his peer are framed by it. This composition really emphasizes that they are the focus of the photo and group.

Image 9 Component Content Vectors Observations Trudeau in a crowd of people and taking a seflie with some of the people. Trudeau and the people in the photo are the participants. The gaze into the camera phone shows a vector and intent to take a selfie. The vectors suggest a busy venue or event. The long distance suggests the photo is impersonal but the crowd juxtaposes this. There is a slightly high angle, which normally suggests power for the viewer, but it seems to mirror the selfie angle. The oblique angle 65

suggests detachment. There are a lot of red shirts, which suggests this is a Liberal event. The saturation emphasizes the colour red. Unlike previous photos of Trudeau in a crowd, there is no obvious framing that makes Trudeau stand out. The line from the arm taking the selfie creates some focus on the interaction.

Image 10 Component Content Observations Trudeau and another person (perhaps a colleague) are on separate phones and not engaging with each other, but with the conversations on their separate phone lines. The setting looks like a hotel room. Trudeau, the other person in the room, and the telephones are all participants. The phones symbolize the people on the other end of the line. The vectors and gaze of Trudeau and other person suggest that they are engaging in separate conversations and not working together. However, the mirrored image suggests they are colleagues. The far distance suggests this is an impersonal photo and this is mirrored through Trudeau's body language. Trudeau is in the brighter foreground and his colleague is in the darker corner, dressed darkly. Trudeau and his colleague seem to create a frame of the room with their bodies staged on either end of it.

Image 11 Component Content Observations Trudeau, dressed in a cultural outfit, is holding a camera and smiling behind it. He is outside in a crowd that seems equally engaged with something outside of the image. Trudeau and the crowd around him are the participants. The gaze is also equally split among the members of the crowd behind him, as some are focusing on something off-camera and others are looking at Trudeau. The medium distance suggests it is a social photo and the eye-level angle suggests equality. 66

There appears to be some darkening in the corners of the photo, likely due to an Instagram edit. The gaze from the participants in the crowd creates a frame around Trudeau.

Image 12 Component Content Vectors Observations Trudeau is in a big room with a large crowd. He is holding a microphone and he is the focus of the crowd and photo. Trudeau and the crowd are the participants. In general, the gaze from the crowd is focused on Trudeau and Trudeau returns the gaze with body language. The oblique angle suggests detachment. The distance suggests it is impersonal. The distance is able to capture a large room full of people. The foreground is dark and Trudeau in the background is very bright. The juxtaposition adds focus to Trudeau. The stage in the far right and the crowd around it creates a frame surrounding Trudeau. Trudeau is also really small in this photo despite the frame emphasizing his presence.

Image 13 Component Content Observations This Instagram posting features three different photos stitched together. In the top left, Trudeau is engaging with a woman dressed in traditional Chinese clothing. In the top right, Trudeau is wearing the head of the red Chinese dragon. In the bottom panel, Trudeau and members of the community are participating in a ceremonial event. Throughout all three images, Trudeau, the community members and the cultural figures are the participants. The gaze tends to be focused on the interaction occurring in the panel. Some of the vectors suggest happiness or celebration. The distances for all three images are medium length, suggesting a social photo. The angles are low in all three photos, meaning the participants have power. 67

There is a lot of red colour in this photo, but this might signify the Chinese tradition because red is seen as a lucky colour. The editing creates a literal frame among the photos. Trudeau is positioned differently in all three photos.

Image 14 Component Content Observations Trudeau is helping his daughter lead a horse forward in a barn. His wife looks on from the side. This photo was posted to Trudeau's account before but it is outside of this data collection. Trudeau, his wife, his daughter (Ella-Grace), the woman in the background and the horse are the participants. Ella-Grace is the only one looking at the camera. The far distance suggests the photo is impersonal. Sophie, Ella-Grace and Trudeau appear brighter with the dark background. The adults surround Ella-Grace and I think her presence is emphasized through her eye contact and the framing.

The bright orange turbans bring attention and emphasize the Sikh holiday. Trudeau is wearing neutral colours and tends to blend into the background a little. Trudeau is slightly taller than the other participants, which brings emphasis to him.

Image 16 Component Content Observations Trudeau and a small group of people are in a manufacturing setting. One individual looks on from inside a large vehicle (perhaps a bus) that is not completely built yet. Trudeau is in the center of the group and appears to be the focus of their attention. Trudeau and the workers are the participants. The workers' gaze focuses on Trudeau. The single person within the vehicle and the vector he creates is unique compared to the group surrounding Trudeau. The oblique angle suggests detachment. The distance removes focus from Trudeau, as the foreground emphasizes the individual in the vehicle. The background is very bright and white and parts of the image are blurry. This is likely from an Instagram editing tool. The one individual standing in the framed structure takes attention away from Trudeau and the people he are speaking with. But at the same time, the crowd creates a frame around Trudeau as well. The composition of these two elements is very competitive.

Trudeau, his daughter, the mascot and the people in the background are all participants. Ella-Grace is gazing at the mascot and Trudeau's gaze is toward his daughter. The hi-five gives some motion to the image. The medium distance suggests a social photo. The image is not saturated and the background seems to have a yellow filter added to it. This might be to remove a dull, gray background because parts of the photo suggest it might be rainy day. The hi-five between the mascot and Ella-Grace creates some framing, but overall, it seems like it is a busy photo without much composition.

Trudeau and the audience are the participants. There is no visible gaze, but it is assumed there is an exchange between the audience and Trudeau. The oblique angle suggests detachment. The distance is social and the angle shows equality. The darkness and minimal brightness hides Trudeau and the audience. The brightness is also hidden based on the angle. Trudeau is slightly off center but the distance between him and the audience suggests he is the focus of the photo.

There is an assumed audience participant. Trudeau is also a participant. There are limited vectors and gazes. The oblique angle suggests detachment. Trudeau is very far away, which suggests the photo is impersonal. However, the angle is shot over the shoulder of an audience member, so it seems slightly intimate because of the angle. The darkness does add some brightness and emphasis to Trudeau in the lit room. There is no saturation or colour. By shooting this photo over the shoulder of a participant, it looks like the photo was taken from his point of view.

Trudeau and the workers are the participants and they seem to be in a serious conversation based on body language and gaze. The medium distant suggests a social photo.

The woman and Trudeau are the participants. Trudeau's gaze seems focused on the woman. The distance is medium length, suggesting the photo is social. The angle is eye level and suggests equality. The brightness from the window in the back and the window in the foreground adds focus to Trudeau and the woman. The window creates a natural frame and the participants are centered in it.

His back is slightly turned away from the camera. Trudeau is the only seen participant but his gaze suggests another person out of the image. The slight oblique angle suggests detachment.

Image 24 Component Content Observations Trudeau is at a table, facing another man, and there is a microphone above him. From a distance, three men are working cameras from different angles. This suggests an interview setting. The participants are representative participants because the focus is between Trudeau and man conducting the interview. The gaze is between Trudeau and interviewers and the cameramen are focusing on them as well. Trudeau's back is to the camera and the oblique angle is uninviting. The distance is impersonal and the angle is eye level and equal. The photo seems to be blurry and remove focus from the participants. The walls and couches seem to create a frame around all four participants, so it seems like they are emphasizing the interview taking place.

Appendix  E:  Interpretation  of  Harper's   Most  Liked  Photos    
Image 1 Component Content Vectors Observations Harper is in a crowd of people wearing a red Team Canada hockey jersey. Harper is giving a hi-five to an unseen individual. He is smiling. Harper and the crowd are the participants. Harper shows celebration with the hi-five and gaze directed toward the unseen individual. The crowd behind him suggests a major event. The slightly lower angle gives Harper power and the slightly oblique angle suggests detachment. The medium distance suggests a social photo. The red and white colours suggest nationalism. Harper's position on the photo emphasizes the sports arena setting. The depth makes him look bigger than the crowd around him and further emphasizes the focus on him.

Distance and Angles Colour, Brightness, Illumination and Saturation Composition

Image 2 Component Content Vectors Distance and Angles Colour, Brightness, Illumination and Saturation Composition Observations Harper, dressed in a suit, is holding a koala. Both Harper and the koala are the participants. The close angle suggests it is a personal photo. The levelled angle suggests equality. The front angle is inviting. The warm, golden tones in the background seem to emphasize the dark koala and Harper's dark suit. As the only two values in the image, the focus is on the koala and Harper.

  

81  

Image 3 Component Content Observations Harper's head is bowed and his hands are together in front of coffin that is draped with the Canadian flag. He is wearing a suit and Laureen Harper is seen in the background, dressed in black. The setting seems to be a church, based on the stained glass windows and plaques in the background. This was posted after the attacks on Parliament in October 2014. Harper and the people behind him are the participants. The coffin is a participant because of the body language and gaze Harper presents to it. The long distance suggests it is an impersonal photo, but the distance offers Harper space while in a moment of mourning. The colours of the flag and window stand out against the neutral tones and black outfits. The red poppies stand out as well which dates the photo and provides some context. The pews create a frame that emphasizes the vector between Harper and the coffin.

Image 4 Component Content Observations Harper and Laureen are dressed in black, walking and holding hands. Harper is looking up, but Laureen's gaze is downward. Neither are smiling. Laureen is carrying white flowers wrapped in brown paper. The background includes yellow tape, perhaps police tape used to secure any area. This was posted around the time of the attack on Parliament on October 2014. Harper and his wife are the participants. The handhold is the vector and shows their relationship. This is the only photo in the data collection where they show physical intimacy like this. The medium distance suggests it is a social photo. Their dark clothing suggests they are heading to a funeral. The yellow tape in the background also stands out and it suggests a secured area, a restricted area, or a crime scene. The participants are the focus of the photo. Their arms create a frame around their hands, which represents their partnership. 82

Image 5 Component Content Observations Harper and his wife are bowing in front of wreath. They are dressed in dark clothing with red poppies. The people behind them are wearing poppies as well. There are people in military uniform behind them. Harper, his wife and the wreath are the participants. Importantly, there is a gaze directed toward the wreath from Harper, suggesting a moment of mourning or reflection. The participants in the background further suggest it is a Remembrance Day ceremony. The long distance suggests this is an impersonal photo, but again, it might instead be a literal action of giving the Harpers space to reflect or grieve. The dark colours emphasize the red poppies. The wreath's colours also emphasize its presence. The wreath in the foreground and the repetitive lines of people dressed darkly draws attention to it.

Image 6 Component Content Observations Harper is facing German Chancellor Angela Merkel and they are shaking hands. They are both behind separate podiums. There are multiple Canadian flags in the background. Harper and Merkel are the participants and their gaze and handshake emphasizes their professional exchange. The medium distance suggests this is a social photo. The front and level angle suggests stability and equality. There is a heavy use of red colours, which might emphasize the professional setting for a meeting between international leaders. Although it hides them, positioning both Harper and Merkel behind the podium bolsters their image as leaders. The straight line of their arms really focuses the image on the handshake, which is slightly off center.

Nash's arms around Harper and the teen. Nash, Harper and the unknown youth are the participants. The vector suggests they are friendly. The medium distance suggests this is a social photo. Nash's neutral outfit draws attention to him. The dark colours on either side of Nash frame him and draw attention to him, especially because he is in the center of the photo.

Image 8 Component Content Observations Harper is posing with two men, at least one of them appears to be an athlete based on his attire. All three of them are holding or have a hand placed on a gold basketball. Harper, the athletes and the basketball players are the participants. Their body language is stiffer compared to image 7 (also with a basketball player). The medium distance suggests this is a social photo. The dark clothing emphasizes the golden basketball. Harper looks framed by two taller people, but the forward motion of the gold basketball seems to bring more attention to it.

Image 9 Component Content Vectors Distance and Angles Observations Harper is shaking hands with Malala Yousafzai. Harper and Yousafzai are the participants. The vector is the handshake. The gaze is between the participants. The medium distance suggests this is a social photo. The equal and frontal angles show equality and involvement.

Colour, Brightness, Illumination and Saturation Composition

The photo seems slightly out of focus. With Harper's height and gaze, the vector and composition lines put focus on Yousafzai.

Image 10 Component Content Observations Harper is standing over a coffin draped in the Canadian flag and he is about to touch it with his open palm. It looks like a church setting (candles, stained glass windows). Harper and the coffin are the participants. It is assumed the coffin symbolizes Jim Flaherty. The vector of Harper almost touching the coffin is interesting because it shows his grief in motion. The medium distance is considered a social distance, but given the context, it might be a respectable distance to photograph Harper as he participates in the funeral. The brightness really emphasizes the Canadian flag. Harper is again dressed in dark clothes, which emphasizes the setting and context. The coffin looks like it creates a frame by dividing Harper from the people seated in the background. Harper is off centered in the photo and this gives more attention to the coffin.

Image 11 Component Content Vectors Distance and Angles Colour, Brightness, Illumination and Saturation Composition Observations Harper is in a snowy setting with Bonhomme, a mascot for Quebec's winter carnival. Harper and Bonhomme are the participants. Harper is engaged with the mascot and his gaze is toward it. Their body language suggests they are walking or in motion. The medium distance is a social distance. The angle is slightly lower. There is a lot of white ­ perhaps emphasizing the snow and cold. Harper stands out in his black winter clothes. Nothing notable.

  

85  

Image 12 Component Content Vectors Distance and Angles Colour, Brightness, Illumination and Saturation Composition Observations Harper and Bonhomme in a snow/ice structure. Harper and Bonhomme are the participants. Their gaze seems to be at the structure or something off camera. Their body language suggests they are in conversation. The medium distance is a social distance. The lower angle gives power to the participants. The front angle suggests involvement. The bright coloured spots illuminate the blue/ice structure. Bonhomme looks a lot larger in this photo compared to Image 11, so the change is size brings some emphasis to him.

Image 13 Component Content Observations Harper, an unidentifiable veteran, and one of Harper's ministers are standing together and holding a box with a Canadian emblem on it. There are Canadian flags in the background. Harper, the minister and the veteran are the participants. The box is also a participant and symbolize the gift or award. The body language suggests this is a posed photo. The medium distance suggests this is social photo. The frontal and level angles suggest it is involvement and equality. The box is emphasized against the dark clothing. Their arms create lines that bring attention to the box, but it is slightly low on the photo.

Harper, Hollande and Johnson are the participants. Their gazes suggest they are talking to each other. The medium distance is a social distance. The frontal angle is slight off center, but not enough to be oblique. The angle is also eye level and suggests equality. The dark business colours stand out against the bright mountain background. The fencing creates some framing around the participants. The relative sizing makes the participants look bigger against the mountain background.

Image 14B Component Content Vectors Distance and Angles Colour, Brightness, Illumination and Saturation Composition Image 16A Component Content Observations Harper is at a podium with a sign that states "Protecting Canadians." Quebec's provincial flag is in the background. Harper is speaking with his body forward and his arms raised to shoulder-level. Harper is the participant. His gaze is at the unseen audience behind the camera. The medium distance suggests this is a social photo. The frontal angle suggests involvement. The slightly lower angle gives power to the participant. There are a lot of blue hues in this photo, which compliments the blue colour associated with Conservative Party branding. Observations Harper is on the phone, seated at a desk in an office setting. He is holding the phone up to his ear with his shoulder. Harper and the phone are the participants. The phone symbolizes the person on the phone. His gaze is downward, toward his desk. This suggests focus. The medium distance is a social distance. The frontal and eye level angles suggest equality and involvement. The neutral/darker background gives emphasis to Harper in his brighter/crisper white shirt. Nothing notable.

The lines of the Québécois flag center Harper and bring focus to him. His arms also create lines that mimic the flag.

Image 16B Component Content Vectors Observations Harper is in the House of Commons, shaking hands with an unidentifiable. The Members of Parliament behind Harper are clapping and watching the exchange. Harper and the MPs are the participants. Harper and the man shaking hands suggest a formal celebration or acknowledgement of something happening in their favour in the House. The applauding audience supports this. The medium distance suggests a social photo. While the photo is taken at eye level that suggests equality, the oblique angle suggests detachment. The setting's neutral colours suggest it is a professional space. Nothing notable.

Observations An army helicopter (indicated by the designs on the body of the craft) is flying in front of the Peace Tower at Parliament Hill. The helicopter is a participant. It symbolizes the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF). The slightly lower angle gives the participant power. The distance is difficult to gage and assess based on this photo. The colours of the helicopter help solidify its status as an aircraft from the CAF. The line of the Peace Tower's column creates some inverted framing.

  

88  

Image 19 Component Content Observations Harper is shaking hands with Bill Gates. The setting looks like it might be a room on Parliament Hill. It might be one of Harper's offices because the background features a family photo of him and his family. Harper and Gates are the participants. Their gazes seem to focus on each other and their exchange. The handshake vector suggests this is a formal or professional meeting. The medium distance suggests this is a social photo. The photo is at eye level and suggests equality. The frontal angle suggests involvement. The colours and composition are not notable. Again, there are a lot of neutrals (browns, blacks) in the photo, which suggests a business setting. The lines of the arms focus the attention on the handshake. I think it looks like Harper and Gates frame the picture of Harper with his family. This is interesting since Gates came to speak to an event discussing women and children.

There is a seated audience as well as a group of people who are dressed like manufacturing workers. Harper is speaking from the podium. Harper is the participant. His gaze and gesture suggests he is speaking to the seated audience. The repetitive stance and body language of the group of people behind Harper makes them look like they are on display. The long distance suggests this is an impersonal photo and it is a slightly high angle, giving the viewer power. The neutral floor/background setting really emphasizes the workers dress in white. They look very bright. The blue placard is centered and a unique colour to the photo, so it draws a lot of attention to itself. The workers in white and the audience frame harper. He is centered in the photo.

Image 20B Component Content Observations Harper is at an ice cream shop with a cup of ice cream in his hand. He is dressed in a suit. He is pointing to some of the ice cream and desserts in the window. There appears to be someone beside him, but the photo cuts him/her off. Behind the counter, there is someone serving Harper. Harper and the ice cream are the participants. Based on his vector and body language, he might be looking at the selection. This is a far distance photo, suggesting it is impersonal. Its angles are front-facing and eye level. The brightness seems to focus on the ice cream behind the glass. Harper's dark suit seems to blend into the dark background. Nothing notable.

Observations Harper and two other unidentifiable people are riding snowmobiles in a snowy setting. Harper is difficult to identify because all three participants are wearing helmets. Harper, the unidentified people, and the snowmobiles are the participants. The vectors show them riding the snowmobiles with some momentum. The distance is long, suggesting an impersonal photo. The snow illuminates parts of the photo because of the sun's reflection. The brightness juxtaposes the dark figures of the snowmobile riders. The lines in the snow and puff of snow in the air create momentum in the photo. Harper is in the foreground and off center.

   Image 1A Component Content Vectors Distance and Angles Colour, Brightness, Illumination and Saturation Composition Observations Harper is handing out ice cream to a veteran. There's a banner in the background with army-based figurines and the word, "Rideau." Harper and the veteran are the participants. The vector is Harper giving the ice cream to the veteran. The gaze seems to focus on the ice cream. The medium distance suggests this is a social photo. The angle is slightly below level, giving power to the participants. The photo is fairly average in this component. There are limited changes to depth, saturation, or brightness. Harper's body language and the line of his arm extending the ice cream toward him emphasize the veteran.

Image 1B Component Content Observations Harper is presenting a box to two people and a third looks on at the exchange. Harper's back is turned to the camera. The background looks like it might be at Parliament Hill, perhaps Harper's office because there are personal photos in the background. Harper, the box and three people are the participants. The box could symbolize the award or gift it might be. The gazes and body language are also directed toward the exchange. Harper's back to the camera is unlike most of his photos and shows detachment. The medium distance is social. There is very little colour in this photo: it has a very neutral palette. The four figures and the two sets of out reached arms create a frame around the box. 93

Image 3A Component Content Observations It is assumed that the participant in the photo is Harper. His back is turned to the camera. In French, it says it is the 70th anniversary of the Normandy landing and the location and date. The background features musicians and soldiers. Harper is the participant. The back turned, like the previous photo, is unique to Harper's data collection so far. It shows detachment but the close distance also suggests it is a personal photo. The depth and darkness of Harper's suit draws attention to Harper. The colourful background emphasizes it. Harper is centered and looks distant from the crowd in the background.

He appears to be speaking. He is seated behind a microphone, mirroring his peers, with a name plate. Harper and the members of the event are the participants. At least one participant's (Margaret Kenyatta's) gaze is toward Harper, who appears to be photographed mid-speech. The far distance is impersonal and separates the viewer from the conference attendees. The photo seems to be taken from a higher angle to give Harper height as well, giving him some power and height over the viewer and other participants. There are a lot of blue hues in this photo. The depth emphasizes Harper and minimizes the participants in the foreground. Harper is in the top left corner but the relative size makes him look bigger and a focal point. Observations Harper is shaking hands with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. It looks like they are in a hotel conference room. Abbott and Harper are the participants. The vector and gaze are focused on each other. They are in conversation. The medium distance suggests this is a social photo. The frontal angle and eye level angle suggests it involves the viewers and see them as equals. The background has poor lighting that has a bit of a golden hue to it. The depth focuses on Harper and Abbott. The arms create lines that emphasize the handshake.

One of them is holding an unidentifiable flag. The architecture is dated. Harper and the soldiers are the participants. The soldiers are an interesting feature because they form a line/vector that points to Harper and their gaze mimics this. Harper is far away, so the close distance emphasizes the soldiers. The depth emphasizes the soldiers. There are a lot of neutral colours worn and the only real colour is the red carpet and flag. Harper blends into the setting. The line created by the soldiers stops at Harper and draws attention to him.
