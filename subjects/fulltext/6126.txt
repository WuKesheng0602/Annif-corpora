Regional Contributions to Achieving Sustainability - An Examination Using Sustainability-Focused Policies in the Regional Official Plans, Master of Applied Science, 2010 Elisabeth Perlikowski, Environmental Applied Science and Management, Ryerson University

Abstract

This research examines the policy content of the Regional Official Plans in order to provide insight whether the regions of York and Peel are moving towards achieving sustainability. The study's exploratory qualitative and comparative analysis examines the Regions' contributions using the planning policies outlined in the recently released Regional Official Plans. Findings suggest that the Regions have emphasized sustainability-focused policies and have laid a foundation in achieving environmental and economic elements of sustainability. The analysis shows a low occurrence of policies that integrate social equity and justice issues 'with the economic and environmental objectives, which reduces the prospect of achieving sustainability. The comparative analysis suggests a number of directives that further can decrease the move towards achieving sustainability, including voluntary policies and indicators that may mislead a community in its progress towards sustainability. The study found that the Region of Peel has a higher presence of factors that can weaken the chances of achieving sustainability.

Chapter 1: Introduction
Most scientists and international bodies that foresee serious consequences such as environmental degradation, social ailments and poor economic development do not advocate a complete halt in the use of natural resources. However, they do believe that society should consider the planet's limits and the global consequences that unsustainable patterns can have (Boyd and Suzuki, 2008; Chakrabarty, 2001 cited in World Bank, 1991 and Cheema, 1993; ICLEI, lDRC and UNEP, 1996; Hammond, 2006; Hempel, 1996; Meadows et al., 2005; Roseland, 2005; United Nations Environment Program, 2009; WCED, 1987). They believe that global environmental protection and sustainability begins: · With industrialized nations, which account for a higher share of the world's resource use, energy consumption and environmental pollution. · In urban areas, as urbanization and the economic development status of a country are closely linked, and the urban population is on the rise, requiring sustainable solutions. · At the community level, which is ''the level where complex living systems are most interdependent and vulnerable" (Hempel, 1996,6 cited in Orr, 1992 and Sale, 1985). As many researchers and international bodies view the concept of sustainability as a long-term solution that needs to be executed at a local level, an increasing number of local governments have begun planning their communities with sustainability in mind. A review of Canadian and American local governments shows that many have been working towards applying the concept of sustainability by implementing local policies, programs and action plans (Berke and Manta Conroy, 2000; Conroy, 2006; Jepson, 2004; Parkinson and Roseland, 2002; Portney, 2002; Saha and Paterson, 2008), although research studies evaluating local governments' progress towards achieving sustainability are finding that performance has

1

been limited even when sustainability-focused policies are in place (Tsenkova and Damiani. 2009). Governmental policies represent what the government intends to do or not do to govern its community (Wellington, ES8921), and they playa crucial role in achieving any community goal, such as sustainability. Is it possible to know at the policy-making stage the potential of achieving sustainability? Kno'Wlng the direction a community will be taken by government policies before implementing those policies can provide valuable insight and opportunities to create policies with desired results. Ontario's municipalities have recently tailored their Official Plans to conform \vith provincial legislation that focuses on sustainable growth and environmental protection, most notably the Places to Grow Act (2005), incorporating sustainability principles and creating sustainability-focused policies in their Official Plans. The Official Plan consists ofland-use policies that provide a road map for the community and that is guided by provincial legislation (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2009). The Official Plan needs to be consistent with the Provincial Policy Statement issued under the Planning Act and conform to or not conniet with any applicable provincial plans. The Provincial Policy Statement contains policy directions on matters of provincial interest related to land use planning and development. The Official Plan is reviewed and updated at least every five years, as mandated by the Planning Act, to ensure that the plan implements any changes to the Provincial Policy Statement or other provincial legislation requiring updates to the Official Plan, such as the Places to Grow Act. The five-year review is also an opportunity to ensure the Official Plan continues to address local priorities and changing community needs. The Official Plan is prepared with input from the community and helps to ensure that future planning and development will meet the specific needs of that community. The Official Plans examined during this study have a time horizon of twenty-five years (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2005, 2009).

The British North America Act in 1867 gave provincial governments powers over mtmicipal governments, and the province of Ontario gives direction to mtmicipalities regarding their responsibilities via provincial legislation. Mtmicipalities are starting to implement their O\\TI Official Plans, which are in line with provincial law, and \\'ill review them in five years as mandated by the Planning Act (1990). Given the five-year Official Plan review period, and that ex post evaluations of communities with sustainability-focused policies showed limited results in moving commtmities towards sustainability, this research seeks to examine the policy content of Official Plans in order to provide insight whether two Ontario mtmicipalities, the regions of York and Peel, are moving forward towards achieving sustainability .

Sustainabllity - Context

The definition of sustainable development and sustainability is ambiguous (Saha and Paterson, 2008) with over 70 definitions in circulation (Lozano, 2008). The terms sustainable development and sustainability are used interchangeably in the literature reviewed. On the surface, these terms refer to a state "that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" (WCED, 1987, 1). Sustainable development and sustainability have the same objective of integrating natural, economic, and social systems (Mebratu, 1998) in order to ensure that natural resources, social equity and justice, and economic development are available now and in the future. This paper, similarly to the literature reviewed, uses the terms interchangeably and is guided by the BrundtIand Report's (WCED, 1987) definition of sustainable development and sustainability. Although on the surface sustainability appears to be a simple concept of

3

making sure that current and future generations have a decent standard of living while living within the limits of natural systems (Berke and Manta Conroy, 2000), putting this idea into practice can be very complex, as it requires dealing ",ith multiple self·organizing systems: the environment, the economy and the society (Dale, 2001). The challenge of sustain ability is that there is no simple way to model and predict the interaction of individuals, societies and natural systems (Abolina and ZHans, 2002). This complexity is one of the reasons sustainability has over 70 definitions in circulation but no one working definition (Lozano, 2008). There are common characteristics found in the literature review that can be used to derive a more precise definition. One characteristic is «dynamic". Sustainability consists of self·regulating and contradicting environmental, economic and social systems that continuously change and impact each other. Sustainability requires the community to pursue an evolving and ever-changing approach which allows to evaluate community's state with respect to sustainability as well as ongoing means to negotiate conflicts in order to move a community in the direction of becoming more sustainable (Berke and Manta Conroy, 2000). Another characteristic is "integration" of environmental, economic and social elements of sustainability as without integration sustainability cannot be achieved or sustained (Hempel, 1996; WCED, 1987). The objectives of the three sustainability pillars often contradict and compete with one another (lCLEI. IDRC and UNEP, 1996). Achieving integration usually involves coordination, negotiation and compromise (Berke and Manta Conroy, 2000). The literature on sustainable development has advanced in defining key characteristics of the concept that are relevant to the theory and practice of planning (Berke and Manta Conroy, 2000). Considering the scope of the research, this study's working definition of sustainability is as follows: sustainable development or susta/nability is a dynamic process and state in
wltic/z cONwtunities anticipate and accomnwdate the needs 0/ cu"ent and/uture

4

generations in ways tllat integrate local social, economic and ecological systems (Berke and Manta Conroy, 2000).
As mentioned earlier, many researchers (Hempel, 1996; Lozano, 2008; Meadows et aI., 2005) view the concept of sustainability as a long-term solution to global environmental degradation, social ailments and economic development. Globa1 environmental degradation includes a reduction in water resources, a reduction in food and energy production, and the destruction and changing of the ecosystem, including biodiversity, all of which impact human and nonhuman nature (Hempel, 1996). The economic element favours market expansion and growth, externalization of costs, and sustained private profit, while social development concerns itself W1th meeting basic human needs, increasing economic and social equity, and creating community self-reliance (ICLEI, IDRC and UNEP, 1996). Some associate the state of our current environment with the advances made in the economy and industrialization over the last 100 years (Lozano, 2008), but a historical review of sustainability shows evidence that "ecological factors were key elements in the rise and fall of ancient civilization and in two of the major social transformations, namely, the agricultural and industrial transformations" (Mebratu, 1998, 517). The concept of sustainability can be tracked back to Thomas Robert Malthus (1766-1834), who is considered to be the first economist to foresee the limits to growth caused by resource scarcity (Mebratu, 1998). In the twentieth century, researchers such as Meadows (1972) evaluated nature's carrying capacity and society's needs and wants in the Limits to Growth model. However, it was the Brundtland Report (WCED, 1981) that brought the idea of sustainability to the mainstream with its definition of sustainable development. Although sustainable development has been proposed as a solution to integrate sociopolitical decisions with the environment, this concept is not without deficiencies and concerns. Sustainability has over 70 definitions in circulation but there is no agreed-upon

5

\\lorking definition (Lozano, 2008). Some interpret the concept as being gro\vth-oriented and that it does not place sufficient emphasis on limiting growth and consumption (Robinson, 2008 cited in Sachs, 1999). Others believe that sustainability efforts in an industrialized country can limit the potential for developing countries to prosper (Robinson, 2008 cited in Banerjee, 2003 and Carruthers, 2001). Lastly, the concept might bring difficulties to communities that have historically relied on natural resources for their well-being (Pierce and Dale, 1999). Many environmentalists will point out that rapid responses are required to deal with global environmental problems but according to Hempel (1996) human responses are determined less by the need for action than by the complexity of cultural, political and economic institutions through which action is organized. As Hempel says, "For sustainability to be acted upon, it must be possible for the desirability of environmental and socio-political characteristics of the world to be expressed in the political realm" (1996, 9). Many researchers and institutions, including Hempel (1996), Roseland (2005), ICLEI, IDRC and UNEP (1996), and the ICLEI (2010), believe that global environmental protection and sustainability begins at the community level, which is "the level where complex living systems are most interdependent and vulnerable (Hempel, 1996, 6 cited in Orr, 1992 and Sale, 1985). Many have identified local governments to be in the best position to drive their communities to sustainability (Federation of Canadian Municipalities, 2009~ Hempel,
1996~

ICLEI, IDRC and UNEP 1996; Roseland, 2005). The local level of government \\?as created in Canada to provide infrastructure serv'ices such as transportation and traffic management, water, wastewater and waste management, and land-use planning to their communities (Tindal and Tindal, 2004). Roseland (2005) refers to these services as sustainability building blocks and believes that local governments' insights into their communities' needs makes them critical in the movement towards sustainability.

This research concentrates on Canada which, as a developed country, accounts for a disproportionate share of the world's resource use, energy consumption and environmental pollution (Boyd and Suzuki, 2008; WCED, 1987). Environmentally unsustainable practices in developed countries originate in housing, food and transportation, which make up 80% of the ecological footprint of people living in industrialized nations (Boyd and Suzuki, 2008). This research also focuses on an urban area in Canada, as studies show that urbanization and the economic development status of a country are closely linked, and that the world's urban population is on the rise (Chakrabarty, 2001 cited in World Bank, 1991 and Cheema, 1993; United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2007). Urbanization, without proper focus and policies creates unsustainable communities with escalating land prices, pollution and deterioration of the urban environment (Chakrabarty, 2001). The world's urban population is increasing at a very fast pace; in 2005, 74% of the population of the more developed regions was urban, and this number is projected to reach 81 % by 2030 (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2007). According to Statistics Canada (2006), 80% of all Canadians lived in an urban area as of 2006. The Places to Grow Act (2005) forecasts that some of the Greater Golden Horseshoe regions' populations are expected to increase by 30% to 40% by 2031 (see Table 2: Community Profile for current and forecasted population). This expected grO\'vth will place more pressure on the surrounding ecosystem as demand for additional housing increases, which can be a driver for more urbanization and consumption of natural resources (Tarasofs l-y , 2006). As urban areas experience such unprecedented population growth, they carry a great deal of responsibility and power in achieving sustainable communities and in determining whether they will provide future generations \\--jth the ability to meet their o\\-n needs.

Govel'l1ments, Relationships and Responsibilities

The need for local governments in Canada became evident in the 1830s when many communities in Canada ,.. ere still governed by more senior levels of government. A local level of government was created to provide infrastructure services such as roads, water and waste management, and land planning to communities (Tindal and Tindal, 2004). Today, the Canadian government is made up of the federal, prm:incial and municipal governments, whose responsibilities were divided in the British North America Act in 1867. The federal government's ability to affect sustainability can be found in its powers over waters, fisheries, the regulation of trade and commerce, its system of taxation and its influence on peace, order and good government. The provincial government has powers over natural resources and the environment, property, civil rights, local works and undertakings, and over municipal institutions. Municipal government's " ... functions, finances, governing structure - even their very existence - depend upon provincial authority" (Tindal and Tindal, 2004, 10), and Hodge (2003,98) explains that "it is common to find municipalities referred to as 'creatures' of the provincial government." Appendix A lists provincial responsibilities and what the province has mandated as the responsibilities of municipalities, which are further divided between upper-tier and lower-tier municipal governments. Depending on the community size and its history, a municipal government can have multiple levels. A local municipality may be called a city, a town, a township or a village. They are also referred to as "lower tier" municipalities when there is another level of municipal government like a county or region involved in providing services. A county or regional government is a federation ofthe local municipalities within its boundaries. Where there is only one level of municipal government in an area, it is called a single tier municipality (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2010).

Ontario Sustainable Legislation - Context Since the election of the Ontario McGuinty Liberal government in 2003, there has been a significant shift in policy regime from the HarrislEves Progressive Conservative government (1995-2003), regarding growih management and sustainability issues. The province has introduced a range of legislation mandating that municipalities build sustainability and environmental protection into planning and development (EMA Canada Inc., 2008). The province has introduced an amendment to the Planning Act in 2007 and updated the PrOVincial Policy Statement in 2005 in support of sustainability. It has also introduced new legislation to manage growth and protect natural resources (Government of Ontario, 2005a, 2005b, 2005c, 2008a, 2008b; Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2005, 2007): · · Clean Water Act, 2005 - protects existing and future sources of drinking water. Greenbelt Act, 2005 - allocates and utilizes natural resources in order to sustain and preserve Ontario's urban, rural, greenfield and agriculture lands. · · Places to Grow Act, 2005 -manages growth in a sustainable manner. PrOVincial Policy Statement, 2005 - contributed to efficient land-use planning and development. · Amendment to Planning Act, 2007 - expanded the list of matters to include the promotion of development that is designed to be sustainable. · Green Energy Act, 2008 -invests in renewable energy projects, increases conservation, and creates green jobs and economic grow1h.

· Lake Simcoe Protection Act, 2008 - protects and restores the ecological health of the
Lake Simcoe watershed.

Ontario's municipalities have been mandated to confonn their Official Plans to the new and amended legislation listed above. Many municipalities, especially upper and single tiers. have recently confonned to legislation issued before 200&. Currently, the upper tier government is working with their local municipalities to comply with the confonned Official Plans. The confonned Official Plans will be in line with most of the sustainability-related legislation listed above, but this research approach and focus is mainly on the Places to Grow
Act's Greater Golden Horseshoe (GGH) growth plan. The growth plan for the GGR was

prepared under the Places to Grow Act and is a framework to better manage growih in the GGH to 2031 and beyond. The Growih Plan's framework and objectives support the concept and systems that contribute to achieving sustainability. It guides decisions on transportation, infrastructure planning, land-use planning, housing and resource protection, which are considered the building blocks of sustain ability (Roseland, 2005). The plan's guiding principle is that "communities will be supported by the pillars of a strong economy> clean and healthy environment and social equity" (Ministry of Public Infrastructure Renewal, 2006, 9).

Government and Pu blic Support of the Places to Grow Act Government support.
Planning experience drawn from communities in the United Kingdom shows that the political will of local government is essential for a shift from business-as-usual to sustainable development (Urban Strategies Inc., 2005). According to Ontario's Growih Secretariat (K. Ryan, personal communication, May 26. 2010), the provincial government has made a number of infrastructure investment programs, many of \,.,hich support growth planning in the GGH. Since 2003, the Province of Ontario has invested approximately $25.2 billion in infrastructure in the GGH. These investment programs are:

10

·

Building Canada Fund· Communities Component, which has approximately a $600million budget. As of June 2009, financial support was distributed across ten sectors, all of which have the potential to contribute to sustainability. The largest amounts were allocated to projects for recreation infrastructure, water and wastewater infrastructure, and local roads, each project receiving approximately $100 million. The smallest amounts were allocated to regional and local airports, and solid waste management, each receiving less than $70,000 (Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure,2010a).

·

The Infrastructure Stimulus Fund is a $4-billion fund available for two years focusing on short-term objectives for economic stimulus. As of June 2009, financial support was distributed across 12 sectors, all of which have the potential to impact sustainable development. The largest amounts were allocated to projects for local roads, water and wastewater infrastructure, and municipal buildings, which received over $350 million each, and the smallest amount was allocated to Brownfield redevelopment, which received $1.3 million (Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, 2009a).

·

The Recreational Infrastructure Canada program supports the renewal and upgrading of recreational facilities in communities. An estimated $380 million is dedicated to recreational projects (Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, 2009b).

·

The Knowledge Infrastructure Program supports college and university infrastructure projects with $2 billion over a period of two years, (Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure,2009c).

·

ReNew Ontario supported the GGH Growth Plan with a five·year, $30-billion plan to revitalize infrastructure throughout Ontario (Ontario Growth Secretariat, K Ryan, personal communication, May 26,2010). Based on ReNew progress reports, the government allocated billions to GGH by funding health care, public transit,

11

highways, water and wastewater infrastructure, and affordable housing (Ministry of Energy and lnfrastructure, 2006, 2007), · Metrolinx, which was created in 2008, is the province's regional transportation agency for the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, and has a mission "to champion, develop and implement an integrated transportation system for our region that enhances prosperity, sustainability and quality oflife" (Metrolinx, 2010a). "The Big Move" is Metrolinx's current regional transportation plan, which focuses on public and active transportation, and estimates transit capital costs to be $50 billion over a period of25 (Metrolinx,2010a),

Given the programs supporting the Places to Grow Act, the government's financial support appears to be strong, but time will tell whether Ontario's budgets will allot the money needed to make the infrastructure and transportation modifications required to move the GGH towards sustainable development The programs show promise of a strong financial support for recreation, water and wastewater infrastructure, and local roads, all of which receive strong financial contribution from the Building Canada Fund, Infrastructure Stimulus Fund, Recreational Infrastructure Canada and ReNew Ontario (Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, 2006, 2007, 2009a, 2009b, 2010a), The public does have concerns over how the programs and recent Ontario budgets allotted the money, and it appears the government is prioritizing roads over transit (Anonymous, 2010, April 30). The first concern is that local roads still receive substantial financial support from the government Building Canada Fund, Infrastructure Stimulus

Fund and ReNew Ontario programs allotted large sums of money for road repairs, expansions and extensions. The second concern stems from the 2010 provincial budget announcement that delays the $4 billion allotted to transit projects. The delay will impact some regions'

12

rapid bus lane projects by two to three years (Fleischer, 2010, April 30) and other commooities will be delayed in getting fooding for a rapid-transit line (Nolan, 2010, April 8).

Public support.

For the most part, the public supports the activities associated with the Places to Grow Act. According to Wekerle et aI. (2007), the new legislation, and especially the Places to Grow Act, Greenbelt Act and Lake Simcoe Protection Act, received extensive support from planners, environmentalists and the general public. In addition, many GGH residents do not welcome urban sprawl as they know it leads to traffic congestion and prevents commooities from becoming pedestrian-oriented and sustainable (Rai, 2010, April 22), and they commend the Places to Grow Act for including urban design features such as bike paths to increase physical activity (Criscione, 2009, October 16). Some opposition to the Places to Grow Act exists in rural areas of the Greater Toronto Area. The forecasted population and employment gro\V1h numbers were not welcomed (Martin-Robins, 2007, December 21) and in some regions the plan is still to develop a significant number of single dwellings (Anonymous, 2010, Jooe 7). The government and public's support are crucial when making commooity changes that bring changes to the lifestyles of its residents, which is exactly w'hat the Places to Grow Act, with its plan for more compact commooities and a stronger reliance on public transportation, is likely to do. When evaluating the extent to which sustainable policies are adopted in American cities, Jepson (2004) fOood that the key factors limiting progress towards sustainability included fiscal constraints, low public interest and a lack of knowledge. It has been almost five years since the Places to Grow Act was passed and the overall support for it appears to be strong. Up to now, Ontario mooicipalities have conformed their Official Plans to the Places to Grow Act and are beginning to implement sustainability-

13

focused policies. Many municipalities are still waiting for the province to approve their Official Plans-many have received approvals from their municipal councils but in order to be in full conformance provincial approval is required (Government of Ontario, 1990, 2005c). The province's approval of the Official Plans will ensure that the municipalities' plans conform with the Places to Grow Act and other provincial legislation that supports sustainability and environmental protection, such as the Greenbelt Act. However, it's worth asking what kind of tools are used to ensure that the conformed Official Plans will move Ontario's communities towards sustainability. Ontario's goal of moving towards sustainability is specified in many provincial laws, including the Places to Grow Act and Planning Act (Government of Ontario, 1990a, 2005c). Currently, municipal Official Plans are mandated to be reviewed and updated every five years to ensure conformity with provincial legislation and that they continue to address local priorities and changing community needs (Government of Ontario, 1990a). Is the five-year time period ideal to assess progress towards sustainability? The task of measuring progress towards sustainability is a daunting one, as NRTEE (2004) found when it launched an initiative to measure Canada's progress towards sustainability. It is challenging because there is no simple way to model and predict the interaction of individuals, societies and natural systems (Abolina and Zilans, 2002; Dale, 2001; NRTEE, 2004). Measuring progress towards sustainability or performing an ex post evaluation of sustainability can offer a snapshot of the community's state of sustainability (NRTEE, 2004), but the question of when to measure progress is greatly complicated by the existence of social and natural processes that function on different time scales, that is, by" ... the disparity between the time horizon of individual human decisions and that of the natural processes affected by these decisions" (Robinson and Legge, 1990,40). For example, climate changes that can be unambiguously linked to anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHG) may have a lag

14

time of many decades before becoming visible (Hempel, 1996). In order to move towards sustainability, communities need to take quicker actions (Robinson, 2006 cited in Bulkeley. 2006). One way of knowing that sustainability-focused actions are being taken is by assessing them at the time community and policy decisions are made. Past sustainable-related projects have later sho\\n to be unsustainable for several reasons, including that the projects aims were achieved but became unsustainable later on or that the project aims were unsustainable by design (Pediaditi et aI., 2006). The complexity of social and natural processes with much different time scales makes it difficult to know when to assess or measure progress on the issue of sustainability. This leaves the community at risk of missing opportunities if regional policies are only revie\ved every five years. The Regional Official Plans are intended to conform with the Places to Grow Act. They are approved by their respective regional councils but await a response from the province. The local Official Plans are being brought into conformity to the goals and direction of the regions. The Official Plans at both the regional and local levels are still in draft form, therefore there are still opportunities to make policy changes which will further move communities towards achieving sustainability. The pending status of the Official Plans means the research findings and recommendations in this paper have the potential to inform and impact current planning policies. As the next review of planning policies \\111 take place five years from now, this research, which is informed by previous sustainability studies and a literature review of frameworks to measure sustainability, will provide insight into whether Ontario's regions have laid a foundation to move towards achieving sustainable development.

Chapter 2: Methodology
As mentioned earlier, the complexity associated with sustainability makes it challenging to make an assessment based on precise models (Abolina and Zilans, 2002), therefore a probing and holistic approach is needed to examine whether GGH municipalities are moving towards sustainability, which will involve an exploratory qualitative content analysis (Leech and Onwuegbuzie, 2007; Riffle et al., 2005; RiholLx, 2006; Woodrum, 1984). Previous studies of sustainability plans (Abolina and Zilans, 2002; Berke and Manta Conroy, 2000; Conroy, 2006: Jepson, 2004; Parkinson and Roseland, 2002; Portney, 2002; Saba and Paterson, 2008; Tsenkova and Damiani, 2009), which this research is founded on and derived from, concentrated on evaluating the presence of sustainability in urban areas in developed countries and on evaluations of communities, mainly in the United States and Canada, where sustainability-focused polices have been in place for a number of years. This research explores community policies in further detail to assess whether regional government in GGH has laid a foundation for achieving sustainability in how it expressed its long-range planning goals and policies in the Regional Official Plan. As mentioned earlier, the Official Plans are guided by the provincial Planning Act, which requires Ontario's municipalities to provide for a land-use planning system led by provincial policies (Government of Ontario, 1990a). The Regional Official Plans reviewed during this research are intended to conform to the Places

to Grow Act-they are approved by their respective regional councils but await a response
from the province. The provincial-municipal relationship ensures that each region is subject to the same provincial land-use framework, which contributes to establishing a reliable comparative method by focusing on carefully matched cases that are similar to one another. Focusing on

16

comparable cases is recommended in a comparative method with a small-N (Collier, 1991)the comparative methodology will be explained later on in this chapter.

The ,vorking definition defined earlier provides a basis for deriving this study's approach which consists of a sustainability framework and three levels of analysis. The first level of anal.ysis assesses policies in Regional Official Plans in comparison to policy areas that forward sustainability principles. It will determine the presence of sustainably-focused policies \vithin the regions and obtain a holistic view of the regional policies. The first level of analysis provides a basis for determining whether the sustainability focused policies have laid a foundation for the regions to move towards sustainability. The second level of analysis uses an environmental policy integration framework to assess whether regional policies integrate sustainability imperatives or take a piecemeal approach towards sustainability. The third level of analysis compares regions that exhibit comparable and favourable characteristics of sustainability. The objective is to learn the strengths and weaknesses in these regions' efforts to achieve sustainability. The three levels of analysis will examine whether the regions have laid a foundation towards achieving sustainability. Previous sustainability studies found that the presence of sustainable activities in a community is a piecemeal indicator of sustainability but not necessarily an indicator that the community is moving towards sustainability (Tsenkova and Damiani, 2009). The level one analysis will determine the presence of sustainable activities within the regions while the second level of analysis will determine whether these activities are integrated. The policy integration framework helps assess which imperatives of sustainability are integrated and to what extent (Runhaar et al., 2008). According to Lafferty and Hovden (2003), one of the key defining features of sustainable development is the importance of integrating sustainability elements with one another and into other policy

17

sectors to ensure they are mutually supportive. The integration of sustainability environmental, economic and social elements is necessary. as sustainability cannot advance without making progress in all three imperatives simultaneously (Hempel, 1996; WCED, 1987). The third level of analysis examines comparable cases \\'ith community characteristics that are considered favourable (Portney, 2002) to achieving sustainability. The objective of the third level of analysis is to learn about the unique actions these communities take that can impact (positively or negatively) their move towards sustainability which have not been captured by the previous levels of analyses. The obj ecti ve of performing a detail revie\v is to obtain a holistic view of each policy area, each sustainability imperative and each case studied. The decision to perform a detailed review was derived from Hodge's (1997) set of principles that serve as criteria to determine progress towards sustainability. Hodge's (1997) principles are based on a review of29 conceptual models that address the human-ecosystem relationships. Hodge (1997) indicated the importance of measuring progress towards sustainability by looking at different factors and variables that exist within a humanecosystem relationship, including assessment of space, time horizon, components of the ecosystem, uncertainty, anticipation, imposed stress and equity. The decision to capture regional policies that both support and oppose specific policy areas, along with the type of sustainable activities that are driven by regional policies, and incorporating Berke and Manta Conroy's (2000) methodology, stems from Hodge's principles of measuring towards sustainability. Berke and Manta Conroy's (2000) methodology of evaluating the extent to which plans promote sustainable development considers whether the policy was "suggested" or "required," vvith suggested policies receiving a lower score than required policies in promoting sustainable development. A higher score represents a higher level of community commitment in achieving sustainability.

18

The sustainability frame\vork and the three levels of analysis create a tool to examine whether sustainably focused regional policies have laid a foundation towards achieving sustainability. The research's focus is on the contributions that the tool makes tmvards determining whether the regions are moving towards sustainability. The methodology for the first level of analysis is discussed in the Presence of Sustainable Activities Analysis section, the second level of analysis is discussed in the Pohcy Integration Analysis section and the third level of analysis is described in the Regional Comparative Analysis section.

Presence of Sustainable Activities Analysis
The presence of sustainably focused activities is established by identifying regional policies \\lth the policy areas that forward sustainability principles. The objective of the first level of analysis is to understand the policy details associated with each policy area in the sustainability framework. The results from this level of analysis do not indicate whether regional policies are moving towards sustainability but it provides a basis for determining ""'hether the sustain ability focused policies have laid a foundation for the regions to move towards sustainability using the exploratory methodologies in the second and third levels of analyses. A holistic view is obtained in the first level by performing a detail review of all the policies in the Regional Official Plans using a coding research protocol. First, regional policies are examined to determine which of them share the characteristics of policy areas that forward sustainability principle (see Table 1 for the list of policy areas that forward sustainability principle and which form a sustainability framework). Each policy in the Regional Official Plan is assigned a policy area from the sustainability framework. The policy area description is matched with the direction and the description of the regional policy. If a regional policy shows signs of either supporting the policy area or not supporting the policy area, it is

19

captured. For example, policies that focus on establishing boundaries around urban gro\vth areas and policies that focus on expanding urban growth boundaries are both captured under the Urban Gmwth Boundary policy area This ensures that the coded regional policies give a holistic view of the policy area in the sustainability framework. If a regional policy does not meet any of the policy areas in the framework, it is assigned a code that denotes it as not applicable. The coding analysis found a number of regional policies that represented mu1tiple policy areas in a single regional policy; for example, smart development provisions and transport demand management initiatives were found to be located in a single regional policy in the Regional Official Plan, and these regional policies have multiple policy areas assigned to them from the sustainability framework. The first level of analysis establishes whether sustainable activities are taking place within the regions and provides the data needed to perform the second and third level of analysis. The presence of sustainable activities is determined by the policy areas found in the regions. The analysis assumes that each policy area is equally important in contributing to sustainability, and though this is a shortcoming, as each policy area might not contribute equally, this approach was used in previous sustainability studies (Portney, 2002). The research's literature review found no consistent way of weighting sustainable measures in their overall contribution towards achieving sustainability (Abolina and Zilans, 2002; Berke and Manta Conroy, 2000; Conroy, 2006; Jepson, 2004; Parkinson and Roseland, 2002; Portney, 2002; Saba and Paterson, 2008; Tsenkova and Damiani, 2009). The main focus of this research is to select policy areas that address unsustainable practices in the GGH and align the policy areas to the scope of the Regional Official Plans, which is further explained in the Sustainability Framework section. As the first level of analysis was based on the researcher's inference of the regional policies content, which was informed by a literature review of sustainability studies and

20

frame\yorks, and by a content analysis method (Leech and Omvuegbuzie, 2007; Rime et at., 2005; Rihoux, 2006; Woodrum, 1984), the researcher performed a reliability test to ensure that the coded data in the first level of analysis was trustworthy. The reI iability method and results are described in Chapter 2 in the Reliability section.

The Sustai.nability Framework
This research project uses sustainable strategies, theories, principles, previous sustainability studies, and unsustainable practices in urbanized regions in a developed country to inform the development of a sustainability framework (Berke and Manta Conroy, 2000; Chakrabarty, 2001; Conroy, 2006; Dale, 2001; Hempel, 1996; Hodge, 1997; Hofmann, 2000; Jepson, 2004; Parkinson and Roseland, 2002; Pierce and Dale, 1999; Portney, 2002; Robinson, 2006; Robinson, 2008; Robinson and Legge, 1990; Saba and Paterson, 2008; Schor and Taylor, 2003; TarasofslJ', 2006; United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Division of Sustainable Development, 2009). The framework is applied to Regional Official Plan policies in order to assess the regions' policies and whether they have laid a foundation towards becoming more sustainable. This research selected 20 policy areas from the literature review, which form a sustainability framework (see Table 1 for the list of policy areas in the sustainability framework). The policy areas that were selected consider the division of responsibilities that exists between the provincial, regional and municipal governments to ensure that only policy strategies that the regional and municipal governments can lead on or substantially contribute to were selected (Table 1 identifies the governmental division of responsibility by policy area). The framework's policies also concentrate on land-planning strategies in order to align with the scope of the Regional Official Plan. A Regional Official Plan houses municipal council's policies on how land should be used in a community (Government of Ontario, 1990a).

21

The sustainability framework consists of ten policy areas that support human and nonhuman environment. It consists of five policies that support sustainable economic development and five policies that support sustainable social development. Table 1: Sustainability Framework Policy Areas

Policy area selection was also based on sustainability issues experienced in an urban area in a developed country. As mentioned earlier, environmental degradation is wide-spread in industrialized countries (Boyd and Suzuki, 2008), and with Canada's high gross domestic

24

product (GOP), which indicates a relatively high standard of living (Human Resources and Skills Development Canada., 2010) - these are the main reasons for choosing a framework that predominantly consists of policy areas that contribute to environmental sustainability. Based on a literature review, this research views sustainability as a dynamic state that balances the three imperatives of sustainability (Berke and Manta Conroy, 2000), and the presence of a higher number of environmentally sustainable policy areas will shift the focus to environmental protection and provide an opportunity to balance GGH's environmental objectives with its strong economic and social systems. Previous sustainability studies based their analyses on a larger number of policy areas than this research: Saha and Paterson (2008) had thirty-six policy areas while Portney (2002) has thirty-four. This research's policy areas were restricted by the legislation and governmental responsibilities as discussed earlier. Without any restrictions, policy areas of Brownfield redevelopment, agriculture protect zoning, right to farm legislation and tax shift from labor and income to resource consumption would provide a more comprehensive policy analysis of communities' contributions towards achieving sustainability (Conroy, 2006; Jepson, 2004; Portney, 2002; Saha and Paterson, 2008; Schor and Taylor, 2003).

Policy Integration Analysis The second level of analysis is derived from an environmental policy integration (EPI) framework developed by Runhaar et al. (2008). A policy integration framework like the EPI is a tool that helps recognize whether policy integration exists between policies in different sustainability pillars, for example, whether policies under economic development are integrated with environmental protection policies. In addition, a policy integration frame\vork is used to determine whether policies are mutually supportive in helping achieve sustainability as well as providing insight into what elements of sustainability are integrated

25

and to what degree-that is, it determines if elements are integrated but not on equal terms. integrated on equal terms, or one element is prioritized over another (Lafferty and Hovden, 2003: Runhaar et al., 2009). According to Lafferty and Hovden (2003), one of the key defining features of sustainable development is the emphasis on the integration of the sustainability elements with each other and \vith other policy sectors. Lafferty and Hovden (2003) and Runhaar et at. (2009) focus on integrating environmental objectives into nonenvironmental policy sectors, which aligns to the higher presence of policy areas in the sustainability framework that focus on environmental sustainability. There are three integration fonus within the EPI framework: coordination, hanuonization and prioritization. The EPI forms are expanded in this research to consider social and economic integration, as EPI focuses on environmental integration into non-environmental policy sectors (Runhaar et al., 2(09). The three modifi ed fonus of integration are: 1. Coordination, \vhich integrates more than one imperative of sustain ability, though they are not integrated on equal tenus. For example, environmental and economic elements are integrated but environmental objectives are compromised by economic development. This fonu is considered limited in its integration abilities (Runhaar et al.,2009). 2. Harmonization, v.,hich is an attempt to put all of the imperatives of sustainability on equal terms. Examples inc1ude mixing spatial functions in order to minimize car movements or influencing public choices of transport by situating public transport close by and so that residents with different financial and social needs have easy access (Runhaar et at. 2009). 3. Prioritization, which favours one of the three imperatives of sustainability over the other two. For example, reserving areas for nature or smart growth to safeguard
26

against urbanization. The precautionary principle, which is based on preventing the emergence of sources of environmental degradation, is also considered a prioritization form of integration (Runhaar et al., 2009). This research applies the three forms to regional policies in order to assess the level of integration exhibited by the regional policies. The regional policies for each policy area identified during the first level of analysis are reviewed to determine the integration form or forms the policies exhibit. As in the first level of analysis, the researcher's inference of the regional policies content determines the integration form or forms associated with each policy area Due to the small number of policy areas in the sustainability framework a reliability test to determine whether the integration form or forms that was associated to the policy area due to chance or error was not performed.

Regional Comparative Analysis

The third level is a comparative policy analysis to examine the differences in policies between comparable regional governments that can impact the progress towards achieving sustainability. It provides insight into the policy tools used to achieve the same objective as well as revealing the strengths and weaknesses that each municipality brings towards achieving sustainability. Case similarities are discussed in detail in the next section. The objective of the regional comparative analysis is to leam about policy directives from sustainably advanced communities that support sustainable development and exhibit characteristics oftaking sustainability seriously_ The last level of analysis will examine whether any additional directions exist in the regional policies that were not identified in the previous levels of analyses, but can contribute (positively and negatively) towards sustainability .

27

Case selection.
A small number of cases were selected for this research due to the detailed nature of the analysis. Qualitative comparative analysis supports the small-N approach and the need to consider each individual case as a complex entity that should be comprehended as a \vhole (Rihoux, 2006). Comparative analysis usually evaluates between two and ten cases (Collier, 1991); this study has two cases. Lijphart suggests that where there are few cases, the cases selected should be comparable (as cited in Collier, 1991). This study focuses on cases with similar political and environmental context as well as similar community characteristics, which were found to contribute to how seriously a community undertakes sustainability efforts (Portney, 2002). In study of 25 American cities pursuing sustainability, Portney

(2002) concluded that cities with a higher than average number of citizens less than 18 years, a low presence of manufacturing services, a higher median age of residents, and communities \\lth a higher percentage of high school graduates are likely to take sustainability more seriously (Portney, 2002). Table 2 provides regional profile and characteristics identified by Portney (2002) of the two cases selected: York and Peel. The regions of York and Peel were also selected because of their similarities when it comes to the proximity to each other and to the largest city in Ontario, Toronto (see Appendix B for the map of York and Peel regions, and their location within the GOH and proximity to the city of Toronto) (Ministry of Public Infrastructure Renewal, 2006; Region of Pee], 2009; Region of York, 2009, Statistics Canada, 2009).

In addition, both regions used a similar review planning process when conforming their Regional Official Plans to the Places to Grow Act. The process of community planning to review the recent Regional Official Plans was viewed through a lens of sustainability. Each region has its
O\vTI

sustainability framework. For Peel, "[tJhe over-arching theme of ... [Peel's

Regional Official} Plan is sustainability which refers to meeting the needs of the present 'without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Regional Council will work towards sustainability by applying a sustainable development framework, \vhich will provide a holistic approach to planning, action and measurement" (Region of Peel, 2009,5), vv'here a " ... sustainable development framework enables integration of the environmental, social, economic and cultural imperatives throughout the Plan" (Region of Peel, 2009, 6). York's Regional Official Plan, meanwhile, states that "[slustainability is the lens through which York Region formulates, enhances and implements policy. The awardwinning York Region Sustainability Strategy: Towards a Sustainable Region provides a long term framework for making smarter decisions about all municipal responsibilities that fully evaluates economic, environmental and community considerations" (Region of York, 2009, 1).

29

Lastly, the reason for regional level comparison is that only single and upper-tier governments were supposed to conform their Official Plans to the Places to Grow Act by the provincial deadline of June 2009 (K. Ryan, personal communication, December 18, 2008). This research concentrates on the Places to Grow Act a<; the framework, and objecti\'es of the

Places 10 Grow Act support the concept and systems that contribute to achieving
sustainability (Ministry of Public Infrastructure Renewal, 2006).

Reliability.
To ensure the coded data are reliable and trustworthy, the researcher repeated the coding protocol applied in the first level of analysis. Rime et al. (2005) indicate that the most appropriate reliability test for a single coder is to measure the coding differences at h\'o points in time. The first coding session took place between May 15 and May 22, 2010, and the second coding session took place on June 22 and 23, 2010. Since inter-coder reliability is the most recommended approach (Berke and Manta Conroy, 2000; Rime et al., 2005) as the chance of accidentally agreeing decreases as the number of coders increases, the researcher decided to take on a larger sample size to re-code than the 10% sample needed to achieve a 95% confidence level (Rime et al., 2005). A large sample of 50% of the 1274 policies in the York and Peel's Regional Official Plans were re-coded to increase the accuracy of the data coded by a single coder. This research selected Scott's Pi, which is one of the most frequently used reliability tests (Rime et al., 2005). Scott's Pi corrects for chance agreement in reliability assessment by looking at the actual usage of every policy area in the sample and uses that distribution to calculate probability for chance agreement (Riffe et aI., 2005). The observed agreement is determined at 0.89 while the expected agreement at 0.86, which indicates an adequate reliability, as it is above 0.8, though an expected agreement as low as

30

0.667 could be acceptable for research that is complex and exploratory (Riffe et al., 2005 cited in Krippendorff, 2004).

Most of the disagreements were the result of assigning a single policy area to a regional policy that had multiple directives during the first coding session. The remaining small number of disagreements resulted from human error; during the first coding session, some regional policies were missed and no policy area was assigned until the second coding session. The results from the second coding analysis were used to perform the second and third level of analysis, that is, policy integration and regional comparative analysis.

31

Chapter 3: Analysis and Findings
An exploratory analysis was W1dertaken to examine York and Peers recently conformed Regional Official Plans in order to determine whether they are moving towards sustainability, The analysis consists of a sustainability framework designed to support an urban area in a developed COW1try, and comprises three levels of analysis using a detailed comparative qualitative content analysis. The first level of analysis determines the presence of sustainable activities within the regions using the sustainability framework, and obtains a holistic view of the regional policies. The second level of analysis assesses whether regional policies integrate the sustainability imperatives or take a piecemeal approach to sustainability. The third level of analysis compares the regions ofY ork and Peel's policy actions tov.'ards achieving sustainability.

This chapter discusses the analysis and findings for each policy area within the sustainability framework. The three pillars of the sustainability framework also organize the discussion, and they are economic sustainability, environmental sustainability and social sustainability. Table 3: The Presence of Sustainable Activities summarizes the findings from the first level of analysis by region and policy area.

The policy numbers predominantly from Peel and York's Regional Official Plans but also from the Places to Grow Act are referred to during the discussion in order to provide specific examples, and for the most part they are captured in brackets. Policy numbers identified in the analysis section are examples of policies that either support or oppose a specific policy area and do not represent a complete policy analysis (see Appendix C for Peel's detailed policy analysis and Appendix D for York's).

32

The discussion of the analysis and findings attempts to provide insight into whether the regions are moving forward towards sustainability. As mentioned earlier, the regions are mandated to review their Official Plans every five years, thus opening themselves to the possibility of missing the opportunity to take appropriate policy actions in order to move towards sustainability. This research fills the five-year gap by providing an ex ante evaluation of whether the regions' have laid a foundation towards achieving sustainable development.

Policy Areas - Economic Sustainability
The economic imperative in sustainability concentrates on financial growth and profit (ICLEI, IDRC and UNEP, 1996). The policy areas that were identified as supporting the economic imperative, when viewed through a lens of sustainability, concentrate on managing growth in a sustainable manner (Berke and Manta Conroy, 2000; Conroy, 2006; Jepson,
2004; Portney. 2002; Saha and Paterson, 2008). Sustainable gro\\th is usually associated with

the concept of smart growth, which directs the community to avoid urban sprawl by directing economic development and population growth in such a way as to reduce the impact on the natural environment (Portney, 2002). The five policy areas under the economic pillar of sustainability were selected because they address GGH issues of urban sprawl and growing population (Ministry of Public Infrastructure Renewal, 2006),

Urban Growth Boundary
The urban growth boundary policy area concentrates on policies that establish lines around communities in order to apply zoning regulations that restrict urban development to the areas inside the lines (Jepson, 2004; Saha and Paterson, 2008). This policy area has been designated as a smart growth policy under the economic development initiative in previous sustainability studies (Saha and Paterson, 2008). As mentioned earlier, smart gro\\1h contributes to sustainability as it allows the economy and population to grow by reducing the gro,\th's impact on the environment (Portney, 2002). The provincial government, which is responsible for natural resources and the environment, has defined urban areas in the Places to Grow Act's gro'Mh plan for the GGH as areas that ,,,ill "accommodate a significant share of population and employment gro,\th" (Ministry of Public Infrastructure Renewal, 2006, 16). ThePlaces to Grow Act mandated that regional governments define urban boundaries in their Regional Official Plans and their

34

municipalities' Local Official Plans, and direct a significant amount of growth inside the boundaries (Ministry of Public Infrastructure Renewal, 2006). Regional governments are responsible for strategic land-use planning in Ontario, and along with local municipalities \vho plan and develop communities, regional governments are in a position to define and implement the urban gro'wth boundary policy area (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2010). Both regions' Regional Official Plans have policies that establish boundaries to contain growth around urban and rural areas. For example, the region of Peel has established boundaries for built up areas, designated greenfield areas (5.5.3.2.1), employment lands \\1thin urban and rural areas (5.6.2.1) and core areas of the Greenland System (5.3.2.1). Within urban areas, lines were established around urban growth centres, intensification corridors, urban nodes, major transit station areas (5.5.3.2.5 and 5.5.3.2.6) and the urban system (5.3.2.1) (Region of Peel, 2009). Refer to the Glossary for the definitions of these areas, corridors, centres and nodes. The regions direct a significant portion of grovv1h within urban areas and limit the growth in rural areas. York's Regional Official Plan recognizes urban areas (6.2.2), regional centres and corridors (5.4.1, 5.4.19, 5.4.30), and local regional centres and corridors (5.5.1) as areas where the most intensive development will take place (Region of York, 2009), while limiting gro,\o1h or prohibiting major developments in rural areas (5.6.22, 5.6.23, 5.6.24). Expansion of established areas are permitted in both the Places to Grow Act and York and Peel's Regional Official Plans, though it is allowed only through a municipal comprehensive review or similar type of analysis. Policy 2.2.8 in the growth plan for the GGH, and policies 5.2.2.3 in Peel and 5.1.1.2 in York, are examples of the policies that support urban gro\\o1h boundary expansion. According to the Places to Grow Act, and York (5.2.2.3,5.4.4.2.2,5.5.3.2.8,5.5.4.2.4) and Peers (5. L 12, 5.4.35) Regional Official Plans, a

35

municipal comprehensive review or similar type of analysis needs to consider the long-term use of the expanded area, the impact of expansion on the region's intensification and density targets, the protection of environmentally sensitive and significant lands, and the infrastructure available in the expanded area. The fact that the province and regions allow these areas to be expanded shows sound planning and an unsustainable practice at the same time. It is a sound approach as there is always a level of uncertainty attached to any forecast in community planning (Region of York, 201 Ob; Hodge. 1997). Although York, Peel and the Places to Grow Act require 11 municipal comprehensive analysis that questions the expansion's impact on smart growth and significant environmental areas, the Places to Grow Act dictates that the boundaries can be expanded to include agricultural operations as long as the impact on the agricultural lands are mitigated (Ministry of Public Infrastructure Renewal. 2006). This approach exhibits characteristics of an integration form of coordination, which limits the integration of environmental objectives. Environmental objectives, in this case, are the protection of the natural environment from being lost to urban expansion and the community's ability to produce its own food. The impact on the GGH's agricultural operations should be minimal, as York makes up 1.7% and Peel makes up 0.84% of the total farms in Ontario (Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural, 2010). However, allowing such expansion supports unsustainable practices as it takes away from the community's self-reliance and puts local food security at risk, as well as contributing to further loss of lands due to human expansion. Society's long-term survival and a community's self-reliance is not dependent upon development but on the biological wealth and its ability to support human and nonhuman life (leLEI, IDRe and UNEP, 1996; Dale, 2001).

36

As municipalities have been working to comply with the Greenbelt Act and Places to

Grow Act, it has been determined that less than 35% of the "whitebelt" will be needed for
future development (Ontario Greenbelt Alliance, 2010), According to the Ontario Greenbelt Alliance (2010), the whitebelt is an unprotected area of prime foodland and green space, and the region of York views these lands as development opportunities and currently plans to develop on them (Region of York, 201Ob). There are numerous debates regarding York's expansion into the whitebelt area, and time will tell what decision the government will make. However, the current policy and debate show signs of contradictions, which limits the community's ability to achieve sustainability. The analysis found that the urban growth boundary policy area in the regions of York and Peel exhibit all three forms of integration. Coordination was discussed earlier, and the second integration form, prioritization, is evident in policies that reserve a particular area in order to direct growth inside of the area. These policies prioritize sustainable economic objectives, which the Greater Vancouver Regional District considers an effective tool to sustainably manage land (Urban Strategies Inc., 2005). The integration form of harmonization is also present, as both regions consider other sustainability-focused policy areas when establishing the boundary lines or managing the uses and growth inside them, such as smart development in York policy 4.4.4, and, density and intensification targets in Peel policy 5.5.3.2.4. In addition, York incorporates affordable housing and transport demand management policies when determining regional centres and corridors (5.4.12). This inclusion of other policy areas in the urban growth boundary policies can integrate economic, social and environmental objectives when planning a community to manage gro\\th sustainably.

37

Smart Development
The policy area of smart development provides official planning and zoning provisions that permit integrated development projects characterized by mixed uses, high densities, centralized common areas, distributed and easily accessible open spaces, health care and recreation facilities, and an integrated system of walkways, bikeways and transit (Jepson, 2004). The smart development policy area supports the urban gro\\-1h boundary as it encourages building compact urban communities within the boundaries, and therefore aligns it with the smart gro\\1h concept (Jepson, 2004; Conroy, 2006~ Portney, 2002). The Places to

Grow Act's growth plan dictates that the GGH will consist of communities that are compact,
complete and can meet people's daily needs (Ministry of Public Infrastructure Renewal,

2006). Ontario's regions have the ability and accountability to implement the smart
development policy area, as they are responsible for strategic land-use planning, and their municipalities are responsible for local planning and development (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2010). The Regional Official Plans in both communities have policies that satisfy most of the smart development provisions. York requires its municipalities to permit mixed uses and higher densities (5.4.15,5.4.20) in its regional centres, and Peel requires the same in its urban growth centres (5.3.3.2.3). Both regions have provisions for common areas, open spaces and services that are easily accessible, which is a requirement in the smart development policy area (Peel 5.5.2.1; York 3.1.5, 5.4.6, 5.4.25, 5.6.15, 5.6.8). In addition, York policies 5.4.5 and 4.4.4, and Peel's 5.3.3.2.3 and 5.3.2.6, provide provisions to ensure that pedestrian and transit-oriented designs are incorporated into community designs. The region of Peel has no policies that support bike-oriented designs, while York supports bike-oriented designs in regional centres (5.4.5), local centres (5.5.3) and in retail-specific areas (4.4.1).

38

The region of Peel encourages its local municipalities to incorporate policies in their Local Official Plan that ,viII develop communities with a range and mix of employment and housing types, high-quality public open spaces and easy access to retail and services (5.5.2.1) Although York requires its local municipalities to include all smart development zoning provisions in the Local Official Plan, it also encourages secondary and subdivision plans within the designated greenfield area be developed with smart development provisions (5.2.16). Berke and Manta Conroy's (2000) methodology of evaluating the extent to which plans promote sustainable development consider whether the policy was "suggested" or "required." Suggested policies received a lower score than the required policies in promoting sustainable development. As the two regions were selected as case studies in order to control for political and environmental factors, there should be no difference in which polices are suggested and which are required other than a choice in their policy tools to implement Regional and Local Official Plans. Lastly, both regions have considered smart development provisions in other policy areas, such as urban growth bourldary, density and intensification targets, transport demand management and pedestrian access plans. Having mixed use and public spaces, for instance, in policy areas that are not primarily concerned with designating the use of space can make a community more sustainable, as it incorporates smart development in other community decisions. The regional policies exhibit harmonization integration, as they create urban designs that allow communities to adapt a more sustainable lifestyle. The policies show signs of treating environmental and economic objectives equally. As an example, an environmental objective can be to reduce GHG, which smart development provisions can achieve by reducing communities' reliance on vehicles by locating places of employment and residences in close proximity to transit. An economic objective can be for communities to continue to grow in a sustainable manner.

39

Eco-Industrial Parks An eeo-industrial park is "[a] community of businesses that coHaborate with each other and with the local community to efficiently share resources (information, materials, water, energy, infrastructure and natural habitat), leading to economic gains, gains in environmental quality, and equitable enhancement of human resources for the business and local community" (Lambert and Boons, 2001, 472). An eeo-industrial park policy sets aside "Jand for development and sale to companies that collaborate to enhance their economic performance through improved environmental performance through the conversion of wastes into valuable inputs, the cogeneration of energy, and the minimize of material throughput" (Jepson, 2004, 239). Ontario regions and municipalities have the ability to contribute to designing ceo-industrial parks, as they are responsible for strategic land use, land division consent application, water and wastewater services, solid waste management, and building inspection and design (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2010). The Places to Grow Act's growth plan for the GGH and Regional Official Plans did not have any policies explicitly supporting this policy area According to Ray Cote, a founding director at the Eco-Efficiency Centre at Dalhousie University in Halifax, "[m]unicipalities are just really scratching the surface in terms of requiring features that conserve resources and so on ... If we wanted to, we could pass bylaws and identify guidelines to require developers to pay attention to those things, but it needs to start '"'lith the municipalities. And they still need educating" (Mitharn, 2009, 2). Although, eco-industrial park policies are not explicitly defined in Regional Official Plans, Clay Braziller, who manages business development and marketing for Eco-Industrial Solutions Ltd., a Vancouver-based company specializing in eco-industrial planning and development, believes they will be soon, as municipalities face restrictions on grow1h through legislations like the

40

Places to Grow Act and Greenbelt Act (Mitham, 2009). The region of Peel and some of its
local municipalities support the Partners in Project Green, a project planned for 27,500 acres surrounding Toronto Pearson International Airport. It is the largest eco-industrial project currently planned for Canada (GTAA Partners in Project Green, 2010; Mitham, 2009). Since this research relies on the content of policies to perform an analysis, the absence of more descriptive policies regarding eco-industrial parks prevents the use of the coding protocol, EPI framework and comparative analysis.

Purchase of Development Rights
A number of sustainability studies consider this policy area, which allows municipalities to purchase development rights from landowners that reside on environmentally sensitive or significant lands, as one of the more significant policy directions to sustainable development (Berke and Manta Conroy,
2000~

Jepson, 2004; Saba and

Paterson 2008). The regions and local municipalities have the responsibility to strategically plan land use, process land division consent applications, and manage the planning and development of a community, and are able to contribute to this policy area (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2010). In addition, the regions are supported by provincial legislation that focuses on environmental protection and sustainable land management, such as the Greenbelt Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Act and PrOVincial Policy Statement (Government of Ontario 2001, 2005b; Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2005). Both York and Peel's Regional Official Plans have policies allowing the municipalities to purchase lands for areas that have received special conservation designation. York's purchase rights have a goal of protecting the regional Greenland System, which contains key natural heritage and hydrologic features, and the adjacent lands necessary to maintain these features (2.1.16). The region is not obligated to purchase these lands but the option is available

41

(2.1.17). The region of Peel also allows the securement of natural areas but the purchasing of
land is suggested as a last resort, \vith preference given to planning policy, stewardship and monitoring (2.6.2.1,2.6.2.5). As both regions' key natural areas have been identified and protected in the Regional Official Plans under the identifY and protect the environment policy area., this policy area offers further options to sustainably manage environmentally significant and sensitive areas that are privately owned. The regional policies regarding purchasing development rights exhibit the harmonization integration form, as they enhance the effectiveness of the policy that prioritizes environmental protection by identifYing environmentally sensitive and significant areas and protecting them from development.

Density and Intensification Targets
Policies that establish minimum density and intensification targets for residential, industrial and commercial zones not only lead to the preservation of lands outside the urban grO\\111 areas but to a reduction in the fuel consumption needed for transportation associated with low density housing (S. de Wilde, 2004). The regional government can contribute to achieving this policy area by strategically planning land use and through the issuance of building permits, which are defined and approved by local municipalities (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2010). York and Peel have policies to establish density and intensification targets that meet or exceed the requirements found in the Places to Grow Act's gro\\111 plan for the GGH. Both regions have considered the density and intensification targets in their smart development, urban growth boundary, and transport demand management policy areas, and have integrated density decisions into other parts of community planning and triggered "a shift in business-

42

as-usual development towards the more compact development" (Urban Strategies Inc., 2005,
9).

Ontario's intensification target of 40% is still lower than other jurisdictions in Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia, \vhich aim for 60% to 80% intensification (Urban Strategies Inc, 2005). In order to maximize the 40% target, the Places to Grow Act applies the intensification rate to specific areas within the region, such as built up areas, rather than applying them region-\vide (Ministry of Public Infrastructure Renewal, 2006; Urban Strategies Inc, 2005). Lower intensification rates are detrimental to becoming more sustainable, although these are much higher than the regions' existing intensification levels of 20%. (Urban Strategies Inc., 2005). The established density targets align with urban areas in London, Paris and Amsterdam (S. de Wilde, 2004). In addition, York's floor space indexes of2.5 to 3.5 per developable area in their regional centres and corridors (5.4.33) are higher overall than similar areas in European cities. Case studies in Europe have revealed that a high floor-space index is more easily achievable for a mono-functional office area than for a functionally diverse area with, for examples, apartments and retail (S. de Wilde, 2004). York's developable areas include residential and employment uses, open space and infrastructure; their floor space indexes are ambitious and reaching them will ensure that compact communities are being developed in the GGH (Region ofYork, 2009). The provincial and regional density and intensification targets exhibit both prioritization and harmonization. Prioritization is seen in the density targets and intensification rates defined in the policies, as they favour smart gro'wth objectives to allow communities to grow in a sustainable manner. Harmonization is also reflected because the smart gro'wth concept considers environmental objectives in preventing losing lands to urban

43

expansions. In addition, regional policies consider transport demand management in this policy area further supporting environmental and economic objectives equally.

Policy Areas - Environmental Sustain ability
Environmental sustainability is one of the three distinct development processes taking place at the local level. Each of the three processes-economic development, community development and environmental deve1opment-has its own unique imperatives. Environmental sustainability involves protecting ecosystems and promoting settlements that reduce environmental degradation (Dale, 2001; Hempel, 1996; ICLEI, IDRC and UNEP, 1996). The policies listed in the category of environmental sustainability in the sustainability framework allow communities to support environmental development by limiting the consumption of natural resources and by reducing the production of waste, with the ultimate goal of reducing consumption to a rate that allows nature to regenerate resources and reducing waste production to levels that can be absorbed by the environment (lCLEI, IDRC and UNEP, 1996).

Identify and Protect the Environment
The identify and protect the environment policy area concentrates on establishing it systematic identification and strategic protection of environmentally sensitive and biologically significant open spaces in the region, as well as the corridors that connect them, by prohibiting development in these spaces (Jepson, 2004). Snha and Paterson's (2008) survey panel and literature review recognize this policy area as one of the most significant policies to achieve sustainability. The regions of York and Peel are rich in natural resources, containing portions of the Oak Ridges Moraine and the Niagara Escarpment, which are United Nations Educational,

44

Scientific Cultural Organization's World Biosphere Reserve (Region of Peel, 201Oa), as well as the regional Greenland System, which contains key natural heritage hydrologic features (Region of York, 2009). The province of Ontario with the po\vers over the natural resources and the environment has issued legislation, such as the Greenbelt Act, the Oak Ridges

Moraine Act, the Lake Simcoe Protection Act and the Provincial Policy Statement, that has
contributed to establishing a systematic identification and strategic protection of environmentally sensitive and biologically significant open spaces. Regional Official Plans have identified significant and sensitive areas and their corridors (Peel 2.2.10.4.12, 2.2.9.3.1, 2.3.2.9; York 2.1.11,2.2.1,2.2.24) in conforming with provincial legislation. The regions also have policies to continue to identifY, refine and verifY environmentally sensitive and biologically significant spaces through studies and the establishment and maintenance of environmental management databases (Peel 2.2.2.2, 2.2.2.3; York 2.1.27,2.2.12). The list of environmental areas that have been identified as significant and sensitive is extensive but the key areas include the regional Greenland System, key natural heritage features, key hydrologic features, woodlands, wetlands, the Oak Ridges Moraine, the Greenbelt area, and Lake Simcoe. Both regions are committed to protecting, maintaining, enhancing and restoring environmentally sensitive and biologically significant open spaces and the corridors that connect them (Peel 2.1.3.2, 2.5.2.1; York 2.1.7). There are pockets of land designated for protection where development or land-uses are prohibited, but for the most part development and various uses are allowed in protected areas as long as proper studies, assessments and approvals that involve various authorities and meet provincial requirements like the

Greenbelt Act are satisfied (Peel 2.3.2.22, 3.2.2.7; York 2.1.8,2.1.22,6.2.9). For example,
Peel prohibits new or expanded mineral aggregate extraction sites, wayside pits and quarries, or any ancillary or accessory uses in the core areas of the Greenlands System (3.3.2.3), while

45

York prohibits batching and asphalt plants, and new waste disposal sites anywhere in the Greenland System (2.1.23). Peel's core areas inel ude significant wetlands, core \voodlands, prOVIncial natural areas, habitats of threatened and endangered species, core valleys and streams, and escarpment natural areas (Regional of Peel, 2009). There were only two instances \vhere policies mitigated environmental impacts in the protected areas. The first is 'within York's Lake Simcoe watershed: the "development or site alteration is to avoid, minimize and/or mitigate impacts associated with the quality and quantity ofurhan nm-offinto receivmg streams, lakes and wetlands" (2.2.22). The second instance is for development of wildlife management projects or passive recreation in the core areas of Peel's Greenland System (2.3.2.5). Out of the 304 policies found in both regions' Official Plans that focus on environment, the presence of coordination, is very low. Regional policies appear to show a preference for applying the precautionary principle by requiring environmental studies and assessments as part of development or site alteration requests in protected areas. The precautionary principle is "Where an activity raises threats of harm to the environment or human health, precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically" - this way the proponent of the activity not the public hears the burden of proof (Global Development Research Centre, 1998). The EPI framework recognizes the precautionary principle as a fonn of prioritization that favours environmental objectives (Runhaar et al. 2009). On the other hand, the assessments and studies that need to be done could also exhi bit coordination, as classification depends on the expectations and the direction of the assessment and the studies, \\'hich was not part of the scope of this research.

46

Urban FOI'estry

The urban forestry policy area supports municipal strategies of planting and maintaining trees with the specific goal of reducing carbon emissions and energy expenditures for heating and cooling (Jepson, 2004). Researchers have reported that greener urban landscapes provide numerous environmental, social and economic benefits by moderating temperature, improving air quality, controlling flooding, causing residents to become more emotionally attached to their communities, and increasing property values (Payton et al., 2008 cited in Heynen and Lindsey, 2003). Along with their local municipalities, regions are empowered to develop urban forests through planning land use and creating bylaws to manage parks and recreation areas (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2010). The regions of Peel and York have policies to develop urban forest management plans and strategies (Peel 2.5.2.9; York 2.2.46). The regions are currently involved in conducting urban forest studies that place a monetary and ecological value on the functions of the urban forest, considering factors such as carbon storage, pollutant uptake or the mitigation of energy use. These studies are meant to provide a foundation for the development of the Urban Forest Management Plans (Region of York, 201Oa). As this research relies on the content of the policies to perform an analysis, the absence of more descriptive policies regarding the urban forestry plans prevents the use of a coding protocol,

EPI framework and comparative analysis.
Energy Conservation

The energy conservation policy area has had a strong presence in previous sustainability studies (Conroy, 2006; Jepson, 2004; Parkinson and Roseland, 2000; Portney, 2002; Saha and Paterson, 2008) and was identified by Saha and Paterson's (2008) survey

47

panel and literature review as one of the policies that is most significant to achieving sustrunability, as it limits the consumption of natural resources and reduces pollution emitted from the use of non-renewable sources like coal and fossil fueL This policy area consists of strategies that focus on energy efficiency measures, including energy conservation efforts, the use of renewable energy like solar and \\ind, and the green building program (Conroy. 2006; Jepson, 2004; Parkinson and Roseland, 2000; Portney, 2002; Saba and Paterson, 2008). The green building program requires new residential units to achieve substantial reductions in energy and material consumption during both construction and operation (Jepson, 2004). The province of Ontario is introducing a culture of energy conservation through the

Places to Grow Act, the Energy Conservation Responsibility Act in 2006, and the new Green Energy Act in 2008. The Places to Grow Act requires municipalities to design buildings and
lands that are energy efficient and reduce consumption, as well as to identify opportunities for alternative energy generation and distribution (Ministry of Public Infrastructure Renewal, 2006). The Energy Conservation Responsibility Act requires government ministries, agencies and broader public sector organizations to prepare energy conservation plans and report on energy consumption. The Energy Responsibility Act should provide visibility . into . communities' shift towards a cuhure of conservation and offer information that can be used to further plan energy-conscious communities (Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, 20IOb). The Green Energy Act, which is meant to invest in renewable energy projects and further increase conservation, has established energy efficiency standards for a \\ide range of energy·using products, \,tith the objective of eliminating the least energy-efficient products from the Ontario marketplace (Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, 2010b). The regions have aligned their Regional Official Plans to support provincial energy conservation legislation through a variety of approaches, including the use of green roofs and

48

urban canopy trees, various alternative energy systems such as solar and geothermal energies. and energy conservation plans (Peel 3.7.2.1, 3.7.2.3, 3.7.2.6; York 5.4.6, 5.4.24). The key difference between the two regions is that York requires its local municipalities to increase building efficiencies (5.2.8, 5.2.20, 5.2.42) while Peel's policies encourage local municipalities to incorporate policies on energy-efficient buildings into Local Official Plans (3.7.2.2). As discussed earlier, Berke and Manta Conroy's (2000) methodology of suggested versus required policies affects the movement towards achieving sustainability. Ontario's policies regarding energy conservation have characteristics of harmonization (integrating economic and environmental objectives) due to the energy conservation choices available to the community, from energy-efficient products, which support economic development, to energy conservation land and building designs, which directly preserve the environment.

'Vater Source Protection and Water Conservation

The water source protection and water conservation policy area consists of two parts: policies that concentrate on protecting water resources and policies that focus on conserving water use. This policy area, like energy conservation, has a strong presence in previous sustainability studies (Conroy, 2006; Parkinson and Roseland, 2000; Portney, 2002; Saba and Paterson, 2008) and was identified by Saba and Paterson's (2008) survey panel and literature review as one of the policies that is most significant to achieving sustainability. Ontario is rich in surface and groundwater resources, and communities, plants and animals depend on these resources, which consist of four of the five Great Lakes and more than a quarter of a million lakes, rivers and streams (Ministry of Environment, 2009). The province is responsible for natural resources and the environment, and has defined legislation

49

to protect water sources by identifying significant and sensitive water sources as part of Ontario's natural key areas and developing around them (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2010; Mir:istry of Public Infrastructure Renewal, 2006). To protect the water resources, the regions need to comply \vith the provincial legislation discussed in the identify and protect the environment policy area along with the Waler Resources Act (Government of Ontario, 1990b). Each region has a unique set of tools to protect water sources, including prohibiting incompatible uses, directing development from sensitive surface and groundwater features (Peel 5.9.8.2.3; York 2.3.7), and considering the cumulative impact on water resources in all planning initiatives (Peel 3.4.2.6; York 2.3.33). With its culture of water conservation, the Places to Grow Act, coupled \\ith the regions' responsibilities over municipal water supply and wastewater systems, allows the regional government to implement water conservation initiatives (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2010). The policies found in the Regional Official Plans offer a range of strategies and tools to reduce water consumption. In York. comprehensive master environmental servicing plans examine all water systems in a comprehensive and integrated manner to increase efficiencies and ma.ximize water conservation in, among other places, buildings and municipal infrastructure (5.6.11). Peel, meanwhile, collaborates with its municipalities to promote water-efficient technologies in new residential development and redevelopment (5.8.5.2.1). Although both regions have water conservation and water source protection policies, and Peel has measures to restore or enhance degraded water resources (7.6.2.16), York stands out in the water conservation area. York has established water conservation targets above and beyond the Ontario Building Code while Peel has an overall goal of reducing per capita consumption over the next 20 years. York requires that all new buildings achieve 10% greater water efficiency (5.2.21) and encourages a 20% greater efficiency than the Ontario Building

50

Code (5.2.23). In addition, York encourages new buildings to be designed and certified to LEED Silver, Gold or Platinum standards (5.2.24). Peel recognizes the need to build beyond the minimum Ontario Building Code provisions (5.8.5.2.3) but does not quantify any building water efficiency standards. Although targets do not guarantee improvements or a path to sustainability, they "build momentum for improvement and accurate performance measurements" and create accountability, which can be maintained through monitoring and reporting (Great Lakes United, 2010, 1). Peel's water efficiency strategy might potentially have another obstacle in sustainable development, its goal to reduce water per capita consumption by 10% to 15% over the next 20 years (6.3.2.9). When assessing Canada's progress in addressing the imperatives set out in the Brundtl and Report, Tarasofskl' (2006) advised that the per capita consumption measure might not be a reliable indicator because as the population grO\vs the per capita consumption does not necessarily increase even though the overall consumption of municipal water does. As mandated by provincial legislation, both regions apply prioritization in the attempt to protect water resources by reserving water-sensitive and significant areas in order to direct development elsev,·here. Protecting water resources is an environmental objective. As discussed in the urban growth boundary and identify and protect the environment policy areas, the regions might practice coordination given the assessments that are performed to determine the impact of land use or development in sensitive areas (Peel 3.4.2.6; York 7.3.41). The requirements of various water studies and risk assessments can determine whether the studies support coordination or prioritization, though the analysis of these studies "vas not part of the scope of this research. These water conservation strategies exhibit characteristics of harmonization in the different options that are offered to conserve water use, which will address the environmental

51

objectives of reducing water consumption and the economic objectives of minimizing the costs associated with expanding water infrastructure.

Integl'ated Waste Management The integrated waste management policy area concentrates on reducing waste generated through recycling, reusing and conservation efforts (Conroy, Portney, 2002;

Saba and Paterson, 2008). This policy area contributes towards a fundamental sustainability goal of reducing waste to levels that can be absorbed by the environment. With direct responsibility over solid and hazardous waste management, diversion, recycling, composting, processing and disposal, the regions have the power to implement integrated waste management in their communities (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2010). The regions' waste management strategies aim to reduce, recycle, reuse and recover all fonns of waste (Peel 6.4.2.1, 7.6.2.20; York: 7.4.1), Their plans include waste diversion (Peel 6.4.2.3; York 7.4,2), investing in energy-from-\\'aste technologies (Peel 6.4.2.9; York 7.4.19), reducing and reusing construction waste (Peel 6.4.2.14; York 5.2.37), looking for new markets for materials from regional waste programs (Peel 6.4.2.7) and supporting waste prevention legislation (York 7.4.3). Both York and Peel have targets in place to divert over 90% and 70%, respectively, of waste from landfills (York 7.4.2) by the year 2016 (Region of Peel, 20 lOa, 2010c). Many GGH municipalities have increased their diversion rates but considering that North. Americans have increased their waste output by more than 80% in the last 40 years (McKay, 2000) and the difficulty Ontario has experienced in siting a landfill (Watt, 2006, November 181), increasing diversion rates might not sufficiently address the regions' waste management problem and position municipalities to achieve sustainability.

52

These regions are positioned to achieve sustainable waste management given that both regions support extended producer responsibility initiatives (Region of Peel, 2010b; Region of York, 2009) and that York encourages the provincial and federal governments to provide comprehensive packaging reduction (7.4.3). York and Peel's integrated waste management policies show characteristics of harmonization by providing various means to manage waste sustainably, slowing dmvn the need for new landfills or other forms of expensive waste disposal systems.

Green Procurement The green procurement policy area looks for municipal contracts that include requirements for vendors to take back packaging and unused materials and products, and that specify environmentally responsible management practices (Jepson, 2004). With the range of services they provide to their communities, such as roads, water, waste management and land planning, regional governments are for the most part in a position to influence the demand for environmentally preferable goods and services, and to change industries' patterns towards becoming more environmentally sustainable (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2010; Public Works and Government Services Canada, 2009). The regions of Peel and York have a number of policies that pursue environmentally responsible purchasing practices for regional operations and services (Peel 5.9.8.2.5, 3.7.2.9; York 7.4.16), and that direct the regions and its contractors to follow socially and environmentally responsible practices (York 7.4.18). Neither of the regions have any explicit requirements for vendors to take back packaging and unused materials and products, but both governments are partners with the Greening Greater Toronto Green Procurement initiative to procure local and greener products and services, and to invest locally in green business and technology sectors (Greening Greater Toronto, 2010).

53

Green procurement regional policies and initiatives demonstrate harmonization. as environmentally and socially responsible practices with a focus on investing in local communities are more likely to equally consider environmental, social and economic objectiyes.

Transportation Demand Management
The transportation demand management policy area consists of policies that encourage the reduction of automobile use through the application of traffic control, public parking, public transit and road strategies (Jepson, 2004). Saha and Paterson's (2008) survey panel and literature review recognized this policy area as one of the policies that is most significant to achieving sustainability. According to Statistics Canada (2006), approximately 75% of residents in the regions of York and Peel use a car as their main mode of transportation, which if left unmanaged ",ill continue to increase traffic congestion, cause demands for more highway infrastructure and continue to deteriorate air quality (Ministry of Public Infrastructure Renewal, 2006). The regions are empowered by the provincial government to offer transportation demand management strategies, as they are responsible for regional roads, transit services and traffic signals, and local municipalities are responsible for parking enforcement (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2010). The regions orYork and Peel have policies, plans and strategies to reduce the use of single-occupancy vehicles, prioritize pedestrians and cyclists, and support public transit (Peel 5.9.2.2; York 3.2.3). Both regions' policies include parking management, carpooling and car sharing spaces, high·occupancy lanes, improving the transit system and development plans that consider transit when building roads (Peel 5.9.9.2.7, 5.9.9.2.2, 5.9.4.2.13; York 5.2.10, 5.4.8, 7.2.41, 7.2.24).

54

Since 2004, the regions of York and Peel, along with other Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area municipalities, have worked with employers to improve and encourage commuting options. Their transport demand management efforts are supported by the central Smart Commute program at Metrolinx, the Ministry of Transportation's Transportation Demand Management Municipal Grant Program and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities' Green Municipal Fund (Federation of Canadian Municipalities, 2009; Ministry of Transportation, 2010). These regional policies and activities exhibit harmonization, as they offer options to reduce communities' reliance on vehicles, which integrates economic and environmental needs.

Pedestrian and Bicycle Access Plans Pedestrian and bicycle access plans policy areas concentrate on an integrated plan of walkways and bicycle lanes for the purpose of improving safety and access to places of employment, home and leisure. These policy areas also look for a separate document that provides a bicycle strategy with an integrated plan of bicycle trails, bike lanes and road crossing that is incorporated with transit support development and transit demand management (Jepson, 2004). Pedestrian and bicycle access plans offer residents choices to incorporate sustainable forms oftransportation into their daily activities (Jepson, 2004). Even though the transportation demand management and smart development policy areas move communities away from relying on single-occupancy vehicles and towards public transit, additional focus is needed on active forms of transportation in order to help communities incorporate bicycle and walking into their lives and change the GGH car-based culture (Environmental Commissioner of Ontario, 2007), as only approximately 3% of residents in York and Peel walk or bike to work (Statistics Canada, 2006). Along with local

55

municipalities, the regions are responsible for strategic land-use planning and the design of communities' streets and sidewalks, allowing them to integrate bicycle and pedestrian plans into community designs (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2010). The ReglOnal Official Plans have policies that integrate bicycle and pedestrian networks into transportation plans, focusing on safety, accessibility and connectivity to recreation, services, employment and transit (Peel 5.9.10.2.1; York 5.6.13). In addition, the regions and their municipalities either have pedestrian and cycling plans or are in the process of developing or re-developing them (Clean Air Partnership, 2010). The pedestrian and bicycle access plans policies exhibit characteristics of harmonization because they incorporate pedestrian and bicycle design when developing other forms of transportation like roads and transit as well as when developing well-connected neighbourhoods (Peel 5.9.10.2.4; York 3.3.5,5.2.3). Well-connected neighbourhoods are part of the smart development policy area and entails making sure buildings and facilities are designed to be located in close proximity to pedestrian, cycling and transit systems, and that pedestrian, cycling and transit facilities are safe and accessible year-round. Public Education or Unsustainable Practices and the Environment This policy strategy looks for policies that raise public awareness or educate about unsustainable practices, sustainable development and environmental protection. It is derived from a literature review that focuses on accepting the need for sustainable development in order to achieve sustainability {Dale, 200l} Sustainable development requires a collective shift of individual actions and political choices (Roseland, 2005). Raising the public's a\vareness is relevant to the collective shift as it addresses the community need to receive better information to allow them to make informed decisions about their daily activities (Environment Canada, 2006), also allowing them to understand how communities need to

56

change in order to move towards sustainability. The regions engage the public using various methods, including public meetings, information centres, open houses, stakeholder workshops, newspapers, the internet and written correspondence (York 8.1.2). The Regional Official Plans' policies focus on raising awareness of water, energy and waste conservation, sustainable transportation, the need for affordable housing and the need to create compact communities (Peel 5.9.2.23,5.9.9.2.5,5.9.10.2.6; York 5.2.40, 7.4.5). Both regions' education policies address two of the three environmentally unsustainable practices that are prevalent in developed countries: housing and transport (Boyd and Suzuki, 2008). These policies demonstrate harmonization, as they provide public awareness of social issues like affordable housing and economic issues like compact communities while also addressing environmental issues, which are their primary focus.

Policy Areas - Social Sustainability

Discussions surrounding sustainable development always conclude that environmental and economic imperatives cannot advance without simultaneously making progress in the social and economic life of civil society (Hempel, 1996; WCED, 1987). Achieving social security, meeting the needs of all individuals, and involving and empowering citizens are some of the key principles for sustainable cities (Ne,\man and Jennings, 2008; Pierce and Dale, 1999; Roseland, 2005). It is therefore necessary to consider sustainable social issues when examining sustainability. Social development needs to distribute benefits equitably and to sustain these benefits for all social groups over the long-term (ICLEI, IDRC and UNEP, 1996). The policy strategies selected in the sustainability framework under the social pillar of sustainability represent areas where Canadian communities are falling behind when compared 'With other countries in the Organization for Economic and Cooperation Development (OECO).

57

Canadians have a high standard of living, with the second highest GDP per capita, an average unemployment rate, the highest proportion of post-secondary graduates, the lowest school drop-out rate and the second highest life expectancy rate, but the rate and persistence of incidences of low income in Canada are higher than the OECD nations' average, and most of these incidences occur in larger urban areas such as the Greater Toronto Area (Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, 2010). According to Statistics Canada (2006), 13% of York's and 14% of Peel's populations spend 20% more than average on food, shelter and clothing, and are considered low income (Statistics Canada, 2001); that's approximately 280,000 residents that may not have the resources to afford food, shelter or other necessities, or to ensure their financial and social security. Policies that ensure low income residents have access to affordable transit and housing can improve their financial and social well-being and support sustainable development efforts.

Affordab1e Transit Access The affordable transit access policy area ensures that communities have policies to subsidize the cost of public transportation and pro\'ide access to buses, subways and trains in order "to help offset the mobility deprivations of the poor" (Pucher, 1982, 39). Saha and Paterson's (2008) survey panel and literature review recognized this policy area as one of the most significant policies in achieving sustainability. Regiona1 governments are empowered to provide affordable transit access, as they are responsible for transit services in their communities (Ministry ofMunicipa1 Affairs and Housing, 2010). As mentioned earlier, Metrolinx is an important partner to the Places to

Grow Act and sustainable transportation. Metrolinx plans to provide service to everyone,
regardless of age, means or ability, although equitable or subsidized transit fare is not

58

mentioned in its strategy plans (Metrolinx, 201 Ob). The region of Peel has no polices to subsidize the public transit system for low income residents. York offers discounts for students and plans to implement an equitable transit fare strategy (7. L 16, 7.2.30). GGH transportation plans concentrate on developing an environmentally sustainable system. These plans are driven by the fact that Canada has the second highest GHG emissions among OECD countries (Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, 2010) and the lack of a transit system increases traffic congestion and urban sprawl (Ministry of Public Infrastructure Renewal, 2006). Although there are signs \vithin these policies and plans to remove transit service barriers to residents \vith low income, there are no policies that describe how the subsidized or equitable transit fare will work. In York, the policies mentioned earlier should support harmonization, integrating social development (increasing the prospects of financial and social security for low income residents) with environmental concerns (supporting sustainable transportation).

Affordable Housing

In Ontario, affordable housing is housing that can be rented or owned at or below the average market value, in many cases at less than 30% of the gross annual household income for low and moderate income households (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2005). Similar to affordable transit access, this policy area ensures the financial and social wellbeing of residents in low income. Saha and Paterson's (2008) study identified this policy area as one of the policies that is most significant in achieving sustainability. In 2000, the province of Ontario passed the Social Housing Reform Act, making regional governments responsible for social housing programs, including non-profit housing (ONPHA, 2010). The regions of York and Peel advocate to the provincial and federal governments the need for funding for affordable housing, and have strategies, frameworks and targets in place to implement

59

affordable housing (Peel 5.8.2.12,5.8.5.2.4,6.2.2.14; York 3.5.6, 35.9, 35. 24). They both offer a variety of tools to support and promote the development and maintenance of affordable housing, including fast-tracking planning approvals for affordable housing projects (Peel 5.8.3.2.2) and working with the private sectors to consider financial arrangements like reduced municipal fees and charges in order to encourage and support the development and maintenance of affordable housing (York 3.S.1O) The key differences between the two regions are that Peel offers more tools to support affordable housing, such as provisions for rent-geared-to-income components within housing program initiatives (6.2.2.18), Income supports for households affected by economic housing barriers (5.8.7.2.4), alternative development standards such as narrow lot sizes, cash in lieu of parking and reduced parking standards (S.8.3.2.3), while York requires affordable housing to meet smart development and intensification requirements (3.5.4). In addition, the regions have different targets-York' s targets for affordable housing are 25% for new housing in each municipality and 35% for new units in regional centres and key development areas (3.5.6, 3.5.7), \vhiIe Peel's target for new units is 17% (5.8.2.12). York shows signs of placing social and economic objectives on equal terms, which is characteristic of harmonization. It considers affordable housing objectives in density and intensification targets policy area under the economic pillar of sustainabil ity. Lastly, Peel's approach to affordable housing does not appear to be connected to other elements of sustainable development.

Cooperative Housing The cooperative housing policy area contains land-use provisions that permit multifamily housing development in which residents have both private and shared spaces under cooperative o\"nership and management (Jepson, 2004). This policy area has been classified

60

under the social development element of sustainability (Saha and Paterson, 2008), as it shares affordable housing's goal of reducing housing costs, and can also result in denser residential development, thus addressing social and environmental objectives of sustainability. In Ontario, cooperative housing is referred to as co-op, which is usually included as part of social or affordable housing, and since the Social Housing Reform Act was passed in 2000 it is a regional responsibility (ONPHA, 2010). The York and Peel Regions do not have any policies with cooperative land-use provisions but there are 17,000 co-op units in the City of Toronto and York Region, some of which are at market value and some of which are subsidized (CHFT, 2010). Peel has general policies that provide housing options to a diverse population based on their preferences and values (5.8.6.2.9, 5.8.6.2.10), and also manages the waiting list for subsidized cooperative housing (Region of Peel, personal communication, July 15,2010). Lastly, Peel has 16 family cooperative providers in the cities ofBrampton and Mississauga (Region of Peel, 20IOa). Cooperative housing exists in the communities but is not explicitly mentioned in the Regional Official Plans.

Climate Change Adaptive and Mitigative PoHcies

Environment Canada's evaluation of the most significant storms in Ontario in the first few years of the twenty-first century has suggested that communities are increasingly vulnerable to climate change. Models of Ontario weather predict an increase of30% to 50% in extreme rain events by the end of the twenty-first century, which will result in more frequent flooding conditions (EMA Canada Inc., 2008). This century has already redefined the regional storm pattern, as Toronto has seen seven storms in 20 years that have 25-year return periods. The damage these changing events are causing is severe-the 2005 Toronto

61

storm that tore out a portion of Finch Street caused about $500 million in damage and is the most expensive storm in Ontario's history (EMA Canada Inc., 2008). The climate change adaptive and mitigative policy area focuses on protecting communities from the effects of severe w'eather events caused by climate change, as per Environment's Canada findings. Although the focus is on communities, this does not mean that ecosystems are not impacted, and "There is strong evidence that nonhuman nature is quite vulnerable to climate change ... [as] the maximum migration rates of many plant and animal species may not be fast enough to keep pace with climate changes .... [and] .... [m]any types of forest require centuries to adapt to changes in temperature and precipitation that greenhouse forces could impose in as little as three or four decades" (Hempel, 1996, 12). In order for municipalities to move towards sustainability, they need to become more resilient to the effects of climate change (Robinson and Legge, 1990). It is in regional governments' power to make communities respond to climate change by designing infrastructure that is more resilient to the effects of climate change, as well as reducing GHG emissions \vlthin communities (Dale, 2001; George, 2001; Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2010). The region of York currently designs water and wastewater infrastructure that will consider potential climate change effects (7.3.30), while Peel is developing tools to assess air quality implications for human health (2.2.3.3.1). Both regions have policies and plans to . manage the effects of climate change as well as to mitigate and adapt to climate change (Peel 7.6.2.3; York 3.2.2). Both regions have policies in place to identify lands subject to flooding hazards, but only York has identified flood management as pru1 of the preparations to manage climate change effects (Peel 2.4.4.2.1; York 2.3.20, 2.3.21). The regional policies around climate change exhibit characteristics of harmonization, as community needs, economic prosperity and environmental protection that mainly focuses

62

on the impact of humans are all considered. The policies related to making communities more resilient to climate change through climate change studies or community designs are viewed as making communities a priority. The policies related to minimizing the impacts of climate change such as promoting sustainable agriculture practices (York 6.3.15) or reducing air pollution (Peel 7.6.2.7) are viewed as making the environment a priority. The fact that the regions have adaptive and mitigative policies \\'ill most likely reduce the financial burden a community experiences as a result of severe weather events.
!;

Civic Engagement

The policy area of civic engagement consists of policies that support individual

~Uld

collective actions designed to identify and address issues of public concern (Conroy, 2006; Portney, 2002). Community participation and involvement are important factors in developing the political trust and cooperation needed for effective democratic governance (Hempel, 1996), which supports sustainable development because "democracy is fundamental to sustainability" (Roseland, 2005, 193). Ontario's Planning Act requires that municipalities provide a review of the planning process that is fair, open and accessible, with opportunities for the public to be consulted and to review all supporting information and material (Government of Ontario, 1990a). The Places to Grow Act also states that the public needs to be given an opportunity to participate during the review of each gro\vth plan. In order to conform to the Places to Grow Act, the Regional Official Plan review process conducted approximately 15 meetings and generated about 35 reports in Peel, and about 30

\

meetings and 80 reports in York (Region of Peel, 201Od; Region of York, 201Oc). To support the civic engagement policy area, the region of York encourages volunteerism (3. L 19) and ensures that sufficient information is available in a timely manner to the public and other levels of governments and the planning process is transparent (8. L 1,

63

8.1.2). Similarly, Peel provides opportunities for public consultation (7.3.5.2.1) and focuses on forming partnerships to, for example, encourage and facilitate the involvement of service providers, community organizations and stakeholders to address issues related to housing barriers (5.8.7.2.3), and with public and private stakeholders to develop a vision, determine priorities and implement action plans for a sustainable goods movement system in Peel (5.9.7.2.2). Even though public consultation as laid out in the provincial legislation does not have the level of public involvement and participation that is recommended for sustainable development (Pierce and Dale, 1999; Robison and Legge, 1990; Roseland, 2005), the Places
10 Grow Act received extensive support from planners, environmentalists and the general

public (Wekerle et aI., 2007). Ontario and its municipalities' public consultation process has the bare essentials to achieve sustainability, and these essentials include respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as respect for cultural diversity (United Nations Economic and Social Development, 2002).

Summary The presence of sustainable activities.
This analysis found that most of the policy areas in the sustain ability framework exist in the regions of Peel and York. Table 3: Presence of Sustainable Activities summarizes the presence of each policy area by region. The sustainable policy areas that do not exist in Regional Official Plans include the eco-industrial park area in York, and the affordable transit area in PeeL In addition, both regions are developing the urban forestry policy area Lastly, Peel and its municipalities are in the process of either developing or updating their pedestrian and bicycle access plans.

64

Previous sustainabiJjty studies experienced similar results. with low level of activities around eco-industrial parks, urban forestry and affordable transit. However, pedestrian and bicycle access plans were policy areas that were frequently cited in most urban areas (Conroy, 2006; Jepson, 2004; Portney,
2002~

Saba and Paterson, 2008).

The presence of policy integration.
Assessing the integration of regional policies can identify contradictions between policies, \"hich can impact communities from becoming more sustainable (Lafferty and Hovden, 2003). The objectives of the three sustainability pillars often contradict one another (JCLE!, ID RC and UNEP, 1996). For instance, the extemalization of costs for private profit can contradict the environmental objective to value and conserve natural resources. The global expansion of markets and the integration of national economies and free-trade agreements can undermine community objectives of local self-reliance (ICLEI, IDRC and UNEP, 1996). As mentioned earlier, one of the key defining features of sustainability is the emphasis on the integration of environmental objectives into non-environmental policy-sectors (Lafferty and Hovden, 2003) and the fact that sustainability cannot be achieved without all three elements progressing together simultaneously (Hempel, 1996; WCED, 1987).
An integration framework like the EPI offers a tool to recognize signs of integration,

providing insight into which elements of sustainability are integrated and to what degree (Runhaar et aI., 2009). The EPI was modified from its original focus on emironmental integration for this research, expanding to consider environmental as well as social and economic objectives. Table 4 shows the results of the integration analysis.

Harmonization was the most common type of integration assigned to the policy areas, occurring approximately 60% of the time in York and 50% in Peel. Peel has more policy areas than York that integrate the economic with the environmental elements. The region of York has more policy areas than Peel that integrate the three elements of sustainability. Peel

67

does not integrate its affordable housing policies with other elements of sustainability while York integrates its policy areas with at least one element of sustainability. In each region, prioritization and coordination each occurred about 20% to 25% of the time. The policy areas that prioritized the protection of natural resources v.ere usually accompanied by a set of studies to determine whether or not the protected area was impacted by development. A review of the content of the numerous studies identified in the Regional Official Plans is not part of the scope of this research, and the details of these studies are not always included in the policy descriptions. Similar to the requirements of the municipal comprehensive reviews, in the urban gro\Vth boundary policy area the details of environmental studies can provide insight \vhether they are supporting coordination or prioritization, with the former limiting and the latter improving the movement towards achieving sustainability. Finding that harmonization is present in most policy areas in York and Peel suggests that there are signs that the sustainability elements are moving simultaneously towards sustainability. This increases the chances of achieving sustainability, as the aim of harmonization is "to promote synergy and enhance the effectiveness of ... policy sectors" (Runhaar et aI., 2008, 422). The fact that both regions primarily integrate through a form of harmonization, the economic and environmental elements of sustainability suggests that the regions are moving towards more sustainable economic and environmental practices.

Regional compal'ison.

The comparative analysis examines two regions' policies subject to the same provinciaIland-use framework, the same planning review approach through a lens of sustainability, and with both having characteristics that according to Portney (2002) relate to how seriously a community is involved in sustainability efforts. The objective of the

68

comparative analysis is to learn about the strengths and \veaknesses that such municipalities brings towards achieving sustainability. Portney (2002) found that communities with a lower percentage of manufacturing services or with older population are the communities that take sustainability the most seriously. Both regions have a low manufacturing presence as well as a low percentage of younger population, see Table 2: Regional Profile. The following list is a summary of observations from the comparative analysis of York and Peel that summarizes factors that are believed to impact their move to\vards sustainability: · York has a low presence of integrated bike lanes, while Peel has no presence of integrated bike lanes in the smart development policy area. Cycling is one form of active transportation that can contribute to reducing Canada's GHG emissions, and it needs to have more presence in the communities for the public to make the shift from being car-dependent to an active form of transportation. · Peel encourages its local municipalities to incorporate smart development and energy conservation policy areas in Local Official PI ans, ,,,hile York requires its municipalities to comply. As per Berke and Manta Conroy's (2000) methodology, policies that are suggested decrease the chances of moving towards sustainability. · Peers water conservation measure of consumption per capita might provide unreliable data to assess whether the community's policies follow the most sustainable path. · York links its flood management to climate change strategies. The integration of environmental elements of sustainability into other sectors in community planning helps make policies mutually supportive in achieving the policy's objectives (Lafferty and Houden, 2003).

69

The regional policy comparative analysis provides insight into \vhether the Regions are moving towards achieving sustainability from a different angle than the previous two levels of analysis. The first level revealed the sustainability-focused policy areas that are present in the regions and the second level focused on the types of integration that take place between the pillars ofsustainabiJity, while the comparative analysis focused on the differences in policy content that can impact becoming more sustainable. The different approaches a community takes towards achieving the same goal can provide insight into the prospects of that approach to achieving the goal. The directives found in York and Peel's policies can further support or hinder the movement towards sustainability. For instance, a region's choice of applying voluntary policy tools can reduce the prospects of moving towards sustainability, as per Berke and Manta Conroy's (2000) methodology, and as can be seen in Peers energy conservation and smart development policies.

Research Limitations
The study ,vas mainly limited by a number of scope decisions, which were made in order to examine a topic as complex in nature as sustainability in the planning process. The research was limited as its methodology was guided by the objectives of a single piece of provincial legislation, the Places to Grow Act. Even though the goal of the Places to Grow Act is to manage growth in a sustainable manner, the multi and self-organizing environmental, economic and social systems of sustainable development cannot be captured in a single piece oflegislation. In addition, the study was limited by focusing on the Regional Official Plans, which restricted the scope to mostly land-use planning policies. These scope restrictions were apparent when the Regional Official Plans or the Places to Grow Act did not include any policies supporting certain policy areas in the sustainability framework, including

70

/

green procurement and eco-industrial parks, which the Regions are acti vely pursuing. In
I

addition. the study's focus on regional government prevented a complete view of local governments' movement towards achieving sustainability. as governmental responsibilities in Ontario are distributed among provincial, regional and municipal governments. This research focused solely on policy content and did not obtain the regions' views, experiences and policy directions. and these are not considered in the research's fmdings and conclusion. Lastly, the study assumes that each policy area is equally important in contributing to a community becoming more sustainable. Some previous studies weighted policy areas (Parkinson and Roseland, 2002) but most did not discuss the importance of each policy area in creating greater sustainability (Berke and Manta Conroy, 2000; Conroy. 2006; Jepson, 2004; Portney. 2002; Saba and Paterso~ 2008). The literature fe·view found no consistent way of weighting the overall contributions of sustainable measures in achieving greatersustainability (AboJina and ZHans, 2002; Berke and Manta Conroy, 2000; Conroy, 2006:
Jepso~

2004; Parkinson and Roseland, 2002; Portney, 2002; Saba and Paterson, 2008;

Tsenkova and Damiani, 2009) thus no weighted index was applied to this study's policy areas.

Findings
What contributions do the regions of York and Peel make in moving towards sustainability? Their Regional Official Plans support 95% of sustainability-focused policy areas, which were identified in previous studies as contributing to achieving su5'teinabifity (Berke and Manta Conroy. 2000; Conroy. 2006; Jepso~ 2004; Parkinson and Roseland·. 2002; Portney, 2002; Saba and Paterson, 2008). Most of the regions~
sustainability~focused

policies exhibit harmonization, the majority of\:~{hkh integrate economic and enyironmentnl
elements of sustainability. The integration of the economy and the environment aligns with

71

the goals of the Pla~es to Grow Act, which are to manage growth in a sustainable manner and create a cleaner environment in order to secure the future prosperiiy of the GGH (Ministry of Public Infrastructure Renewal. 2006). However. the primary focus is still econdmic performance, and understandably so-as discussed earlier. urbanization and economic performance are closely linked (Chakrabarty, 2001 cited in World Bank. 1991 and Cheema, 1993). Based on the rmding that the regions' policies have signs of integrating environmental and economic elements, and the high presence of sustainability-focused policy areas, the regions appear to be in the position of moving towards economic and . environmental sustainability. However, public support and the federal and provincial governments' fmancial assistance are the determining factors as to whether the regions will become more sustainable. In addition, there are a number of directives discussed in the comparative analysis that can hinder the move towards sustainability, including voluntary policies. a lack of active transportation, targets that are linked to minimal changes in community designs (such as lower intensification rates) and indicators that may mislead a communi ty as to its progress. It was found that Peel has a higher presence than York of factors that can weaken the path towards achieving sustainability. Public support and the financial assistance from higher levels of government were recognized as factors that can help. delay or hold back the community in moving to~ards . sustainability (Jepson, 2004). At the moment, the public is supportive and the governments' plans indicate that substantial financial assistance is going to be required to implement the

Places to Grow Act and other sustainabilitY-focused legislation. The Ontario budget's trend
of allocating more funding to urban roads instead of active transportation weakens the move towards achieving sustainability. and this trend was continued in both the 2008 and 2010 Ontario budgets (Ross, 2008; Anonymous, 2010, April 30).

Planning for only environmental and economic sustainability is a common occurrence in urban communities but it leaves economic and environmental issues isolated from social development (Saha and Paterson, 2008; Tsenkova and Damiani, 2009) and prevents the realization of sustainable development. Failing to integrate social development into sustainability can impede progress towards achieving economic and environmental sustainability, as the process of integration can remove contradictions between the policies and make them mutually supportive, a benefit that is not realized when full integration has not taken place (Lafferty and Houden, 2003). Approximately 30% of the harmonized policy' areas consider economic, social and environmental objectives simultaneously, while the remaining 70% concentrate on integrating environmental and economic elements only. Does this mean that York and Peel's low-income population will remain isolated from the economic and environmental benefits the regions have to offer, and that Canada will continue to have more frequent incidences oflow income than the OECD average? The region of Peel has no policy data in its Regional Official Plans on affordable transit and no signs of related regional initiatives. In addition, with no integration of affordable housing policies with other elements of sustainability. the prospects of improving their social situation in a sustainable manner are low. The region of York can potentially integrate its affordable transit policy with environmental objectives, as York's single policy on affordable transit vaguely refers to providing an. equitable transit strategy~ though York does integrate its affordable housing with economic objectives. York more strongly integrates its social policy than Peel does, increasing York's prospects of improving the lives of its low income population. What does this mean to the immigrant population that makes up almost half of Peel an.d York's population? (Statistics Canada. 2006). According to Statistics Canada (2006). '. , Ontario continues to be the province of choice for more than half of the newcomers who'
\

arrive in Canada. with most immigrants settling in the Greater Toronto Area. Regions that

73

,

have a stronger and more sustainable social foundation will not only provide social security and opportunities to become financially secure but will also improve the path towards achieving sustainability.

Chapter 4: Conclusion
The goal of this study was to provide insight whether the Regions of York and Peel are moving towards achieving sustainability. This study demonstrates that the regions have laid a foundation in achieving environmental and economic elements of sustainability. but have not reached full sustainability. In conforming to the Places to Grow Act, Regional Official Plans have the ability to address unsustainable practices like the over-use of natural resources for housing and transport purposes that are found in a developed country (Boyd and Suzuki. 2008). The movement towards achieving environmental and economic objectives can be diminished or improved by the federal and provincial governments' financial and policy support, by the specific content and direction of regional policy, such as whether a policy measure is able to provide reliable data or by integrating economic and environmental objectives 'with social needs. This research's findings agree with previous studies with respect to not connecting social equity andjustice issues to sustainability (Saha and Paterson, 2008). This is not to say that governments in Ontario have taken an entirely piecemeal approach as was found in other sustainability studies (Saha and Paterson, 2008; Tsenkova and Damiani. 2009), as this study fmds that environmental and economic integt:ation have a substantial presence in York and Peel's Regional Official Plans (Berke and Manta Conroy, 2000; Conroy, 2006; Jepson. 2004; Parkinson and Roseland. 2002; Portner. 2002; Saha and
t'

Paterson, 2008). Since the Ontario governments have not laid a foundation towards achieving sustainability, the results from the comparison and integration analyses offer insight that can be used to

realistic but ambitious targets and the extent to which policies' details are mutually

75

supportive in achie,,:ing the overall goal. The policies', weaknesses identified from the comparative analysis can be examined to determine whether these- policies warrant changes in order to improve the path towards achieving sustainability. Many of the envii~nmentalists' concerns about the lack of rapid responses to deal with global environmental problems are valid as seen in this study's results: legislation and plans based on sustainable development principles have established a foundation to move the communities towards more sustainable economic and environmental practices but not sustainability (Hempel, 1996). In addition, some of the policy directives suggest that the targets defmed to prevent further environmental degradation might be misleading or they are not as ambitious to protect the environment as other urban areas in a developed country. The key lessons from this study regard the research's methodology compared to the results obtained. It is well-known that the Places to Grow Act and its growth plan have the potential to address the GGH environmental degradation. The act is known as having a scope that is "breathtaking" (Ross, 2008, 25) and is recognized through a number of awards, such as the Daniel Burnham Award from the American Planning Association (Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, 20lOc). The intent of this study was to perform a detailed analysis in order to move beyond simply looking for the signs of sustainability in the form of the presence or absence of policy areas and actions that have or have not been taken, and provide insight into whether the Regions are moving towards sustainable development This study coul4 have. provided more insight into the movement towards sustainability by establishing clear and detailed sustainability objectives for each sustainable element \\lthin each policy area. During the analysis it became evident that the objectives for each suStainability element were not defmed to the level of detail required, which did not support the detailed nature of the analysis and limited the integration analysis.

76

Do regions currently have tools in place to perfonn a sustainability check before policies are implemented? Does the province carry out any sustainability checks before it approves Regional Official Plans? This research's recommendation is that a sustainability policy check is valuable to any community working towards sustainable development. It will identify any policy issues during the policy design phase rather than uncovering them over a period of time. The method presented in this paper is a starting point that needs to be refined and built upon. The method used in this research is open to many changes, including making the sustainability framework more equitable by having an equal number of policy areas supporting each element, modifying the policy integration fonns to consider other policy sectors, and applying the tool to one policy area (for instance, the area of active transportation in the GGH, as this issue touches on all imperati yes of sustainability and crosses multiple communities). The recommeridation is meant not only to perfonn a sustainability check at the time the policy planning exercise is completed but every time a new initiative, program or legislation is planned. The scope of this study was to analyze only two regions because of the exploratory and detailed nature of the analysis, but it makes sense to apply the sustainability check to all regions within the GGH, as the Places 10 Grow Act's growth pl~ was created for the GGH. This research expects the findings from the six regions to be much different than the findings from York and Peel because of the variety of community profiles and , cultures. Some regions might not have as many of the characteristics that Portney (2002) found that make communities treat sustainability more seriously. From the news releases of regions' progress in conforming to the Places to Grow Act, some regions like Durham might have a weaker presence of smart development provisions, as it wants to continue to offer its communities single detached housing. One region's "sprawl-friendly;' lifestyle will probably have an effect·

77

on the smart growth in other regions in terms of population growth, and housing and land costs (Anonymous, 2010, June 7). Future research can review the methodology explored in this study to determine if existing policy planning tools already address similar sustainability checks, and to what extent. Moving forward, research needs to question the benefits of such sustainability tools in comparison to the effort invested in using them If the value of these tools warrants the effort. the methodology presented in this paper needs to be refined and built upon by carrying out the suggestions made throughout this chapter. Another potential research topic can be to determine the government level most suited to using this type of tool in order to best understand whether the legislation, plans and communities support the move towards sustainability. An examination at a provincial level will provide insight into the contradictions, weaknesses and strengths that the provincial (that is, provincial and municipal) activities contribute towards sustainable development, while an examination at a federal level vvill provide insight into the federal, provincial and municipal contributions towards sustainability. Sustainability requires personal and institutional changes that strengthen capacities for both cooperation and ecological awareness (Hempel, 1996). It requires a new way of planning and governing communities with goals that place equal value on environmental, social and economic imperatives (Dale, 2001). It challenges policy makers to find the rightcombination of new policy directions, governmental cooperation, public support and financial priorities to support the complexities and the changing dynamics of communities' sustainability needs (Robinson, 2008).

Peel Regional Official Plan Policies

The Region which consists of urban and rural areas, both of which are identified in ROP (5.4.2.1), have established boundaries for built up areas, designated greenfield areas (5.5.3.2.1), employment lands within Urban and Rural areas (5.6.2.1), core areas of the Greenland System. Within the Urban areas, lines were established around Urban Growth Centres, Intensification Corridors, Urban Nodes, Major Transit Station Areas (5.5.3.2.5, 5.5.3.2.6) and Urban System (5.3.2.1), Within Urban Areas lines were established around natural and resources land (5.3.2.1). Urban Growth Boundary policies establishing lines around a community/region and the application of zoning . regulations that restrict urban development to the areas inside the line. In the Rural Areas, three Rural Service Centres were identified (5.4.3.2.1. 5.3.2.1), they are Mayfield West, Bolton and Caledon East (5.4.3.2.6.5.4.3.2.7,5.4.3.2.2) and settlement area which was identified as the Caledon East Rural Service Centre (2.2.9.3.7, 5.4.5.2.1). In addition. policy 5.4.5.2.1 defmed the boundaries around the Palgrave Estate Residential Community. Lastly, study areas were identified and study of employment lands within the three rural service centres/settlements (5.6.2.4). ' The Region requires that between 2015 and 2025 40 percent of the Region's residential development, annually, will occur within the built up area, and after 2025,50 percent of the Region's residential development occur within the built up area, annually (5.5.3.2.4, 5.5.3.2.5). The Region will direct a significant portion of new growth to the built up areas through intensification (5.5.2.2). Intensification is .required in Urban Growth Centres, Intensification Corridors, Nodes, Major Transit Stations and other appropriate areas within the built up area (5.5.3.2.3). Lastly, it is prohibited to establish new settlements 'areas (5.5.2.4) and the Region is protecting employment lands around airports and major highways (5.6.2.10) by prohibiting the development, redevelopment and infill of new residential and sensitive land

82

uses around airports (5.9.6.2.4) and making the requests 10 conve:rt lands from employment to nonemployment go through a municipal comprehensive review (5.6.2.6). The Rural areas direct the growth to the three Rural Service Centres, the Palgrave Estate Residential Community, other rural settlements (lands already committed for residential development) as designated in local official plans and the Niagara Escarpment, Greenbelt and Growth Plans (5.4.5.2.2, 5.4.5.2.3, 5.4.2.2, 5.4.4.2.3). The Rural areas also require to prepare a secondary plan prior to releasing lands for estate. residential development outlining the detailed land uses (5.4.3.2.3) and only allowed development if infrastructure is there to support it as well as it is compatible with the community and environment is protected (5.4.3.2,3). The Region will prepare a growth management and phasing strategies which will address and incorporate issues such as the improvement of live-work relationships, appropriate levels of industrial-commercial to total assessment ratio, priority growth areas, Growth Plan policies and targets, sustainable rate of employment growth related to population growth (5.2,2.1). The Region will direct development and redevelopment to the Urban System (5.3.2.2) according to the growth management phasing strategies (5.3.2.4). Cities of Brampton and Mississauga are required to provide opportunities for compact forms of urban development and redevelopment with commercial, residential, recreational, cultural and civic activities that offer a wide range of goods and services to the residents and workers of Peel Region and other residents of the Greater Toronto Area and Hamilton (5,3.3.2.1). Lastly, Northwest Brampton development is to ensure an orderly progression of development in relation to the ongoing development of lands within the existing urban boundary. In addition, this area is to provide for the protection and potential use of the shale resource, while recognizing the long-term use of these lands will be for urban purposes (5.3.4.1.8) and meet the requirements of the Growth Plan (5,3.4.1.7). Most of the policies focusing on extensions or expansions of established lines or boundaries require that the ROP to be amended if boundaries will be modified (5.4.4.2.2,5.3.3.2.2). This impacts urban growth centres, rural service centres, the Palgrave Estate Residential Community, urban or rural settlements and boundaries. ,The other common requirement that requests for boundary expansions need to meet is that they will support ROP's intensification and density targets (5.4.4.2,2, 5.5.3,2.8, 5.5.4.2.4). Last requirement is to complete a comprehensive analysis (5.2.2.3) ,especially for regional urban boundary. Minor adjustments do not require 'amendments to the plan (5.2.2.2. and 7.2.2.7).

83

Overall, this analysis has identified 62 policies related to establishing lines around a community/region and the application of zoning regulations that restrict urban development to the areas inside the line. Most of the policies, 31 were focused on development, 25 policies focused on designating boundaries and 12 policies dealt with boundary expansions.
Additional Policies: 2.2.10.4.20 Permit at the lO-year Greenbelt Plan review period, modest settlement area expansions for

TownsNillages, provided the proposed growth: r · b) Would not exceed the assimilative and water production capacities of the local environment as determined on a watershed or subwatershed basis; · c) Complies with any applicable watershed plan; · d) Does not extend into the Natural Heritage System; 2.2.10.4.22 Where the Town of Caledon had initiated the consideration of a settlement expansion within the Protected Countryside prior to December 16, 2004, such an expansion may be considered through the Town's exercise to bring its official plan into conformity with the Greenbelt Plan. 2.2.10.S.12 Require, where settlement area expansions are contemplated, the completion or approval of the environmental assessment in support of expanded sewage and water services prior to amending the boundaries of the settlement within the municipal official plan. The expansion must not exten"d into the Natural Heritage System. Smart Development - zoning provisions that permit integrated development projects characterized by mixed uses, high densities, centralized common areas, distributed and accessible open space, health care and recreational facilities, and an integrated system of walkways, bikeways and transit.
Summary of Findings

Four smart development policies were coded for this research. The four policies provided provisions for mix use, high densities, accessible open space, health care and recreational facilities, and an integrated system of walkways and transit. None of these policies mentioned providing an integrated bicycle system. In two of the policies, which provided provisions for mix use, high density and an integrated system of walkways and transit, the Region required the local municipalities to include these provisions in the local official plans (5.3.3.2.3, 5.3.3.2.4). The other two policies, the Region is encouraging the local municipalities consider in their policies provisions for mix use, an integrated system of walkways and transit, high quality public open space and easy access to retail and services, where the analysis interpret the services as health care and recreations facilities (5.3.2.6 and 5.S.2.1). The required policies focused on Urban Growth Centres while the volunt~olicies focused on Urban System and Communities.

5.6.2.12 Encourage the planning and development of employment land in a manner consistent with sustainable development imperatives as outlined in the Themes of the Plan in section 1.3.5 of this Plan. Energy efficient buildings that meet Regional green development standards will be encouraged.
The over-arching theme of this Plan (section 1.3.5 of ROP) is sustainability which refers to meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Regional Council will work towards sustainability by applying a sustainable development framework which wiH provide a holistic approach to planning, action and measurement. Peel's environment imperative seeks to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and other pollutants while promoting best practices in sustainable development including use of green development standards, energy and water efficient systems and living within the carrying capacity of Peel's supporting ecosystems. The economic imperative is to promote a strong, vibrant and prosperous economy that operates within the sustainability theme while encouraging environmentally friendly businesses and business practices. This voluntary policy aligns to the Peel's sustainable development framework described in theme ofROP. Policy 5.6.2.12 has signs and potential to be a policy which manages ece-industrial parks. Eco-industrial characteristics include the planning and development of environmentally friendly business, business practices and employment lands in sustainable manner but it directly does not support the management of eco-industrial parks. Purchase of development rights. policy allowing the municipality to purchase development rights from landowner for areas that have received special conservation designation. Policies establishing minimum density targets requirements for industrial, commercial and residential zones 2.6.2.1 Support Greenlands securement initiatives in Peel through planning policy, stewardship, monitoring and land acquisition; 2.6.2.5 Support the securement of natural areas through planning policy, stewardship and monitoring before land acquisition is considered.

Policies to manage development by defining eco-industrial parks

:The Region promotes and facilitates intensification (5.5.3.2.2) and with the collaboration with the area municipalities and other stakeholders such as the conservation authorities, the building and development industry, and landowners encourages new residential development, redevelopment and intensification in support of Regional and area municipal official plan policies promoting c;::ompac1 forms of development and

85

residential intensification (5.8.2.6). In addition, Peel encourages the area municipalities to establish policies which support residential redevelopment in appropriate areas that have sufficient existing or planned infrastructure. and, cost-effective and compact forms of development standards for new residential and other types of development. redevelopment, and intensification (5.8.2.2. 5.3.2.3). 5.3.3.2.4 Require the area municipalities to prepare, in a reasonable time frame if they have not already. effectively done so, policies for the Urban Growth Centres that are identified in this Plan and consistent with the Growth Plan. addressing the following: e) the achievement of a minimUm gross density target of 200 residents and jobs combined per hectare by 2031 or earlier;, ' The Region plans to achieve a minimum greenfield densitY target of 50 people and jobs combined per . hectare by 2031, to be measured over Peel's designated greenfield area excluding major environmental features as defined by the Growth Plan or comparable Regional methodology (S.S.4.2.1) and has provided an additional density target option for the local municipalities of a minimum of 60 residents per hectare and a minimum of 35 jobs per hectare to be achieved by 2031 (5.5.4.2.2). In addition. the Region encourages the local municipalities to require development arolUld major transit stations within the designated greenfield area to achieve a minimum density of 100 residents andjobs combined per hectare (5.5.4.2.6) and a density of 50 jobs per hectare in employment land to contribute to achieving the greenfield density target (5.6.2.13). The Region with the local municipalities will identify the areas within the designated greenfield area where development will need to be phased to achieve a minimum greenfield density of 50 residents and jobs combined per hectare (5.5.4.2.3). The Gro\\>th Plan and the Region have identified intensification targets for residential development Peel requires that by 2015 and for each year unti1202S~ a minimum of 40 per cent of the Region's residential development occurring annually to be located within the built-up area (S.S.3.2.4) and that by 2026 and for each year thereafter. a minimum of 50 per cent of the Region's residential development occurring annually \viU be within the built-up area (5.5.3.2.5). i . The Region also requires the local municipalities to develop intensification strategies that, among other things, identify urban growth centres, intensification corridors, urban nodes, major transit station areas and other intensification areas to support achievement of the intensification objectives (5.S.3.2.6) and to ' consider expansion of the 2031 Urban Boundary or settlement boundary only if such expansion supports achieving the minimum intensification targets established by policies 5.5.3.2.4 and 5.S.3.2.5 and is
j

86

consistent with the ROP's Performance Measurement Program (5.5.3.2.8), which is a mechanism for measuring and evaluating the effectiveness of the policies and related metrics (Section 7.9 of ROP). Lastly, The Region encourages the local municipalities to add a density bonusing provision in their respective official plans and develop detailed implementation guidelines and protocols (5.8.3.2.4). Density bonusing is a local municipality by-law which authorizes the increases in the height and density of development in return for the provision of such facilities, services or matters as are set out in the by-law. Examples of provisions may include affordable housing, underground parking, parkland, daycare facilities, and more (ROP Glossary).

Add These Policies: 2.2.10.4.21 Permit infill and intensification within the approved boundaries of Hamlets in the Protected Countryside, subj ect to appropriate water and sewage services. (part of Greenbelt section in ROP) 2.2.10.5.14 Permit only in the following circumstances new or expanded partial servicing, if site conditions are suitable for the long-term provision of such services: · Where such servicing is necessary to address failed individual on-site sewage or water services serving existing development; or · To allow for infilling and intensification within settlement areas served by partial services as of the date the Greenbelt Plan came into effect."

Environmental Sustainability Identify: Summary of Findings: The Region recognizes the Oak Ridges Moraine as a provincially significant feature (2.2.9.3.1), and considers the following as environmentally and biologically sensitive and significant spaces: key natural heritage features, key hydrologic features, natural heritage system, the Greenland System and woodlands.
The Region defines key natural heritage features as outlined in the ORMCP, they are (2.2.9.3.9): · Wetlands', · Significant portions of the habitat of endangered, rare and threatened species;c) Fish habitat; · Areas of natural and scientific interest (life science); · Significant valley lands; · Significant woodlands; · Significant wildlife habitat; and
\

Policy establishing a systematic identification and strategic protection of environmentally sensitive and biologically significant open spaces in the region and corridors to connect them by prohibiting development in these spaces

· Sand barrens, savannahs and tall grass prairies. Peel defines the key natural heritage features within the Natural Heritage System of the Greenbelt Plan the same as in the ORMCP but it adds fish habitat and alvars (2.2.10.4.12). Key natural heritage features outside of the Natural Heritage System within the Protected Countryside of the Greenbelt Plan shall be defined in accordance with the Greenlands System policies of this Plan (2.2.10.4.13). The Natural Heritage System includes areas of the Protected Countryside with the highest concentration of the most sensitive and/or significant natural features and functions. These areas need to be managed as a connected and integrated natural heritage system given the functional inter-relationships between them, and the fact this system builds upon the natural systems contained in the NEP and the ORMCP. Together with the landscape surrounding the Greenbelt, these systems currently comprise, and function as, a connected natural heritage system. The Natural Heritage System is not a designation in and of itself with a list of \ permitted uses. Rather, it functions as an overlay on top of the prime agricultural and/or rural area designations contained in municipal official plans (Greenbelt Plan, 2005). The Region identifies the Natural Heritage System as an overlay designation of the Protected Countryside and directs the Town ofCaledon and City of Brampton to identify in the local official plan schedules the Natural Heritage System as an overlay designation of the Protected Countryside (2.2.10.4.7). The Region defines hydrologically sensitive features as outlined in the ORMCP, they are (2.2.9.3.10): · Permanent and intermittent streams; · Wetlands; · Kettle lakes; and · Seepage areas and springs. Pell defines key hydrologic features within the Protected Countryside of the Greenbelt Plan the same as features outlined in the ORMCP except kettle lakes are replaced by lakes (and their littoral zones) (2.2.10.4.14).

It directs the Town of Caledon to identify the location of known key natural heritage features and kno\\TI hydrologically sensitive features in its Official Plan and Zoning By-law where such identification is technically feasibl e (2.2.9.3.11).

88

The Region does need to identify key natural heritage features and key hydrologic features in accordance with criteria established by the Province where such identification is technically feasible (2.2.1004.15). The Greenlands System in Peel is being made up of Core Areas, Natural Areas and Corridors and Potential' Natural Areas and Corridors (2.3,2.1). The Core Areas consist of (2.3.2.2): · Significant wetlands (Class 1-3) · Significant coastal wetlands · Core woodlands · Environmentally Sensitive or Significant Areas~ · Provincial Life Science Areas of Natural and Scientific Interest; · Significant habitats of threatened and endangered species · Escarpment Natural Areas of the Niagara Escarpment Plan; and · Core valley and stream corridors. Core valley and stream corridors include the main branches, major tributaries and other tributaries associated with the Credit River, the Etobicoke Creek, the Mimico Creek, the West Humber River and the Humber River and with the other identified watercourses draining directly to Lake Ontario; except for those portions in the Rural Service Centres and the rural settlements in the Rural System as designated in an area municipal official plan. These valley and stream corridors are continuous linkages connecting to other elements of the Greenlands System Core Areas. According to policy 2.3.204, the local municipalities may define local core areas and policies in their Official Plans which will, at a minimum, incorporate the Core Areas of the Greenlands System in Peel. The Natural Areas and Corridors consist of (2.3.2.8): · evaluated non-provincially significant wetlands · NAC woodlands meeting one or more of the criteria in Table 1 · significant wildlife habitat meeting one or more of the criteria in Figure 5 · regionally significant life science Areas of Natural and Scientific Interest · provincially significant earth science Areas of Natural and Scientific Interest · Escarpment Protection Areas of the Niagara Escarpment Plan · the Lake Ontario shoreline and littoral zone and other natural lakes and their shorelines

any other valley and stream corridors that as part of the Core Areas; headwater source and discharge areas; and any other natural features and functional areas interpreted as part of the Greenlands System Natural Areas and Corridors by the individual area municipalities, in consultation with the conservation authorities and the Ministry of Natural Resources, including, as appropriate, elements of the Potential Natural Areas and Corridors.

The Potential Natural Areas and Corridors consists of (2.3.2.9) subject to the provisions of policy 2.3.2.8 (i) as: · unevaluated wetlands; · cultural woodlands and cultural savannahs \\lthin the Urban System and Rural Service Centres meeting one or more of the criteria in Table 1. The evaluation of cultural woodlands and cultural savannahs is also subj eet to policy 2.3.2.18. · any other woodlands greater than 05 hectares (I .24 acres)~ · regionally significant earth science Areas of Natural and Scientific Interest~ · sensitive groundwater recharge areas; · portions of Historic shorelines; · open space portions of the Parkway Belt West Plan Area; · potential ESAls identified as such by the conservation authorities; and · any other natural features and functional areas interpreted as part of the Greenlands System Potential Natural Areas and Corridors, by the individual area municipalities in consultation with the conservation authorities. II

The Region directs the local municipalities to interpret woodlands to include plantations except where a more detailed environmental study has demonstrated that the plantation does not exhibit the characteristics necessary to satisfy the definition of woodlands in this Plan, in which case, the plantation shall not be considered to be a woodland for the purposes of this Plan (2.3.2.17) and to include or develop criteria and thresholds for woodlands identified as Natural Areas and Corridors and Potential Natural Areas and Corridors in accordance 'with the criteria in Table 1 and to consider criteria and thresholds based on environmental, h sio ra hic, social and economic factors (2.3.2.1 9).

90

The Region supports, in consultation with the local municipalities, the conservation authorities, the Niagara Escarpment Commission, where applicable, and the Ministry of Natural Resources to define the boundaries of the Greenlands System in Peel in terms of functions, landforms, attributes, linkages, critical elements, . and rehabilitation and natural habitat restoration opportunities, including the preparation of technical documents (2.3.2.11). In addition, Peel supports the joint efforts of the conservation authorities and area municipalities to continue to refine mapping with respect to Environmentally Sensitive or Significant Areas and ravine, valley and stream corridors, including headwater areas and setbacks from the water course and/or valley walls and the other components of the natural environment in Peel, as appropriate (7.6.2.12). Lastly, the Region supports studies and the creation of databases for the larger environmental systems (2.2.2.2) and to participate in, and support, broader scale environmental studies in order to assess the carrying capacity of ecosystems and the potential cumulative effects of development in areas where development is likely to have a major impact on the integrity of broader ecosystems and the Greenlands System in Peel (see Section 2.3) (2.2.2.3).

Protect General- Summary of Findings
The Region protects, maintains and enhances the quality and integrity of ecosystems, including air, water, land and biotajointly with the area municipalities, conservation authorities and provincial agencies (2.1.3.2), including Natural Areas and Corridors and Potential Natural Areas and Corridors (2.3.2.10).

The Region protect. maintain and enhance the quality and quantity of water resources, including surface and groundwater systems, jointly with the area municipalities, conservation authorities and other related agencies (3.4.2.1) by directing the local municipalities to require appropriate hydrological and hydrogeological studies be undertaken, to the satisfaction of the Region, the area municipalities and the conservation authorities, for all planning initiatives that may have an immediate or cumulative impact on water resources, when possible these studies should be integrated with subwatershed plans (3.4,2.6), by to establish coordinated procedures with respect to water taking permits (3.4.2.9), by supporting sound agricultural land management and soil conservation practices, and other measures that minimize or eliminate the amount of pesticides, nutrients, silt and other contaminants which have the potential to enter ground and surface water systems of the region (3.4.2.8), and by promoting strategies intended to reduce and prevent impacts on the environment through appropriate design of the transportation system and, specific to water pollution, the treatment of urban runoff(S.9.8.2.3). In addition, it directs the To\VTI ofCaledon to prohibit the approval of major development unless the relevant requirements outlined in Sections 24 (watershed plans), 30 (8) (land conservation plans show all water bodies), 43 (well head I protection areas, areas of high aquifier vulenrability), 45 (stormwater management), and 46 (stormwater management plans) of the ORMCP. have been satisfied (2.2.9.3.25) and the local municipalities to include in their official plans, objectives and policies for the management of stormwater quality and quantity that would avoid, minimize andlor mitigate storm water volume, contaminant loads and impacts to receiving water courses. (2.4.4.2.4). The Region has specific policies to protect and manage the aquifiers, Great Lake, groundwater, \\'atersheds, subwatersheds, valley and stream corridors. wetlands, sewage and water infrastructure, wells and wellheads . · these policies are located in excel document Energy and Water Conservation Policies: 5.8.5.2.1 Identify and promote, in collaboration with the area municipalities, energy and water efficient technologies in new residential development, redevelopment, and intensification to the development industry. 5.8.5.2.3 Encourage the area municipalities to offer incentives to developers and contractors through planning approvals to implement additional green standards beyond the minimum Ontario Building Code provisions that make homes more energy efficient.

108

Additional Policies: 2.2.10.5.12 Require, where settlement area expansions are contemplated, the completion or approval of the environmental assessment in support of expanded sewage and water services prior to amending the boundaries of the settlement within the municipal official plan. The expansion must not extend into the Natural Heritage System. 2.2.10.5.17 Direct the City of Brampton and the TOVvn of Caledon to require storm water management plans for applications for development and site alteration in the Protected Countryside. These storm water management plans shall meet the objectives of the Greenbelt Plan and demonstrates that a) Planning, design and construction practices will minimize vegetation removal, grading and soil compaction, sediment erosion and impervious surfaces; b) Where appropriate, an integrated treatment approach shall be used to minimize storm water management flows and structures through such measures as lot level controls and conveyance techniques such as grass swales; and c) Applicable recommendations, standards or targets within watershed plans and water budgets are complied with. 2.4.2.2.2 Support the City of Mississauga, in conjunction with the conservation authorities, in directing development and site alterations to areas outside the Lake Ontario Regulatory Shoreline.

5.9.8.2.5 Increase the number of hybrid and alternative fuel vehicles in the Regional fleet, thereby reducing both the amount of conventional fuel used and the emissions resulting from its use. (Adopted ROP A 22) 6.4.2.6 In partnership with the area municipalities, use procurement as a method to promote source reduction through the significant purchasing power of the Region and the area municipalities.
Green procurement - municipal contracts with environmentally responsible management practices.
Summary of Findings The Region is to develop (or has already done so) a program to retrofit its owned facilities and buildings and encourages the area municipalities to retrofit their own facilities and buildings (3.7.2.7). It also encourages the increased use of electric, hybrid and alternative fuel vehicles for Regional operations and the Regional fleet, where the production of such fuels, uses waste biomass and does not consume land that would otherwise be used for growing food, and does not conflict with existing and planned uses (5.9.8.2.5,3.7.2.9). In addition, The Region jointly with the local municipalities, the Province, hydro utilities and private power generating companies, are studying the potential of broadening the role of the Region to own and/or operate district energy systems (7.6.2.15).

Integrated Waste Management

Summary of Findings: The Region acti vely encourages, promotes and supports the efforts of government, the area municipalities the private sector and the general public which reduce waste, or emphasize reuse, recycling, composting and other minimization options including extended producer responsibility (6.4.2.2). Peel has prepared and maintains, in cooperation with the area municipalities, a Waste Management Strategy to achieve the waste management objectives by focusing on reduction, reuse, and recycling programs, and recovering resources of residual waste prior to landfill which may include, but is not limited to, the following measures: (6.4.2.1, 7.6.2.20) · reducing adverse impacts of waste to the natural environment; · integrating the principle and hierarchy of the 3Rs into the decision making of consumers, businesses and governments; · establishing and maintaining an environmentally responsible and cost-effective system for managing waste; · establishing targets for the diversion, reduction and potential elimination from landfill of waste within the region, and recommending programs and plans, including financial considerations, for achieving such targets; and · establishing public education and promotion programs on various concepts of waste management. II The Region mainly focuses on waste diversion and ways of reusing the waste that was generated although it also uses use procurement as a method to promote source reduction in the purchases that the Region and local municipalities make (6.4.2.6.

Waste diversion:
The Region requires new development to comply with the Peel Waste Collection Design Standards Manual to ensure safe and efficient waste collection and diversion through consultation with the area municipalities and applicants. (6.4.2.3), and through the Region's sewer use by-law, provide education and proper disposal of household hazardous waste which will also reduce the pressure on to the sanitary sewers and sewage treatment plants (6.3.2.8). Peel is also to explore and consider options to address industrial commercial and institutional waste

110

diversion such as mandatory recycling plans, pay-as-you-throw, and waste hauler reporting programs (6.4.2.17) and consider economic and policy tools for all multi-residential buildings to encourage waste diversion (6.4.2.18).

Waste Uses:
Most of the waste management policies identified in the analysis, almost 50%, focused on reusing the waste that was generated and looking for markets, and reusing of construction materials. Peel is to develop specifications where practical for all Regionally funded projects to incorporate materials from waste diversion programs where viable to help create stable, sustainable markets for materials from Regional diversion programs (6.4.2.7), and encourage local the local municipalities to require developers and contractors to incorporate materials from waste diversion programs into construction projects where practical (6.4.2.8), The Region encourages the local municipalities to issue site approvals and building permits as a means to require materials generated at construction and demolition sites to be diverted and reused (6.4.2.14) and to adopt procurement specifications for maximizing diversion and reuse of construction and demolition waste for all new construction and demolition projects which the area municipalities fund, and to consider economic and other incentives to encourage high reuse of construction and demolition waste (6.4.2.16). Lastly, Peel to develop procurement specifications where possible for all new construction and demolition projects, which the Region funds to maximize diversion and reuse requirements and encourage the reuse of construction materials through economic and other incentives (6.4.2.15),

The Region recognizes ener&ry from waste facilities and other technologies as options for recovering resources from residual waste generated within Peel Region prior to landfill (6.4.2.9). It aims to maximize to the extent reasonably practical, the recovery of resources from the waste stream such as extracting energy from the residual waste stream prior to final disposal (6.4.2.10) and encourages the local municipalities to develop guidelines to permit energy from waste facilities in appropriate locations (6.4.2.13). The Region to monitor and evaluate technology developments and consider options for recovering energy from waste on an on-going basis (6.4.2.11) and request the provincial government to recognize energy from

111

I .

-------------------------r--------------~--------~---------~--~--------------------------------------

waste as a method of waste diversion to ensure that the maximum resources are extracted from all municipal waste prior to final disposal (6.4.2.12).

Lastly, The Region requires the local municipalities to permit waste facilities, including processing and storage in appropriate locations so that the policies do not present unreasonable barriers to development of waste facilities (6.4.2.4). Peel to ensure that the location of any new waste disposal management facility is consistent with the objectives and policies in this Plan and the local municipal offici a) plans (6.4.2.5) and considers partnerships with neighbouring municipalities and private industry when exploring the development of new waste management infrastructure as it can lead to a contribution ofland, capital, or a commitment to tonnage which will improve the economics of a new facility (6.4.2.19). Note: some of these policies also belong in green procurement. The Region works with Metrolinx, other Provincial agencies and ministries, area municipalities, and other regions and municipalities in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area to implement the Metrolinx Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) and contribute to the ongoing development of the RTP (5.9.2.15), and to promote the use of innovative technologies (e.g. Intelligent Transportation Systems) to improve the efficiency, reliability and safety of the Regional transportation system. (5.9.2.22). Transportation demand management - policy encouraging the reduction of automobile use through the application of traffic control, public parking and public transit and road strategies. The Region works with the local municipalities, adjacent municipalities, other levels of government and non-governmental agencies to develop and implement Transportation DemfU1d Management programs to reduce trip distance and time and increase the modal share of alternatives to single-occupant automobiles (5.9.2.12,5.9.9.2.6). In addition, Peel works v>ith the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area municipalities, the Province and stakeholder groups to minimize traffic congestion, air pollution and noise pollution from automobiles and other modes of transportation (5.9.8.2.1). York also works with all levels of the public and private sector the Province, area municipalities and adjacent municipalities to provide transportation systems that are safe, sustainable and energy efficient, offer travellers a variety of mobility choices, and encourage the most financially and environmentally appropriate mode for trip-making. (5.9.2.2). York works to develop programs that place primary consideration on the reduction or elimination of trips and the increased use of sustainable modes of transportation and to develop programs for implementing these and other travel demand management strategies (5.9.9.2.3). And encourages efficient fuel use and conservation by promoting Transportation Demand Management programs, linked trips, the use of Intelligent Transportation Systems and the use of public transit and active transportation (5.9.8.2.4).

112

Lastly, Yark works with the Province and local municipalities to support the integration of transportation system planning, land use planning and transportation investment at a11 stages of the planning process. (5.9.2.3), and, coordinates, when appropriate, one or more joint planning studies in cooperation with the Region of York, City of Brampton, To\\'fl of Caledon and City of Vaughan, to establish mutual long term transportation and transit implementation strategies and servicing infrastructure requirements respecting designated and proposed development in the vicinity of Regional Road 50 in Brampton and Vaughan (7.6.2.19). The Region optimizes the use of existing and new Regional transportation infrastructure to support growth in an efficient, compact form, and encourages the area municipalities to do the same for infrastructure under their jurisdiction. (5.9.2.5), and when planning for development, York optimizes and/or expands new or existing Regional transportation corridors to support opportunities for multi-modal use, where feasible and to prioritize transit, carpooling, active transportation (5.9.2.7). The Region considers, as part of the development review approval process, the magnitude and timing of development proposals relative to the anticipated transportation demand of the proposed development, and anticipated cumulative transportation effects, on Regional facilities (5.9.2.8) and to identify with the cooperation the local municipalities and the Province, transportation improvements to the provincial, regional and area municipal systems required to support future development or redevelopment, and determine region-wide impacts through comprehensive transportation studies (5.9.2.10). The Region works with the local municipalities and the Province to develop enhanced tools and techniques for assessing the impacts of new development on sustainable modes of transportation and on transportation demand management measures (5.9.2.9) and to encourage local municipalities to (5.9.9.2.1): · Promote land uses and site design which foster the use of sustainable modes of transportation · Promote infrastructure to encourage teleworking; · Promote a balance of jobs and housing in communities to reduce the need for long distance commuting; and · For new development in designated greenfield areas, create street configurations, densities and an urban form that support walking, cycling and the early integration and sustained viability of transit services and create high quality public open spaces with site design and urban design standards that support opportunities for transit, walking and cycling. In addition, The Region to encourage school boards to select school site locations, define catchment areas

113

and design school campuses to maximize walking and bicycling as the primary means of travel to school (5.9.1 0.2.7). The Region also focuses on carpool lots, High Occupancy Vehicle, Lane Net\vork Lane, multi-purpose reserved lanes, parking management, widening, improving or building roads with transit in mind. improving existing transit and providing buses that can carry bicycles.

York promotes and pursues Federal and Provincial incentives for Regionally funded housing proj ects to help support the Region's sustainability goals (5.8.5.2.4) and advocates to the Province to explicitlyprovide municipalities the authority to use inclusionary zoning as a tool to require affordable housing (5.8.3.2.5). The Region encourages residential development, redevelopment and intensification to include an affordable housing component by promoting incentives or funding from different levels of government (5.8.3.2.11), encourages and supports local municipalities in creating and maintaining appropriate opportunities for the provision of affordable housing, including social and special needs housing (6.2.2.13), providing and maintenance of an adequate supply of affordable rental and ownership housing to meet the diverse needs of all Peel residents, in partnership with the area municipalities, non-profit and private providers, and through the effective use of all available and appropriate affordable housing programs and housing rehabilitation funding sources (6.2.2.17). York to develop a Peel Housing Strategy in collaboration with the local municipalities and appropriate stakeholders, which will include affordable, social and special needs housing components. This strategy should include a component on advocacy to promote housing issues and to address housing needs (6.2.2.14), an implementation plan with priorities and timeframes among various housing needs of residents, and, programs and actions to address these needs (5.8.2.7), a monitoring system to evaluate activities undertaken in support of the Regional Housing Strategy so that they can be revised on an ongoing basis as the housing needs of Peel residents change (5.8.2.8). Lastly, the Region to evaluate the need to update the Regional Housing Strategy in conjunction with future Regional Official Plan reviews (5.8.2.9).

Affordable Housing - zoning regulations that encourage or require the provision of lower cost housing.

118

The Region encourages and supports the local mlmicipalities to plan for a range of densities and forms of housing affordable to all households, including low and moderate income households, which will enable all Peel residents to remain in their communities (5.8.2.3), to construct and retain rental housing (5.8.2.5) and to establish minimum new housing unit targets that are affordable in secondary plans 'where appropriate, to ensure a diverse mix of housing type and tenure (5.8.2.10) and to implement the annual minimum new housing unit targets (5.8.2.13) and through the use of various initiatives, including the Region of Peel Municipal Housing Facility By-law, in partnerships with the private and non-profit housing sectors develop and implement new affordable housing (6.2.2.16). The Region to collaborate with the local municipalities to implement the annual minimum new housing unit targets, they are set at 17% for social housing, 3% for affordable rental, 35% for market rental and affordable ownership and 45% for market ownership (5.8.2.12). The Region plans to review and update, jointly with the local municipalities, the annual minimum new housing unit targets as defined in policy 5.8.2.12 (5.8.2.14), and maintain, monitor, evaluate and refine the centralized waiting list for all social housing units in Peel Region (6.2.2.11).

Summary of Findings: The analysis identified 29 policies related to smart development. York's Regional Centres and Corridors were found to have all the characteristics of smart development, that is, provisions for mixed uses, high densities, centralized common areas, distributed and accessible open space, health care and recreational facilities, and an integrated system of walkways, bikeways and transit. Local Centres and Corridors, and Designated Greenfie1ds had all the provisions of smart development except provisions for high densities. New Community areas were missing provisions of high density and integrated bikeways. Retail Specific areas had all the provisions except open space, health care and recreational facilities. Intensification areas were missing provisions for mix use, high density and integrated walkways and bikew"ays.

The smart development provisions that occurred most frequently included public spaces, integrated walkways and transit followed by recreational facilities and open spaces. The smart development provisions, which had the lowest presence, included high density and integrated bikeways, although, the Region and the GGH Growth Plan established density targets, and York has its own Bicycle Access Plan.

York Region, as part of the Growth Plan for GOH requirements, has created York Region 2031 Intensification Strategy to achieve intensification and the intensification targets (5.3.2) and requires local municipalities to base their own intensification strategies based on the Region's strategy (5.3.3). And that planning and implementation oflocal centres and corridors shall be consistent with the intensification policies of Section 5.3 (Intensification) of the ROP (5.5.5). In addition, the Region \\'ill work with local municipalities to identify opportunities for the intensification of existing retail (4.4.2). Lastly, the Region prohibits the approval oflocaI municipal plan and zoning by-law amendments that would have the effects of reducing the density of a site in areas that have been approved for medium- or high-density development, unless the need is determined through a municipal comprehensive reviev~' (3.5.23). To encourage employment intensification and higher density employment uses in Regional Centres and Corridors, in support of the policies in Section 5.4 (Building Complete Communities) of this Plan (4.3.19). The Region also requires flexible and adaptable employment lands which allow for redevelopment and intensification (4.3.16) and to review and monitor opportunities for employment land intensification (4.3.17).

141

Comprehensive secondary plans to include and meet the minimum density requirements and targets established by the Region and the Province are required for Regional Centres and key development areas along the Regional Corridors (5.4.6), and wiLhin the designated greenfield areas, that are not completely built, the plans are should be re-examined to determine whether the minimum targets in the developable area can be achieved (5.2.15). Together, the Province and local municipalities, will establish common density and intensification measurements, definitions and monitoring tools (5.2.18). Additional policies: 4.3.18. To require local municipalities to conduct 5-year reviews of employment lands to accommodate employment intensification. 5.6.20. That new development areas within TO,\\TIS and Villages, be subject to comprehensive secondary plans based on the following: · water and wastewater services are available; · the plan considers the entire Town or Village and integrates the development into the existing community; · best efforts to achieve a minimum density requirement of 50 residents and jobs combined per hectare in the developable area; · best efforts are made to incorporate policies 5.6.4 through 5,6.16 (new community areas prioritize people, sustainability, · and livability) of this Plan; and, · best efforts to encourage development within the built-up area of the To~ns and Villages that is consistent with the appropriate policies in Section 5.3 (intensification) of this Plan. 5.6.26. That residential infilling shall be encouraged to occur in depth rather than along strips and should complement the historic character of the settlement.

identification and strategic protection of environmentally sensitive and biologically significant open spaces in the region and corridors to connect them by prohibiting development in these spaces

1.0 Identification - the WHAT. The Region has identified the following areas as environmentally sensitive and biologically significant open spaces and corridors: A. Regional Greenland System - consists of cores, corridors, and linkages. These include the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan Natural Core Area and Natural Linkage Area designations, the Natural Heritage System within the Protected Countryside of the Greenbelt Plan, key natural heritage features, key hydrologic features and functions, and the lands necessary to maintain these features within a system (2.1.2) A1.0 Components of the Regional Greenland System (2.2.1) consists of key natural heritage features and key hydrologic features and include: a. significant habitat of endangered species, threatened species and special concern species (the species at risk in Ontario List); b. fish habitat~ c. wetlands; d. Life Science Areas of Natural and Scientific Interest; e. Environmentally Significant Areas; f. significant valley lands; g. significant woodlands; h. significant wildlife habitat; i. sand barrens, savannahs and tallgrass prairies; j. lakes and their littoral zones; k. permanent and intermittent streams; 1. kettle lakes; m. seepage areas and springs; and, n. Lake Simcoe Shoreline. A2.0 Key natural heritage and hydrologic features shall be identified in accordance with criteria provided by Province on a site by site basis or through appropriate studies (2.2.3) A2.1. That Environmentally Significant Areas on the Oak Ridges Moraine or within the Natural Heritage System of the Protected Countryside of the Greenbelt Plan, which have been identified by a conservation authority, are also considered to be key natural heritage features, subject to the same requirements for protection and study as those identified in the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plun and Greenbelt Plan for Life Science Areas ofNalural and Scientific Interest (2.2.24). A3.0 That th(~ Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan, identifies land use d,esignations and permitted uses,

143

including the following: a. Natural Core Areas have a high concentration of key natural heritage features, key hydrologic features, andJor landform conservation areas and are critical to maintaining the integrity of the Moraine as a whole. New permitted uses are very limited and may include conservation and resource management, low . intensity~recreation, or agricultural uses, as detailed in the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan. b. Natural Linkage Areas form part of a central corridor system that supports or has the potential to support movement of plants and animals between the Natural Core Areas, Natural Linkage Areas, river valleys and stream corridors. Limited new uses may include those permitted in the Natural Core Area designation, as well as mineral aggregate operations and wayside pits, as detailed in the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan.

B. Local Greenland System ~ Local municipalities to develop local Greenland systems that identify enhancement areas and linkage opportunities in existing (2.1.4) and new communities (2.1.11). Bl.0 Local municipalities to identify key features in local official plans and zoning by laws (2.2.8). B2.0 That in the Urban Area and Towns and Villages, the Regional Greenlands System shall be identified more specifically in local official plans and secondary plans and integrated into community design (2. 1.9).

C. Wetlands as identified by the Province, provincially significant wetlands. The Province has enacted a policy statement under the Planning Act that prohibits development in provincially significant wetlands. Other wetlands that have not been identified as provincially significant, but which have been formally evaluated by the Ministry of Natural Resources, also exist within the Region. Map 4 shows the general location of all evaluated wetlands, as well as identified wetlands within the Oak. Ridges Moraine, Greenbelt, and Lake Simcoe watershed. More detailed information, as well as more recent wetland evaluations is available from the Province. (Section 2.2). D. Woodlands - significant woodlands study performed E. Oak. Ridges Moraine, Greenbelt and Lake Simcoe. F. The landform conservation areas within the Oak. Ridges Moraine are shown on Figure 1 (2.2.51). G.

2.0 Identification through Studies
· · · · · To examine the feasibility of undertaking studies complementary to the Regional Greenlands System, such as wildlife and terrestrial linkage plans (2.1.26). To work with conservation authorities, local municipalities and the Province in establishing, maintaining and improving a database on the Regional Greenlands System (2.1.27). To work with municipal partners and stakeholders in implementing and monitoring the Rouge North Management Plan (2.1.28). To cooperate with conservation authorities, province, local municipalities to further defined and better understand key features and their functions. (2.2.12) Specific studies can be used to determine/verifY the significance of woodlands (2.2.41).

Sl!mmal'l' of Findin~s ([!If-l1liry dU" "hat nnd Shltiies}: The Region identified the following areas requiring protection: Regional and Local Greenland Systems, and \vithin them key natural heritage and hydrologic features, natural core and linkage areas, significant woodlands, natural heritage system, protected country side, wetlands, landform area, water systems within and outside Oak Ridges Moraine, the Greenbelt area and Lake Simcoe (A·G). In addition, lands designated as Agricultural Area, Rural Area or Urban Area in this Plan that are also part of the Natural Heritage System in the Greenbelt Plan are subject to the Regional Greenlands System policies of Section 2.1 (Regional Greenland system) of this Plan, and are intended to function as part of the Regional Greenlands System in the long term (6.1.5). The Region has also identified a number of studies which will aid in the identification and protection of environmentally significant areas, they consist of having a database of the Regional Greenlands System (2.1.27), to define and understand key features and their functions (2.2.12), studies to conform significant woodlands (2.2.41) and to examine the feasibility to unde11ake more studies such as wildlife and terrestrial linkage plans in the Regional Greenland System (2.1.26). Lastly. the Region has specified that they will implement the following plans: Rouge North Management Plan (2.1.28).

3.0 Adjustments to the Identified Areas:
S ecific studies can be used to determine/verif! the 8i nificance of woodJands (2.2.41) but amendment to

Plan not required if woodlands does not meet criteria in 2.2.39 which is as follows: a. contains globally or provincially rare plants, animals or communities as designated by the Natural Heritage Information Centre; b. contains species designated by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada or by the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario as threatened, endangered, or of special concern; c. is \Vithin 30 meters of a key hydrologic feature; d. is over 2 hectares and (i) is within 100 meters of another key natural heritage feature or key hydrologic feature or (ii) occurs \\ithin the Regional Greenlands System. e. is south of the Oak Ridges Moraine and is 4 hectares or larger in size; f. is north of the Oak Ridges Moraine and is 10 hectares or larger in size; or1 g. on the Oak Ridges Moraine the woodland will be evaluated for significance based on the requirements of the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan and associated technical papers. That once the local Greenland system, approved at a local level, revisions to local Greenlands systems will be included within this Plan without amendment (2.1.5). Minor refinements to the extent or presence of key features resulting from studies conducted in accordance with the Greenbelt, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation and Lake Simcoe Protection Plans and information from the province or conservation authority do not require an amendment to the Plan (2.2.23). Region will amend the plan to update provincially significant wetlands (2.2.37) To amend mapping and policies in this Plan when significant recharge areas or vulnerable aquifer areas are identified (2.3.6).
Summary of Findim:s (Adjustments to Environmentally Significant A.'eas): The Region will not amend the Rap if studies or local official plans refine the areas, for example, if a study identifies woodlands but they are not significant (2.2.41 and 2.2.39), when local Greenland system boundaries change during alignment of local official plans to ROP (2.1.5), when minor refinements to the extent or presence of key features (2.2.23). The Region will amend the ROP to update provincially significant wetlands (2.2.37) and when significant recharge areas or vulnerable aquifer areas are identified (2.3.6)

The use of distance from the sensitive area (example: wetland or water shoreline) or minimum vegetation protection zone distances are utilized in the policies. The only activities that are prohibited from the system without any exceptions are batching/asphalt plans and new waste disposal sites.

Region/Local municipalities develop Urban Forest Management Plan that may include significant woodland (2.2.46) Source: 2009 GREENING STRATEGY ACHIEVEMENTS - Report No.3 of the Transportation Services Committee Regional Council Meeting of March 25, 2010: York Region Urban Forest Studies in Vaughan and Markham contribute to a GTA·\\,jde collaboration: In 2009, two Urban Forest Studies were initiated in partnership wit.l-t York Region, the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, the Town of Markham and the City of Vaughan. These studies place a monetary and ecological value on the functions of the urban forest (carbon storage, pollutant uptake, energy use mitigation, etc.). These models have been recognized internationally as critical for directing the management of the urban forest. In addition to Vaughan and Markham, studies are currently underway in the City of Toronto, the Town of Pickering, the Region of Peel, with other GTA municipalities considering undertaking studies in the near future. In December 2009, the Region adopted a new Regional Official Plan. Policy 2.2.46 of the Official Plan requires that local municipalities develop an Urban Forest Management Plan. These urban forest studies provide a strong foundation for the development of an Urban Forest Management Plan. As Vaughan and Markham urban forest studies wrap up, Richmond Hill is expected to be the next municipality to initiate a study in partnership with York Region in 2010.

Summary of I<indings:

York Region had 22 policies related to conserving energy use. Most of the policies, over half, focused on conserving energy in buildings with a focus on new buildings. York Region has 7 voluntary policies out of 22, encouraging local municipalities and developments to exceed energy efficiency standards for existing and all new buildings (5.2.22 and 5.2.27), to provide complementary incentive programs to achieve a successful implementation of LEED~ (Silver, Gold or Platinum standards) buildings across York Region (5.2.24), to undertake mlmicipal-wide Community Energy Plans (5.2.13), to include on-site renewable or alternative energy systems which produce 25% of building energy use for all new buildings - where on-site renewable or alternative energy systems are not feasible, consideration of purchasing grid-source renewable energy is encouraged (5.2.28), to encourage all development to incorporate green roofs into building design (5.2.34) and mitigate heat island effects using green or white roofs, strategic planting of trees, and installing light or solar reflecting materials (5.2.35). New community areas are to be designed to reduce urban heat island effects using the options in 5.2.35 (5.6.16). York Region does require comprehensive secondary plans for Regional Centres and key development areas along Regional Corridors which will include (5.4.6): (a) policies to ensure excellence in urban design and sustainable construction methods, including winter design; (b) requirements to reduce and/or mitigate urban heat island effects, by considering the use of green and white roofs, greening to provide shade and light-colored surface materials; (c) policies that establish urban greening targets, which may be achieved through urban forest canopy, green walls, requirements for on-site greening;

Energy Conservation

York Region is requiring urban designs to consists of buildings that minimize ener,!,'Y use (5.2.8), expect that all new residential and non-residential buildings have energy efficiency standards, depending on the size of the building (storyes), need to equal an Energy Star standard or be designed to achieve 25% greater energy efficiencv than the Model National Energy Code for Buildings (5.2.20). Policy 5.2.22 encourages that

161

industrial buildings be designed to achieve 25% greater energy efficiency than the Model National Energy Code for Buildings. York Region requires local municipalities to develop programs to ensure the successful implementation of the sustainable building policies of this Plan (5.2.42) and supports local municipal initiatives in sustainable community planning and sustainable building policy and implementation to achieve building standards greater than the policies of this Plan and the Ontario Building Code (5.2.43). In addition, York Region requires local municipalities to develop Community Energy Plans for each Regional Centre (5.4.24) and one for each new community area to reduce community energy demands, optimize passive solar gains through design, and make use of renewable, on-site generation and district energy options including but not limited to solar, wind, water, biomass, and geothermal energy (5.6.10). York Region supports renewable and alternative energy systems. The Region permits these systems to be located throughout the Region in accordance with provincial and federal requirements, and that these permissions be incorporated into local official plans and zoning by-laws. Local municipalities shall specify in more detail where renewable and alternative technologies will be permitted (5.2.12). Exceptions are made \vithin the Holland Marsh Specialty Crop Area where provincial and federal requirements '"'ill be followed. In addition, within the Greenbelt area where these systems shall be subject to the policies of the Greenbelt Plan and shall be designed to minimize disturbance on agricultural operations (6.3.17). The Region supports development that will be designed to maximi7e solar gains and be constructed in a manner that facilitates future solar installations (5.2.26 and 5.6.9) York wants water and wastewater facilities to be designed and operated to reduce energy use and, where possible, energy recovery (7.3.28) and to incorporate energy-recovery systems into water and wastewater facilities where possible in order to reduce the health and environmental impacts of greenhouse gas and other emissions on air quality (7.3.27). Outstanding policies: 7.4.19, 7.5.1, 7.5.2, 7.5.8, 7.5.10.7.5.11, 7.5.12,7.5.13 -16 in waste tab 6.4.13.

To assist local municipalities in the review and approval of site management and contingency plans as required by the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan to ensure that land uses do not pose a significant threat to Regional wells in the Oak Ridges Moraine (7.3.47). To regularly review and up'date sustainable building incentive programs within York Region together with local municipalities. These programs may include water and wastewater servicing allocation credits, density bonusing, expedited processing of development approvals or the use oflocal municipal commtmity improvement plans and associated financial tools (5.2.25). Last, to implement Fisheries Management Plnns with province and conservation authorities (2.3.10) The Region had indicated that the natural quality and characteristics of watercourses, lakes, aquatic habitat. .. etc be maintained and development be designed with the goal of maintaining waler balance (2.3.2), and that linkages and related functions among different water systems are to be maintained (2.3.3). TIle Region wishes to provide high-quality, safe, and clean drinking water while protecting surface and groundwater resources by (7.3.19): a. meeting and exceeding watcr quality standards defined by the Safe Drinking Water Act; b. protecting the drinking watcr supply through source water rotection strate ies:

164

c. protecting and enhancing the Region's system oflakes, rivers and streams: d. ensuring groundwater use sustains the long term health of aquifers: e. maintaining and updating the ground\\'ater monitoring program; and, f. identifying source water protection areas.

Summary of Findings: York Region portfolio of water protection, management and conservation consists of 'various "directions" including considering incompatible uses, restricting development and land uses around water sources, implementing various techniques and investigating new technologies, and improving water and waste water facilities. The most common policies were around creating plans (described earlier), suggesting techniques on how to protect and conserve water and the sources followed by restricting activities or land use designations.

The Region will prepare water source protection plans with Province, local municipalities, and conservation authorities to protect the quality and quantity of Regional water supply from incompatible uses and sources of contamination to protect water supply from incompatible uses and sources of contamination (2.3.7). The Region requires local official plans to identifY all Regional wells and intake protection zones to protect drinking water quality (7.3.9). In Wellhead Protection Areas outside of the Oak Ridges Moraine, a Risk Assessment shall be conducted as prescribed by the Clean Water Act, 2006, and a Risk Management Plan developed and approved prior to the establishment of new land uses that imoh'e the storage or manufacture of (7.3.39): a. petroleum-based fuels and or solvents; b. pesticides, herbicides, fungicides or fertilizers; c. construction equipment; d. inorganic chemicals; e. road salt and contaminants as identified by the Province; f. the generation and storage ofhazatdous waste or liquid industrial waste, and waste disposal sites and facilities; g. organic soil conditioning sites and the storage and application of agricultural and non-agricultural source organic materials: and, h. snow stor3ge and disposal facilities.

165

In addition, existing land uses in the same area as 7.3.39 and in areas high potential for groundwater contamination, involve the storage, manufacture or use of materials detailed in policy 7.3.39, a Risk Assessment and a Risk Management Plan may be required (7.3.41). Wellhead Protection Areas within the Oak Ridges Moraine with new land uses \vhich involve the storage, manufacture of materials or uses detailed in policy 7.3.39 are prohibited (7.3.45). Furthermore, the Region will investigate whether there is a need to undertake risk management planning, including spills response, contaminant recovery, aquifer rehabilitation plans and public education in consultation with other partners, "v·here existing land uses involve the storage of contaminants identified in policy 7.339 in Wellhead Protection Areas (7.3.44). The Region prohibits the storage or use of pathogen threats by new land uses, including the siting and development of stormwater management ponds and rapid infiltration basins or columns, except for the storage of manure for personal or family use, wi.thin the 100-metre pathogen zone around each municipal well as shown on Map 6 and may be restricted within the 100-metre to 2-year time of travel (7.3.42). And unless a Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan has been undertaken to the satisfaction of the Region, the expansion of existing incompatible land uses within the IOO-metre pathogen zone is prohibited and the expansion of existing incompatible land uses within the IOO-metre to 5-year time of travel zone will be discouraged. Redevelopment of these uses to more compatible uses is encouraged, subject to an appropriate Risk Assessment and a Risk Management Plan (7.3.43). The Region also prohibits undertaking of animal agriculture and the storage of agricultural equipment for other than personal or family use for new uses within the Oak Ridges Moraine, in the 0-to-2 year time of travel zone the storage of animal manure (7.3.46). Lastly, the Region prohibits or restricts the generation and storage of the following, in areas of high Aquifer Vulnerability (7.3.50): a. hazardous waste or liquid industrial waste; b. waste disposal sites and facilities; c. organic soil conditioning sites and snow storage and disposal facilities; d. underground and above ground storage tanks that are not equipped \vith an approved secondary containment device; and, e. storage of a contaminant listed in Schedules to Ontario regulations.

lh restrict uses: 5.2.31. To restrict the use of potable water for outdoor watering.

The Region focuses on directing development away from sensitive surface and ground,,"ater vv'ater features (2.3.4). Many of the policies restrict development to specific areas, away from sensitive water sources andlor require additional studies to demonstrate that there will be no negative impacts to the area (2.3.5, 7.3.10, 7.3.49). It requires that development have an integrated and innovative approach to ,yater management, be water efficient, and minimize stonnwater volumes and contaminant loads and maximize infiltration through an integrated treatment approach, which may include techniques such as raimvater harvesting, nmoff reduction of solids and materials at source, constructed wetlands, bioretention swales green roofs, permeable surfaces, clean water collection systems, and the preservation and enhancement ~f native vegetation cover (5.2.11). And that development within and expansions to the urban uses within Towns and Villages identified on Map 1 will occur on the basis offull municipal water and wastewater treatment services where such facilities currently exist. For existing or previously approved development in Towns and Villages, water and wastewater treatment services will be continued where feasible and in keeping with the provisions oflocal official plans and this Plan (7.3.15). Lastly, any major development on the Oak Ridges Moraine to conform with watershed plan (2.3.35) and Lake Simcoe watershed located outside of the Oak Ridges Moraine and Greenbelt cannot have new mineral aggregate ops, wayside pits, quarries, ancillary or accessory uses unless permitted in the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan (2.1.24). In addition to plans, restricting uses and development, York Region has a number of policies which offer ways to further protect, enhance and conserve water resources, they include establishing procedures for water taking permits (2.3.12), encouraging agricuIturalland management practices that minimize the application of pesticides and nutrients as well implementing best management practices for integrated pest management, phosphorus reduction, nutrient management and soil and water conservation (2.3.14 and 6.3.14), expecting that the owners and operators of stormwater management works inspect, maintain and monitor effluent quality on a periodic basis (2.3.38), encouraging the use of water efficient, drought resistant landscaping by providing a minimum of 6 inches of topsoil, installing drought resistunt sod, providing landscape features that minimize the demund for water and synthetic chemicals by utilizing native and drought resistant species and installing permeable driveway surfaces (5,2.33), pursue the implementation of water efficiency innovations such as water reuse systems, rainwater harvesting und innovative stonnwater management (7.1.22), to reduce the amount of water used in the Region's construction 1projects (7.1.24), to protect surface water quality by addressing both point and non-point

186

co-operative housing projects and rental housing developments.

Summary of Findings: The Region established affordable housing targets for new housing units for the Region and Regional Centres and key development areas (3.5.6 and 3.5.7), and plans to develop an affordable housing implementation framework to achieve the targets in ROP (3.5.9).
The Region requires that local municipalities permit a mix and range of housing types, lot and unit sizes, and levels of afford ability within each community, which need to meet the intensification and density requirements (3.5.4) and incorporate housing needs into intensification strategies (5.3.3). It also requires that affordable housing initiatives be given priority on suitable publicly o-wned lands (3.5.11) (are these usually Brownfield?) and that optimal sites, particularly in centres and corridors, for affordable housing are identified early in the development process (3.5.17). New community areas need to provide affordable housing (5.6.4), and that all new secondary and comprehensive secondary plans include a strategy to implement affordable housing policies and meet ROP's affordable housing targets (3.5.5 and 5.4.6). Local municipalities are required to protect rental housing with provisions that would prohibit the demolition or conversions, which would result in rental vacancy rate less than 3% in the local municipality (3.5.21). The Region plans to work with local municipalities and the private sectors to consider fmancial arrangements to encourage and support the development and maintenance of affordable housing such as reduced municipal fees and charges (3.5.10) and to work with Housing York Inc to continue to provide affordable housing units (3.5.12). The Region advocates to the Provincial and Federal governments the need for long tenn, stable and flexible funding for the provision and maintenance of affordable housing (3.5.24). Encourage: 3.5.8. To encourage the development of intrinsically affordable housing, which includes modest amenities, standard materials, minimal details and flexibility within units. 35.13. To encourage the construction of new non-profit housing. 3.5.14. To encourage that special needs housing, and emergency, affordable, and seniors' housing be located in proximity to rapid transit and other human services. 3.5.20. To encourage the construction of new rental units with a full mix and range of unit sizes, including family-sized and smaller units. 3.5.18. To encourage building design that will facilitate subsequent conversion to provide additional

187

housing units, such as secondary suites. 3.5.22. To encourage local municipalities to include '"as-of-right" secondary suite policies, on a municipalwide basis, in local official plans and zoning by-laws.

Summary of Findings (Encourage): The Region encourages the private sector and local municipalities to intrinsically develop affordable housing (3.5.8 and 3.5.13) with secondary units (3.5.18 and 3.5.22) and that it will be located close to transit and other human services (3.5.14).

adaptation measures that address such issues as urban heat island effect, infrastructure resiliency, emergency preparedness, vector-borne diseases, and extreme-weather event responses. 3.2.12To work with the Province to increase air quality monitoring stations in York Region and to improve air quality monitoring. 3.2.13. To investigate emissions trading and carbon offsets to finance and showcase clean air initiatives in consultation with the Province and Federal government. 6.3.15. To promote agricultural practices, which minimize impacts on air quality and climate change, such as no-till farming. 7.3.30. That the planning and design of water and wastewater infrastructure will consider potential impacts from climate change. Summary of Findings: Ten policies were coded as adaptive and mitigative policies to protect urban communities from climate change because they had the term "climate change" in the policy statement/description. Four additional policies were also considered as adaptive and mitigative policies to protect urban communities from climate change because they focused on the identification of flood plains/lands, prohibiting development within defined floodplains, planning and designing development to minimize flooding impacts and developing emergency management plans for severe weather events including flooding (2.3.20, 2.3.21,2.3.25,2.3.28). Two of the ten climate change policies also included flood events and flood management as part of the preparations required to manage climate change effects and impacts (2.3.27 and 2.3.29). One of the climate change policies focused on reducing the impact from climate change by promoting agricultural practices which minimize climate change such as no-till farming (6.3.15). The remaining policies focused on preparing for the effects and impacts of climate change by studying and sharing the impacts of climate change and its links to community planning and public health (3.1.6, 3.2.10, 3.2.11, 3.2.7), by putting a climate change adaptation action plan in place (3.2.2), by designing water and wastewater infrastructure which will consider potential impacts from climate change (7.3.30) and overall designing communities that are more resilient to the effects of climate change (3.1.7),

Designated Greenfield Areas: The designated area that was outside of the built-up area as of June 2006 as defined by the Province's Built Boundary in Places to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (Region ofYork, 2009). Employment lands: lands designated for clusters of business and economic activities including, but not limited to, manufacturing, warehousing, offices, and associated retail and ancillary facilities (Region of Peel, 2009). Intensification Corridors: Intensification areas along major roads, arterials or higher order transit corridors that have the potential to provide a focus for higher density mixed-use:: development consistent with planned transit service levels (Ministry of Public Infrastructure Renewal, 2006). Local Centres and Corridors: Local Centres and Corridors are important components of the local urban structure. Local Centres are focal points for residential, human services, commercial and office activities for the surrounding community and playa supporting role to Regional Centres and Corridors and enhance the network of connectivity throughout York Region. Some of these centres include Woodbridge, Downtown Newmarket, Keswick, Old Unionville, and Downto\\-n Richmond Hill. Given the diversity of communities across York Region, Local Centres can vary greatly in size, nature and characteristics. Local Centres are also used to reflect the culture and history ofY ork Region through heritage streetscapes and are the locations for a number of festivals. Certain Local Corridors, which may be Regional arterial streets, in existing and proposed urban areas, have the potential for intensive and mixed-use land development, supported by public transit services. Local Corridors link Regional and Local Centres and may be identified as routes for transit servIces and facilities (Region of York, 2009), Major Transit Station Areas: The area including and around any existing or planned rapid transit station or the area including and around a major bus depot in an urban core. Station

areas are generally defined as the area within an approximate 500 metre radius of a transit station, representing about a IO-minute walk (Region of Peel, 2009).

Regional Centres and Corridors: The Regional Centres are planned as the most important and intense concentrations of development within the Region. They are vibrant urban places for I j"ing, working, shopping, entertainment, cultural identity and human services. The four Regional Centres are strategically located in Markham, Newmarket, Richmond Hill and Vaughan, and are connected along the Regional Corridors to enhance the mobility of people and goods to, from and within these places. These areas will provide a diverse and compatible mix ofland uses, including residential and employment uses, to support vibrant neighbourhoods. These strategic locations are based on an intensification framework that recognizes that the highest density and scale of development will occur in the Regional Centres followed by the Regional Corridors. The Regional Centres and Corridors are the focus of this city building approach to sustainable grO\\1h and place making, and are the foundation of the Region's urban structure (Region of York, 2009). Urban Growth Centres: Urban growth centres are planned (Ministry of Public Infrastructure Renewal, 2006):
· · · · · · as focal areas for investment in institutional and region-wide public services, as well as commercial, recreational, cultural and entertainment uses to accommodate and support major transit infrastructure to serve as high density major employment centres that will attract provincially, nationally or internationally significant employment uses to accommodate a significant share of population and employment grow1h.

Urban Nodes: Urban Growth Centres in Region of Peel (Region of Peel, 2009). Urban System: The Urban System is composed of a variety of communities that contain diverse living, working and cultural opportunities. The Urban System in Peel consists of lands wi.thin the 2031 Regional Urban Boundary as shown on Schedule D of the Regional Official Plan (Region of Peel, 2009).
