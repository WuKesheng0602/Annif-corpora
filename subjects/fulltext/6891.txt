Wind Gust Measuring At Low Altitude using An Unmanned Aerial System

Alton Yeung Masters of Applied Science, Aerospace Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto (2017)

Abstract
A small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was developed with the specific objective to explore atmospheric wind gusts at low altitudes within the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). These gusts have major impacts on the flight characteristics and performance of modern small unmanned aerial vehicles. Hence, this project was set to investigate the power spectral density of gusts observed at low altitudes by measuring the gusts with an aerial platform. The small UAV carried an air-data system including a fivehole probe that was adapted for this specific application. The air-data system measured the local wind gusts with an accuracy of 0.5 m/s by combining inputs from a five-hole probe, an inertial measurement unit, and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers. Over 20 flights were performed during the development of the aerial platform. Airborne experiments were performed to collect gust data at low altitudes between 50 m and 100 m. The result was processed into turbulence spectrum and the measurements were compared with the MIL-HDBK-1797 von K´ arm´ an turbulence model and the results have shown the model underpredicted the gust intensities experienced by the flight vehicle. The anisotropic properties of low-altitude turbulence were also observed when analyzing the measured gusts spectra. The wind and gust data collected are useful for verifying the existing turbulence models for low-altitude flights and benefit the future development of small UAVs in windy environment.

Introduction
1.1 Motivation

Over the last couple of decades, small unmanned aerial vehicles (SUAVs) have been gaining popularity and are becoming more widely used. Traditionally used mainly for military purposes, advanced miniaturized sensors, have led small unmanned aerial vehicles being adopted by the commercial sector, consumer market, and research communities. Small unmanned aerial vehicles are versatile when equipped with a combination of sensors and pre-programmed flight plans to meet the mission requirement such as search and rescue, mapping, environmental studies, aerial imaging, and meteorology [1­5]. Many of these small unmanned aerial vehicles are performing missions at less than half a kilometer above the terrain due to the nature of their missions, engine output capability, and regulatory limitations. For example, several small multi-rotor unmanned vehicles use advanced control algorithms that allow operation and target following at extremely low altitudes of less than several meters above the ground [6]. In many applications, small and mini unmanned aerial vehicles are required to operate in proximity of obstacles, which requires precise control algorithms [1, 2, 7]. These vehicles are sensitive to a gusty environment because of their smaller overall dimensions and inertia. Slower flight speed also means atmospheric turbulence would have greater effects on these small vehicles while not affecting full-sized aircraft [8]. Therefore, atmospheric gusts have a significant impact on flight control and vehicle endurance performance on small and micro UAVs. Previous work has attempted to model autonomous flight under windy conditions [9]. Galway has investigated the effect of turbulent wind generated by buildings on 1

small unmanned aerial vehicles using computational fluid dynamics [10]. The difficulties of describing the turbulence characteristics at low altitudes have been outlined by Watkins [11]. The wind profile within the atmospheric boundary layer is influenced by factors including elevation, time of day, seasons, and terrain roughness. Low altitude winds are also subject to local features, such as buildings and obstacles. A representative model can be used to describe the physical characteristics of the atmospheric wind profile within the atmospheric boundary layer. Such a model can help in improving our understanding of flight characteristics of small unmanned aerial vehicles. Accuracy and reliability of flight performance prediction of small UAVs can be further improved. For example, research has been directed towards extracting energy from atmospheric turbulence by using `gust-soaring' [12]. These studies have shown the possibility of improving the range and endurance of small unmanned aerial vehicles through such an approach. They also pointed out that there are little empirical data on gusts experienced by small UAVs are available in literature. Although the Dryden and von K´ arm´ an models were frequently used to provide the power spectral density of the gust in research papers, they were developed mainly to characterize turbulence encounter by full-scale aircraft [13]. Since there is a lack of validated small scale aircraft turbulence models, researchers especially ones who focus on control system design were forced to adopt Dryden or the von K´ arm´ an gust models which may not be truly descriptive of reality for small aircraft. Hence extra efforts have to be made to validate the results on small scale aircraft which often is out of the scope of these research. Wind and gust data measured at low-altitudes can enhance and update the existing model and benefit the future development of small UAVs in windy environment.

Atmospheric Boundary Layer

The atmospheric boundary layer can be defined as the closest part of the atmosphere that is directly influenced by the earth's surface [14]. In this portion of the troposphere, it is subjected to high energy dissipation caused by atmospheric forces. These forces include frictional drag with earth's surface, heat transfer, pollutant emission, evaporation, etc. In other words, it is highly dependent on the terrain features and the activities taking place on the planet's surface. The atmospheric boundary layer thickness can vary due to the surface roughness of the earth's surface. Therefore as shown in Fig. 1.1, due to the presence of buildings, urban areas would create a thicker boundary layer than the rural counterpart [14, 15]. Moreover, the heating effects of buildings (`urban heat island') creates upward air motion

through buoyancy effect that further increases the thickness of the boundary layer [10]. The boundary layer is also affected by the heat exchange in the atmosphere through out the day, hence, the thickness of the boundary also varies in time. One example of the phenomenon which is related to the time of day is the Early Evening Surface-Layer Transition (EET) which takes place in the first one or two hours after sunset. Temperature drops and wind speed decays abruptly during the transition at the highest rates during the EET [5]. This shows the properties of the atmospheric boundary layer is localized and changes at the timescale of hours. Due to the nature of the applications of SUAVs, these vehicles spend their mission almost exclusively inside this rapidly changing, localized atmospheric boundary layer. Therefore, measuring the properties of low-altitude gust profile can improve the insight of predicting flight performance of UAV flying at in the atmospheric boundary layer. Multiple methods of probing the boundary layer have been used in past studies ranging from fixed based measurement using the sodar (acoustic) wind profiler [16, 17] on a tethered weather balloon and full-size manned aircraft [18­20]. Previous experiments have shown that SUAVs can perform atmospheric boundary layer probing in more cost-effective fashion than equipping full-size aircraft with the advantage of large survey area coverage than ground-fixed equipment can achieve [16, 21]. Thus, an unmanned aerial vehicle with a five-hole probe was developed and has been used as an experimental platform to measure atmospheric wind gusts within the atmospheric boundary layer.

Flying in Gust

For aircraft design and certification, the study of gust and its effect on aircraft is important in two perspectives. This document refers atmospheric turbulence and gust as the positive and negative deviations of the wind velocity about the mean: ¯ u =U -U (1.1)

¯ , for any time where the turbulence deviation u is calculated by subtracting the mean wind velocity, U period from the actual instantaneous velocity, U . The gust component can be positive or negative depends on which the actual wind is faster or slower than the average wind velocity [14]. Consequently, atmospheric gusts also cause fluctuations in other atmospheric properties such as temperature, humidity, and gas concentration. However, for aeronautic applications, the focus is on the wind velocities of the three-dimensional wind field:

(1.2) (1.3) (1.4)

In the field of gust research, the longitudinal turbulence, u , aligns to the mean wind vector as shown in 1.2. The lateral gust turbulence, v , is orthogonal to the direction of mean wind and the vertical axis, w , is defined vertical down [22].

Figure 1.2: The earth-fixed frame aliged to the direction of mean wind.

One of the important aspects of studying gusts is to determine the strength of the gust an aircraft

can encounter on its flight path. In a static load analysis case, gust loading can be related to the maximum aerodynamic turbulence load the aircraft may experience during its flight mission. Moreover, the frequency aspect of a given gust can affect the load cases as it can relate to the natural frequencies of the structure. Therefore when describing a gust load, the frequency and strength of a gust are equally important when considering the dynamic motion of an aircraft. Another aspect is related to stability and control of the aircraft. While traveling through disturbances in the atmosphere, development of control algorithms for navigation and guidance also requires the amplitude and frequency of the gust to be described in mathematical forms or they can also be referred as gust models.

Figure 1.3: Change in angle of attack by upward gust U . [23]

In order to calculate the aerodynamic forces that the aircraft experience gusts during encounter, the gust models get applied onto kinematics equations. For example, as shown in Fig. 1.3, when the aircraft encounters an upward gust of velocity U , the changes in the angle of attack can be approximated:

Finally, the resultant change in load factor caused by the upward gust is derived: U V CL L = W 2W/S

The above equations provide a very crude approximation of the resulting change in lift force and the 5

load factor of an aircraft flying through a gust. In most cases, it is an unrealistic estimate while assuming the aircraft instantly encounters the gust and it is affecting the entire aircraft. However, Eq. 1.7 shows that the change in load factor is inversely proportional to the aircraft's weight. Therefore, gusts have a greater effect on small and lightweight UAVs than aircraft with higher wing loading [23]. A more realistic approach to determine the aircraft response to atmospheric gust field is to include the spatial variations in the gust components. This method provides a direct representation of the gust effects on aircraft's flying qualities. Gusts are represented in terms of the rolling or pitching effects the vehicle experiences caused by the gusts. For example, the vertical gusts can produce a variation in wind velocity along the span-wise direction of the aircraft, causing an effective rolling gust. Similarity, gusts along the X-axis of the aircraft can be causing an effective pitching motion as both cases are illustrated in Fig. 1.4 [24]. The rolling rotary gust pg and pitching rotary gust qg can be related to the vertical gust field wg : wg y wg qg = x

pg =

(1.8) (1.9)

The response to gusts of the aircraft can be computed by including the turbulence forces and moments with the equations of motion. Depends on the application, different types of gust model such as step or sinusoidal function can be incorporated into the state space model. For continuous stochastic turbulence profiles, they can be described with power spectral densities which are shown in Section 1.4.1.

Atmospheric Gust Research

In this section, existing gust models are described and explained their shortfalls, along with the applications of gust models in UAV developments. Also, atmospheric probing and low-altitude gust research done previously are listed to provide an overview of the current development in this research field.

1.4.1

Existing Gust Models

Different models can be used to describe the profile of atmospheric turbulence depending on the application and methodology of the analysis. A one-minus-cosine profile can represent a segment of a larger 6

continuous turbulence profile (Fig. 1.5). This simplified approximation is an example of a discrete gust model. The one-minus-cosine discrete gust model is widely used to evaluate the effects of gusts on an aircraft structure. The gust velocity defined in Eq. 1.10 is included in the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 25.341 to outline the acceptable methods to determine the response of the aircraft to encounters with gusts [26]. U= U0 x 1 - cos 2 H (1.10)

where x is the distance penetrated into the gust in feet and H is the distance in feet between the start of the gust to the point where the gust is at its peak velocity. The value U0 is the design gust velocity which varies in strength relative to the flight altitude defined in the regulations. Although discrete gust model provides a simple way to model a subset of atmospheric gust for structural analysis useful 7

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

1.4. ATMOSPHERIC GUST RESEARCH

when determining critical aerodynamic loads [23, 27]. For more detailed and advanced analyses such calculating the dynamic behavior of an aeroelastic structure or validation of a control system algorithm would require a more sophisticated continuous turbulence model. Since a gust is defined as random deviations of wind speed from the mean value, when constructing a statistical model of wind gusts, it is considered to be a stochastic process. In gust measurement and modeling, it is practical to assume the statistical properties of the gusts are stationary and homogeneous [14, 24, 28]. A continuous gust field can be represented by power spectral density (PSD), a distribution of power across the frequency spectrum. By describing the gust field in frequency domain, a whole spectrum can be fitted into a mathematical modal compared to a single wavelength discrete-gust model. Therefore the two commonly used turbulence models, von K´ arm´ an and Dryden, use the power spectral density to model the continuous gust fields. Both models are widely used in applications such as flight simulation and control system design [22]. While, the spectral density modeled by the Dryden turbulence model is still heavily used in control algorithm research because it is able to derive the exact filter for the Dryden spectrum when the filter can only be approximated with the von K´ arm´ an spectrum [28]. However, the von K´ arm´ an turbulence model allows a better fit to previously observed data [25]. The mathematical expressions of the von K´ arm´ an power spectral density function () for longitudinal gust and transverse gust (vertical or lateral) are shown in equations 1.11 and 1.12 respectively.

where  is the turbulence intensity and L is the length scale parameter of the turbulence. The  can also be described as the root mean square value of the gust velocities and he value of L describes the scale of the turbulence patch. To apply the appropriate parameter settings to the von K´ arm´ an model, empirical data from the Military Specification MIL-F-8785C is often used [29]. These empirical expressions relate the turbulence intensity and length scale of the turbulence with altitude and mean wind speed. Fig. 1.6 shows an example of a von K´ arm´ an power spectral density plot with turbulence intensity of 1 ft/s and length scale parameter of 2500 ft. The common practice is to draw the power spectral density function, (), against the spatial frequency,  on a logarithmic scale. The power spectrum density curves 8

produced by the von K´ arm´ an turbulence model have a knee and a straight line segment. The length parameter, L, determines where the power spectrum density curve occurs. The staright line will always have a -5/3 slope at the higher frequencies matching Kolomogorov's -5/3 power law [21].

Figure 1.6: Von K´ arm´ an and Dryden gust power spectral density curves, L = 2500 ft [25].

These results are based on the early effort by the U.S. military in studies of flying qualities and later adopted by aircraft manufacturers and government agencies to use on aircraft design and certification. In the Military Handbook MIL-HDBK-1797 published in 1997 reiterates the model given in with minor adjustment [30]. Since this latest model had been widely used on full-sized manned aircraft design, it will be used to compare against the experimental data in Chapter 4. To recall from Section 1.3, gusts across a period of time have a mean value of zero because of its normally distributed fluctuations. The standard deviation of the gust velocities can be calculated by

the root-mean-square (RMS) value, also known as the intensity of the gust. The gust intensity can be evaluated with Eq. 1.13 where N is number of samples taken in the data and g is the gust velocity.

Gust model under different altitudes and weather scenarios can be described in statistical model by applying different gust intensities and exceedance probability at varies altitude and mean wind speed specified in the Military Handbook MIL-HDBK-1797 as shown in Fig. 1.7. The handbook also suggests that the free atmosphere at altitudes above 2000 feet can be considered isotropic. Hence, the assumption of equal turbulence intensities through out all three directions where u = v = w while the assumption does not apply to altitudes below 2000 feet which is within in atmospheric boundary layer. For altitude below 1000 feet, the MIL-HDBK-1797 provides a sets of empirical equations to model the turbulence intensities and the scale length parameters [30]. The vertical turbulence intensity, w , of the lowaltitude model provided by the handbook is defined in terms of the mean wind speed at 20 feet above 10

Objective

The research objective is to gather experimental wind gust data at altitudes below 200 m, compare the result with existing gust models, and discuss the effectiveness of using existing models for developing small unmanned aerial vehicles. In order to fulfill this goal, the tasks include:
 design and construct a radio-controlled aircraft suitable for low-altitude meteorological sensing.  The aircraft needs to be able to fly autonomously and follow programmed flight path with an

onboard autopilot system. Flight testing has to be done to ensure the aircraft can perform flight missions as designed.
 Mount and calibrate the air-data sensors on the flight vehicle.  Extract wind-gust data from the experimental data adn compare the data with analytical models.

Chapter 2 outlines the methodology of the flight experiments and the equipment used. The wind tunnel and in-flight testings are presented in Chapter 3 with results discussed in Chapter 4. Finally, Chapter 5 contains the conclusion of the project and recommendations for future work.

Methodology
2.1 Atmospheric Turbulence Experiment

In the past, various types of platforms have been utilized in order to measure atmospheric turbulence within the atmospheric boundary layer. The three major platforms that are commonly used by meteorological researchers are tower-based platform, manned aircraft, and unmanned aircraft and each of these methods were developed for different experiment duration, coverage, and sensitivity.

2.1.1

Instrument Platforms

The tower-based platform is often used for atmospheric boundary layer research as they range from a 30 m mast to a to 200 m tall tower to perform surface layer measurement in the air. In some cases, making measurement at one point over a long time period is preferable as capturing a snapshot picture of a large region of space at a specific instant in time seems impractical. Therefore, the `picture' of the boundary layer observation can be composed by using a time record of the measurement as the air blows past the sensors over time.

Figure 2.1: Examples of atmospheric research platform.

Tower-Based Platform Tower-based platforms are ideal for these type of long-term measurement at a specific location and various altitudes can be measured simultaneously with equipment mounted at different levels on the mast or tower. A typical mast height is 10 m to 50 m and can be erected at relatively inexpensive cost [14]. Some tall expensive towers have been erected which can reach the height of over 200 m. Example include the 280 m Hamburg Boundary Layer Measurement Tower in Germany (Fig 2.1a) [32]. Although these tall towers can reach higher altitudes, which is desirable for coverage of flight altitudes of small unmanned vehicles, construction of such tall structure would be costly and time-consuming. The large structure and its support wires can disturb the flow close to the tower. Therefore in most setups, multiple horizontal booms are extended out from the tower to capture the undisturbed airflow in the upwind direction which further increases the cost of performing such experiment.

14

CHAPTER 2. METHODOLOGY Manned Aircraft

2.2. GUSTAV AERIAL RESEARCH PLATFORM

Manned aircraft ranging from ultra-light to multi-engine transport aircraft had also been used in the past to perform boundary layer meteorology research. One example is the DLR research aircraft Falcon 20E (Fig 2.1b) which is able to conduct atmospheric measurement with the onboard LIDAR and other optical instruments [32]. To collect data of boundary layer, typical flight mission consists of level horizontal flight in `L' or `race-course patterns. Usually, sensors are mounted forward to the nose of the aircraft to get the instruments out of the disturbed flow due to the aircraft itself. In some cases, passive instruments such as doppler radar/lidar/sodar are also mounted on the side of the aircraft. Compare to a fixed platform, an airborne platform has coverage areas which are orders of magnitude larger than a tower based system can offer and can perform measurement at the higher altitude of above 300 m. The larger manned aircraft allow heavier instruments to be onboard along with engineers and scientists to perform real-time analysis. Drawbacks of unitizing manned aircraft platform include high setup and operating costs. Moreover, since typical aircraft operate at speed of 50 to 100 m/s, the turbulence sensors onboard must have a correspondingly fast response in order to gather data with robust statistics.

Unmanned Aircraft Recently, with the development of miniaturized airborne sensors and increasingly realizable autonomous flight control system, unmanned aerial vehicles have become a major tool used in atmospheric research. Many UAVs are capable of reaching altitude of over 1000 m with a payload of various shapes and sizes. UAVs provide advantages of an airborne platform at drastically lower cost compare with manned aircraft platform. Moreover, electrically powered UAVs are especially suitable for doing atmospheric measurement as exhaust gas from internal combustion engine can cause problems on measuring gas composition. Unmanned vehicles can also perform flights a lot closer to the ground, which is beneficial to low-altitude gust measurement. UAVs can maintain flight path at altitude as low as 25 m above ground, which is considered to be too low and dangerous for a manned aircraft.

2.2

GustAV Aerial Research Platform

The primary objective was to build a radio-controlled unmanned aerial vehicle that provides an experimental platform for an air-data system in order to measure the wind fields. The aircraft has to carry the 15

meteorological instrument while performing autonomous flight missions with an endurance of 25 minutes. It was determined that existing consumer products from radio-controlled airframe manufacturers were unsuitable for the mission and payload. The Gust Aerial Vehicle, or GustAV, is shown in Fig. 2.2. It is a fixed-wing model aircraft with a conventional configuration. Figure 2.3 shows the three-view outline of the design.

Several modifications were applied to the wing and stabilizers in order to improve handling qualities and the structure integrity of the aircraft. GustAV has a wing span of 2.54 m at an operational weight of 7.52 kg. The airframe was made with balsa wood structure with fiberglass skin reinforcement, which made it unusually strong and heavy for a UAV. This was to maximize the longevity of the airframe against the repeating grass landing and flying in strong and turbulent wind. The primary objective of the GustAV airframe is to provide an aerial platform to perform atmospheric gust measurements at low altitudes. The summary of specification and performance of GustAV are listed in Table 2.1. The design of GustAV was inspired by the radio-controlled model aircraft built by the Ryerson Aero Design student team in 2016. Sharing similar design parameters and manufacturing methods sped up the development process of GustAV and allowed the research to be focused on the experiment. However, modifications of the designs was still to be made to adopt the atmospheric sensors and extra avionics which were not incorporated in the original design. To complete the GustAV experimental platform, the airframe had to be integrated with sensing hardware. The avionics package was required to be robust and efficient by balancing the cost, power consumption, and mass. There are two types of electronic equipment, first is the flight control avionics which controls the aircraft. This part of the system provides the autonomous flight capability and communication for in-flight system monitoring. Most of the flight control system consists of commercial off-the-shelf components. However, customizations were done on both hardware and software levels in order to achieve the specific goals of this project. The second type of electrics onboard GustAV supports the scientific research goal of this thesis, to measure the atmospheric gust at altitudes. Therefore, a commercially available air-data system, Aventech

17

CHAPTER 2. METHODOLOGY

2.2. GUSTAV AERIAL RESEARCH PLATFORM

AIMMS-30, was integrated in the airframe. The air-data system was made available by Aventech Research Inc. of Barrie, Ontario. Detailed description of the air-data system is listed in Section 2.4. The major elements of this air-data system include a five-hole probe, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The five-hole probe measures the relative inflow angles of the local flow field. Along with the data measured the GNSS receivers and IMU, the direction and magnitude of the wind can be determined by performing data filtering and reference frame transformation. Challenges associated with the integration of the air-data system included significant weight reduction that had to be made to the air-data system as it was originally designed for full-sized aircraft. The datasheet provided by Aventech Research Inc. is included in Appendix 4 which outlines specifications of the air-data system.

Figure 2.4: Isometric drawing of GustAV structure layout and major components.

2.2.1

Aircraft Configuration

GustAV consists of a balsa wood structure on an aluminum frame, to which the wing, landing gears, tail, and the motor are mounted (Fig. 2.4). The main wing is reinforced with fiberglass skin in order to minimize bending during flight and reduce the chance of damage during ground handling. The modular construction allows the airframe to be taken apart for transportation and regular maintenance. The 18

CHAPTER 2. METHODOLOGY

2.2. GUSTAV AERIAL RESEARCH PLATFORM

main fuselage can be accessed from the top or at the rear in order to easily install and remove the batteries between flight missions. Along with the batteries, the avionics are enclosed inside the fuselage. As part of the air-data system, two GNSS antennas and a five-hole probe are mounted on the main wing. The technical drawings of the five-hole probe are included in Appendix 4.

2.2.2

Propulsion

GustAV has a Scorpion SII-4020-420KV brushless motor (Fig. 2.5a) that is mounted at the nose of the aircraft. It is rated at approximately 900 Watts while running at full throttle. The motor has a machined aluminum housing. The rear threaded mounting holes are used to attach the motor to dedicated mounting points on the motor mount. The electrical wires are rated to operate at 180°C (356°F) in order to reduce the risk of overheating the motor windings at high power output. The motor operates at 450 RPM/volt. The outer diameter of the motor is 48.9 mm and body length of 46.15 mm. The motor is rated for maximum continuous current and power of 70 Amps and 1500 Watts respectively. The total weight of the motor is 288 g.

GustAV has a 14 inch 3-blade glass fiber reinforced propeller by Master Airscrew (Fig. 2.5b).The thrust output can be expressed as thrust-to-weight ratio of the aircraft. It affects several factors of the flight performance, such as takeoff, climb, and turning performance. The motor and propeller were

19

2.2. GUSTAV AERIAL RESEARCH PLATFORM

tested in the large wind-tunnel at Ryerson University and the performance was measured at various flow velocities. The thrust, torque, and mechanical power output were measured during the test. Results can be find in Appendix 3.

2.2.3

Power Storage

The power source of main propulsion system consists of two Lithium-Polymer batteries, commonly used on radio-controlled aircraft and various UAS systems for its high energy density and high discharge performance. The main battery has capacity of 8000 mAh at nominal voltage of 22.2 V to power the electric brushless motor and the avionics battery has capacity of 2200 mAh at 11.1 V to power the flight control system and air-data sensors required for the experiment. A diagram describes the power system on GustAV is shown in Fig. 2.7. The front face of the main battery locates in the payload bay and weighs 1080 g. The length, width, and height of the battery are 203 mm, 51 mm, and 54 mm respectively. The battery capacity had to be carefully considered in the early stage of the development because 1) it dictates the mission endurance of the aircraft since GustAV is fully electrically powered, and 2) the main battery is the single heaviest part of the aircraft and affects greatly on the aircraft weight and balance. Therefore, it has to be carefully incorporated with other components inside the fuselage to ensure a safe center of gravity location. As part of the safety precaution, the main battery is equipped with a quick access shunt plug which is in place only when the aircraft is in flying mode. With the shunt plug disconnected during vehicle inspection and after each flight to prevent the main motor from spinning up accidentally during the handling of the vehicle and causing damage or injury. As shown in Fig. 2.7, the remaining system such as autopilot module, control surface servo motors, and air-data system are powered by the avionics battery. This setup allows onboard electronics to operate in separation from the high current circuit. The avionics battery was sized to supply power to the system of one hour, significantly longer endurance than the main battery. This is to ensure in an unlikely event of the main battery is fully discharged mid-flight, the avionics battery would still have the capability to supply power to the rest of the system. Therefore the control system and communication link would allow the aircraft to be landed in gliding mode. To further mitigate the risk of emptying the battery prematurely during the flight mission, voltage and current draw of both batteries are monitored by sensors and the readings are sent to the ground 20

The position of the batteries is also an important issue in the design process as the batteries will have to be swapped between flight missions as each battery can take up to three hours to recharge. Therefore, the rear of the fuselage structure is kept open to allow access to the main battery. The main battery is also secured by an aluminum bolt where it anchors the battery from sliding out of the fuselage during the flight mission.

2.2.4

Autopilot and Flight Control System

A Pixhawk autopilot system, as shown in Fig. 2.8, was integrated in the airframe in order to provide navigation, control, and data telemetry functions during the in-flight experiments. The Pixhawk autopilot system consists of a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver, magnetometer, inertial measurement unit, telemetry transceiver, barometric pressure sensor, and pitot-static airspeed sensor. Detailed specifications of the Pixhawk flight controller is included in Appendix 4. An Ardupilot, opensource flight controller software package was installed onto the Pixhawk onboard 168 MHz processor and command all the digital servo motors that actuates the control surfaces of the aircraft. There are three operation modes to control GustAV: manual, fly-by-wire, and autonomous mode. The manual mode allows the pilot to control via direct inputs to the control surface servo motors. Takeoff and landing of the aircraft are always performed in manual mode to ensure full control of the aircraft. The fly-by-wire control mode provides assistance and stabilization to the flight controls. This mode has been valuable as it was used to verify the flight performance of the aircraft during early testing. The aircraft will maintain the roll and pitch angles specified by the pilot control stick inputs and stay within

pre-defined flight envelope such as high and low-speed limits. Lastly, the autonomous mode is used during atmospheric gust measuring experiment. GustAV can follow pre-programmed flight mission including speed following and altitude change with the onboard IMU, GNSS and airspeed sensor. The autonomous mode allows GustAV to fly towards a waypoint, loiter within defined radius, climb, and descent. Once the flight mission is completed, it will return and loiter above the specified home position until the pilot regained control. The flight mission can be monitored and modified via telemetry data-link at the ground control station. A commercially available and relatively inexpensive Bix3, which is shown in Fig. 2.11, was used in order to gather experience with the Pixhawk autopilot before using the autopilot on GustAV. The Bix2 has a wingspan of 1.55 m was used as an early test platform for the autopilot system. The Bix3 is constructed with high-density foam with carbon-fibre reinforced structure. It is durable, versatile, and has a payload capacity of approximately 7x7x15 cm. During the test, electronics equipment included the Pixhawk autopilot system, a GPS receiver, and a telemetry radio transceiver were placed in the payload bay as shown in Fig. 2.12. A pitot-static tube is also mounted on the wing to measure the airspeed of the aircraft during the flights. The Bix3 is equipped with a 3-cell 2200 mAh to supply power to the motor and avionics about 10 minutes. Simple flight patterns were flown in order to gain experience with the avionics and ground control station data-link. A total of 11 flights took place at TEMAC during the 23

summer of 2016. These tests involve maneuvers of flight mission following, loitering around a waypoint, maintaining a constant airspeed, and changing altitude at a specific rate. By doing the avionics tests on a smaller and commercially available test platform, the risk was isolated from the experimental aircraft GustAV.

2.2.5

Airspeed Sensor

In order for the autopilot system to obtain accurate airspeed readings, GustAV is equipped with a pitotstatic airspeed sensor on its left wing. This pitot-static tube is only used for navigation and not used as part of the air-data system for atmospheric measurement that is described in Section 2.4. As shown in Fig. 2.13, the pitot-static tube is mounted in the wingtip of GustAV. The probe is attached to two pressure transducer that are located inside the wing structure. The transducers that are powered by the Pixhawk autopilot, measure the differential pressure between the pressure tabs and the ADC converts the raw pressure analog reading into digital signal which gets transmitted to the Pixhawk autopilot module via I2C databus as shown in Fig. 2.9.

Flight Data Logging

The Pixhawk autopilot system records over 150 flight parameters onto the onboard micro SD card. The data log files are formatted as a binary file to optimize data storage space. Critical flight parameters such as the velocity, attitude, and position of the aircraft are recorded at 50 Hz. Other flight status parameters such as battery voltage and current are being recorded at a slower rate of 10 Hz. After each flight, the flight data files are downloaded from the autopilot system and analyzed using Mission Planner and custom-made MATLAB scripts. One of the most important tasks during the flight vehicle development is the autopilot control pa25

rameter tuning which is discussed in detailed in Section 3.2.3. The objective of the tests is to adjust the PID parameters of the flight control system until the desired flight control response is achieved. The test result can only be revealed by analyzing the flight data log after the flight.

2.2.7

Software in the Loop

One of the useful features which the Ardupilot flight control software offers is the ability to run Softwarein-the-loop (SITL) test on a computer flight simulator setup. In this setup, the flight control software uses sensor data from a flight dynamics model in the flight simulator [35]. Fig. 2.14 shows the simulation model of GustAV running on a computer where flight planning and system familiarization can be done. Before each flight experiment, the mission was programmed onto the SITL simulation and tested in the simulation environment. The proposed flight mission plan was thoroughly tested in the SITL environment before being finalized and sent to the aircraft onboard autopilot.

Ground Control Station

Part of the unmanned aerial system is a bi-directional data link which provides real-time telemetry at the ground control station (GCS) with a pair of radio transceivers. This setup provides the aircraft's position, orientation, velocity, and trajectory on a Microsoft Surface laptop with touchscreen operating the flight monitoring software (Fig. 2.15). The Microsoft Surface was selected for this setup because of the touchscreen interface provides convenient ways to interact with the Mission Planner software during the flight mission. For example, the map view with the flight trajectory being superimposed on top of a satellite image can be navigated with finger gestures. Other advantages such as bright display and long battery life make the Microsoft Surface a good candidate for outdoor flight experiment field operation (Fig. 2.16). The Mission Planner, a flight monitor software, provides the ability to monitor the aircraft status in real-time (Fig. 2.17). The flight mission can also be modified via this setup if necessary. As a safety precaution, the ground control station provides a backup control link in case the main 2.4 GHz radio control frequency had experienced failure. To achieve this 915 Mhz data-link as shown as part of the control system block diagram in Fig. 2.9, both the aircraft and the computer have to equip with the radio modem.

The telemetry data-link is transmitted on the 915 MHz spectrum which is suitable for short-range audio and video transmissions. The transceivers used on the GustAV system outputs at 1 W and adequate for a range of more than 10 kilometers. A pair 100 mW transmitter was originally used, however, the telemetry link was performance was unstable and transmission rate was substantially slower while the aircraft was operating in the air. Although GustAV only operates within the pilot's line-of-sight, an extra range available on the 1 Watt transceivers were preferred to increase the reliability of the communication system.

Air-Data System

The air-data system, AIMMS-30, on GustAV is responsible of measuring the three dimensional wind vector while the aircraft is flying. The system designed by Aventech Research Inc. consists of three types of sensors: a wing mounted five-hole probe to measure the three dimensional flow field, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to measure the accelerations and orientation of the vehicle, and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) units to measure the position and velocity of the aircraft relative to the ground. By combining the signals from the sensors and compute the reference frame transformations 28

CHAPTER 2. METHODOLOGY

2.4. AIR-DATA SYSTEM

(Fig. 2.18), the air-data system is capable of measuring atmospheric gusts of 0.5 m/s [36].

Figure 2.18: Wind measurement reference frames.

The main circuit board of the AIMMS-30 air-data system hosts two Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a processor, and a data logger. The length, width, and height of the main circuit board are 120 mm, 95 mm, and 30 mm respectively. The main circuit board is positioned inside the main payload bay of the aircraft close to the center of gravity and other onboard electronics. Other major components include the five-hole probe on the right wing and GNSS antennas. The block diagram of the air-data system in Fig. 2.19 shows the list of sensors and the connections of the system. To transform the raw measurement of the IMU, GNSS, and five-hole probe into global wind vector, Kalman filter is used which uses the GNSS position and velocity measurements to predict the error caused by the IMU drift and the algorithm can operate either on the onboard hardware or in the post-processing program. The estimated error state is then being fed back to the IMU time-marched kinematics integration to correct the drift. The aircraft's velocity solution provided by this Kalman filter setup retains the fast data of the IMU (100 Hz) while greatly improving the accuracy of the IMU measurements with GNSS solutions. In the event of losing GNSS signal which is required at 1 Hz to update the error state, the IMU kinematics integration continues to function without interference. The error state would be updated again when the GNSS solution once again becomes available to the Kalman filter. This ensures robustness of the system and increases the chance of success. Fig. 2.20 shows the block diagram of the Kalman filter and data transformation

Five-Hole Probe

Multi-Hole pressure probes are frequently used in experiments that are required to measure the aerodynamic flow angles [37]. Fig. 2.21 shows the tip of a five-hole probe and the probe can measure the flow direction and velocity. The Pressure ports are placed around the spherical head of the probe. Each pressure tab is connected to a pressure transducer.

Figure 2.21: Five-hole probe and the flow angles, modified from [37].

The differential pressure measurement between the opposite pressure ports along with the pitot-static pressure can be correlated to compute the angle of attack, , and angle of sideslip,  , relative to the three-dimensional flow field [38­40]. These differential pressure readings show a linear relationship to the inflow angles up to about ±15 degrees and wind tunnel testing has been done and shown in section 3.1. These probes come in different sizes and probes with five, seven, or more ports are available depends on the application. Besides the multi-hole probe (Fig. 2.22a), other types of anemometers were considered to be placed on GustAV to measure the wind velocity and direction. Alpha-Beta vanes (Fig. 2.22b) consist of two vanes which pivot in orthogonal directions to provide the direction of the air flow and a pitot static tube 31

CHAPTER 2. METHODOLOGY

2.4. AIR-DATA SYSTEM

to measure the wind velocity. However, the vane type sensors are more capable of measuring mean wind value than the turbulent fluctuation which is more capable to be measured by fast-response sensors. Hot wire anemometer (Fig. 2.22c) is a type of fast-response sensors which can provide wind velocity by measuring the electrical current needed to maintain the temperature of wire against cooling of wind. It is common to have hot wire set up in a tri-axis configuration to measure the three-dimensional flow field. The hot wire on the anemometer is usually made out of tungsten wire with a diameter of several micrometers. Putting the fragile hot wire on an aerial platform and sustain the takeoff and landing is a challenging task. Lastly, remote sensors that listens to reflected waves (microwave, light, sound) [14]. These are called doppler radar/lidar/sodar (Fig. 2.22d) and depend on that the wave medium the sensors are utilizing. Disadvantages of remote sensors include their size and cost. The antenna or receiver dish required to send and measure the wave signals also add complexity to the system and may not be an ideal choice for operation on an aerial platform.

Figure 2.23: Five-hole probe mounted on the right wing tip of GustAV.

Regardless of the type of flow measuring device, it must be placed strategically to minimize the flow effect influenced by the vehicle in itself which leads to inaccuracy. On GustAV, the five-hole probe is positioned with the intend to minimize any disturbance caused by the aircraft such as the propeller, fuselage, and wing. The five-hole probe was positioned at the wing-tip extending forward in order to measure the flow in front of the wing. Mounting the five-hole probe in front of the airplane's nose was not viable, since the GustAV has a tractor configuration. Therefore, Fig. 2.23 shows the five-hole probe positioned on the right wing tip of GustAV with 3D printed plastic mount, which allows the probe to protrude forward. Further analysis was performed using a potential flow code method to calculate the turning and acceleration of local flow field around the five-hole probe. It is a relatively simple and fast approach to estimate the performance of a complex geometry. This approach employs a higherorder potential flow method that uses elements of distributed vorticity [44]. It provides solutions of the velocity field around the geometry at a relatively low computational expense compared to an approach using CFD. Fig. 2.24a shows the distributed vorticity elements placed to form the half-wing geometry and the relaxed wake shed from the trailing edge. The program calculated the induced velocity field around the geometry within the volume of interest shown in Fig. 2.24b. Finally, the results can be plotted and viewed in slices to reveal the three dimensional flow field (Fig. 2.24c). The probe location was selected using this method which the goal was to minimize the upwash flow effect caused by the lifting surfaces.

Fig. 2.25 and Fig. 2.26 show the predicted offset values of the five-hole probe in angle of attack and angle of sideslip measurements. The finalize probe location is represented by the black cross marker. Fig 2.25a shows the flow field on the XZ plane where the probe is located. The figure illustrates the effect of the upwash represented by the red colour surrounding the wing cross section and placing the air-data probe in that region should be avoided. Fig. 2.26b shows the lateral flow field on the YZ plane and captures the effect of the wingtip vortices: air flowing outboard under the wing and inboard above the wing. To minimized the measurement offset of angle of sideslip, the probe is placed along the spanwise axis of the wing to minimize the crossflow effect. Finally the analysis was repeated across various angles of attack (Fig 2.27) and the measurement offset of the angle of sideslip stays relatively constant while the offset in angle of attack increases. Hence, the flight experiments are conducted with the aircraft flying at 16 m/s or above. In steady level flight, the lift coefficient at 5 degrees angle of attack is equal to 0.45 according to the potential flow analysis.

35

CHAPTER 2. METHODOLOGY

Cruising at speed greater than 16 m/s should allow the aircraft to fly at the angle of attack below 5 degrees to minimize this source of error. Additionally, the results from this analysis can be used to correct the wind measurement data in post-processing to improve the measurement accuracy.

Inertial Measurement Unit

The Aventech AIMMS-30 main circuit board holds an inertial measurement unit. The inertial measurement unit includes a tri-axis accelerometer and a tri-axis gyroscope to measure the accelerations and angular rates of the aircraft during flight. Along with a navigation processor, this type of inertial navigation system can integrate and output position, velocity, and attitude solution of the vehicle at a high-bandwidth (100 Hz) and have relatively low short-term noise [45]. However, any errors in the inertial navigation solution can grow with time as successive sensor errors are summed. Low cost, small size, and light mass inertial measurement units are often used on small UAVs including GustAV. These inertial measurement units are manufactured using micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology which are small in size and have high shock tolerance, their performance is relatively poor compared

36

CHAPTER 2. METHODOLOGY

2.4. AIR-DATA SYSTEM

to higher-cost, larger gyroscope designs. To reduce the measurement error, an error-state Kalman filter is incorporated by Aventech Research Inc. in the AIMMS-30 real-time and post-processing algorithms. The architecture of the IMU/GNSS integrated system is shown in (Fig. 2.20). Note that the Kalman filter error state correction runs at 1 Hz when GNSS solution is available. The Kalman filter estimates the state errors of the IMU by time-marching the kinematic equations of motions along with GNSS velocities and compares to the integral solutions of IMU acceleration and angular rate measurements at 100 Hz.

2.4.3

Global Navigation Satellite System

The air-data system requires velocity and position measurements from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in order to update the error state caused by the drift of the IMU kinematics solution. Although the air-data system setup on GustAV uses solely signals from the Global Positioning System (GPS) operated by the United States, the processing methodology is identical to using geolocation information that is provided by other systems [46]. Therefore, the term GNSS is used to include all available satellite navigation systems. The GNSS solutions provided by the receiver unit can provide horizontal position root-mean-square accuracy of 0.7 m by incorporated signals that the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) broadcasts. WAAS is a satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS) that has ground stations located in North America to provide extra information about the GNSS correction signals, such as clock drift and ionospheric delay, which further improve the GNSS solutions [45]. The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) setup consists of two receivers located on the main circuit board of the Aventech AIMMS-30 air-data system as shown in Fig. 2.19. The corresponding antennas are located on the left and right wing, approximately 2.5 m apart. This dual-antenna setup allows the GNSS system to determine the attitude of the vehicle by measuring the differential carrierphase between the two antennas. The datasheets of the GNSS receivers and antennas are included in Appendix 4. As shown in Fig. 2.28 with the distance between the antennas, rab , is fixed and known, the angle, , between the plane of where the two antennas placed and the satellite line-of-sight can be solved using:

cos  = ab /rab

(2.1)

37

CHAPTER 2. METHODOLOGY

2.4. AIR-DATA SYSTEM

Figure 2.28: Schematic of GNSS attitude determination [45].

The relative range measurement, ab , is equal to the sum of the carrier-phase s that the two GNSS recievers measure and an unknown-multiple of wavelength. This is known as the carrier-phase integer ambiguity problem. To resolve the ambiguity, multiple differential carrier-phase signals from different satellites can be used. Fig. 2.29 shows the ambiguity solution can be found by a geometry technique. The attitude solution lies at the intersection of all four ambiguous range measurements [45]. Usually, magnetometers are used to determine the absolute yaw angle of the vehicle (aircraft's nose heading). However, they are prone to magnetic interference due to onboard avionics, power supply, and the electric motor. This causes measurement error in the aircraft positioning. By measuring the vehicle's attitude using the GNSS antenna pair will result in a better system robustness. The attitude and velocity measurement are updated every second and sent to the Kalman filter estimation algorithm to correct the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) error drift (Fig. 2.20). This allows the unit onboard GustAV to achieve velocity accuracy of less than root-mean-square accuracy of 0.05 m/s [46] for accurate gust measurements during the airborne experiment.

Weather Ground Station

Along the in-flight experiment with the unmanned aerial vehicle platform, the atmospheric properties such as wind speed, wind direction, and temperature have to be monitored by a ground based weather station in order to provide ground conditions during GustAV's flight tests. This conditions measured

at the ground can be correlated with the data measured in flight during post processing. The weather station logs wind speed, wind direction, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, and temperature. The weather station consists of commercially available weather sensors and customized Arduino data logger setup to decode and record the parameters from each sensor. Data logger and the general setup of the weather station are shown in Fig. 2.31. Fig. 2.32 shows the weather station during one of the flight tests at TEMAC's field. This setup can provide useful real-time wind measurement for operational purposes. The weather data records were kept for every flight test for providing weather data at ground level for comparison with in-flight data captured in the air by GustAV.

The main component of the weather ground station is the DS6410 anemometer and wind vane manufactured by Davis Instruments. The cup anemometer can measure wind speed up to 89 m/s and the wind vane can measure the wind direction. They were both mounted 2 m off the ground on a metal tripod during the experiment at the flying field. This type of anemometer was selected because of its ease to use and reliability [49]. Bearings are used to ensure the wind cup shaft can rotate freely with minimal friction to reduce measurement error, especially under low wind speeds. At each rotation, the

rotor activates the reed switch and send an electrical pulse signal to the Arduino data logger. The speed, at which the cup rotor is rotating at is correlated to the wind speed. In the datasheet provided by Davis Instruments, that is included in Appendix 4. The anemometer readings were verified using the windtunnel at Ryerson University to wind speeds up to 20 m/s (Fig. 2.33) Although cup anemometers were used in previous gust measurement and produced fair results [50], wind-shear profile can cause unsteady motion of the cup rotor and produce measurements that oscilate, but are not related to atmospheric gusts [51]. In this experiment, the measurement using the cup anemometer was solely used to determine the mean-wind speed at ground level. The direction of the wind is measured with the wind vane. A 20 k  potentiometer is attached under the vane to measure its position. It acts as a voltage divider with 5 V supplied from the Arduino data logger. The analog signal of the wind vane position is then converted to bearing angle of the wind direction using the variable resistance of 0­20 k  with the half-way point (10 k ) aligns to the south. The zero angle position of the wind vane needs to be aligned to the magnetic north with the use of a compass at the flying field. The magnetic declination of the flying field is added (-10.1979°) to convert

The measurements are fetched by the Arduino data logger every second and being recorded to the SD card. The weather shield also contains two RJ11 connectors as an interface between the Arduino data logger and the Davis Instruments anemometer and wind vane.

The flying field consists of a paved runway and a flying zone over a farm field that measures approximately 300 meters by 400 meters. As part of the planning of the experiments, a digital elevation model was obtained from the government of Ontario and the terrain surrounding of the flying field was studied. The elevation of the runway is 243 meters above the sea level and the farm field has variation of no more than 5 meters in elevation as shown in Fig. 2.34.

Wind Tunnel and In-Flight Experiments
In order to develop GustAV and measure atmospheric data using the Aventech air-data system, ground and flight tests were required. For example, wind-tunnel tests were preformed in the wind tunnel of Ryerson University. Furthermore, flight tests were performed at the Toronto Electric Model Aviation Club (TEMAC) in Stouffville, Ontario. The objectives, significant events, and the results of the tests performed are categorized and discussed in this chapter.

3.1

Wind Tunnel Test

The goal of the wind tunnel experiment was to quantify the sensitivity of the pressure transducers and the response of the five-hole probe changes in angle of attack. The Ryerson's large wind-tunnel was used to conduct the tests and its configuration is shown in Fig. 3.1. The closed circuit wind-tunnel has a 91.4 cm by 91.4 cm square test section. The turning vanes, screens, and flow nacelle are installed in the tunnel to reduce the turbulence level and improved the flow quality. Previous experiment performed by Barcelos has shown the wind tunnel used in this experiment has a turbulence intensity slight less than 0.29% [54]. The low turbulence level is preferable to determine the sensitivity of the pressure transducers.

The five-hole probe was attached to the wing of GustAV and tested at freestream velocities of 10 m/s, 15 m/s, and 20 m/s. The tests were conducted at -2.5°, 2.5°, and 7.5°angles of attack. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 3.2. The halfspan of the wing was mounted through the floor of the turn table in the wind tunnel with the five-hole probe located near the center line of the test section. The data acquisition was acquired using the Aventech AIMMS-30 air-data system which is the same hardware 45

that is onboard GustAV. The data logging device recorded the angle of attack differential pressure (p3 - p1 ), the angle of sideslip differential pressure (p4 - p2 ), the dynamic pressure (p5 - p6 ), and the static pressure p6 . The numbering convention of the pressure ports on the five-hole probe is shown in Fig. 3.3. The pressure measurements were recorded at all three angle of attack settings at three different speeds of the freestream flow. At each setting, 2000 samples were recorded at 50 samples per second. The results are shown in Fig. 3.4. The goal is to gather pressure measurements at a constant airspeed in the wind tunnel and determine the standard deviations of the pressure measured by the sensors. This information is important since the signal noise of the pressure transducers determines the smallest perturbation of wind speed that can be detected by this air-data instrument setup. Based on these measurements, the smallest wind-speed perturbation that the five-hole probe can detect is 0.10 m/s.

The wind tunnel used in this experiment has a low turbulence intensity slight less than 0.29% [54]. The turbulence intensity can also be described as the root mean square (RMS) or the standard devation of the flow velocity. Hence, the lower turbulence intensity is the result of fewer fluctuations in the flow velocity measurements. When comparing the wind tunnel to environment within the earth's atmospheric boundary layer where the turbulence intensity can reach 30% or higher [11], the turbulence found in the wind tunnel is extremely low. Therefore, for the purpose of analyzing the noise level of the air-data system, it is fair to assume the speed of air flowing past the wind tunnel cross section is constant and fluctuations in pressure measured by the transducers are signal noise. The distribution of the signal noise at various freestream velocities and angles of attack are plotted with normal distribution fits in Fig.3.5. The root-mean-square values of the five-hole probe sample error are summerized in Table 3.1. The sensor performed similarly at airspeeds of 15 m/s and 20 m/s. The pressure transducers have a precision of 1 Pa which explains the relatively poorer performance at lower pressure values at 10 m/s (Fig. 3.5a). In conclusion, the gust measurement should be performed at airspeed faster than 15 m/s in order to take advantage of the better performance of the five-hole probe at the higher pressures.

UAV Platform

During the development of the GustAV platform, flight tests were performed to determine the performance and realibility of the vehicle. These tests include tuning the autopilot control system to achieve autonomous flight before the air-data system was mounted. The tables in Appendix 1 are showing the flight log of the flight vehicles, GustAV and Bix3, with the date and elapsed time of each flight. The maximum altitudes and speeds achieved during each flight are also included in the tables.

3.2.1

First Flight

On February 6, 2016, GustAV flew smoothly during its first flight. That flight was a short exploration of the flight characteristics of GustAV that lasted for 3 minutes. The aircraft had only its essential systems in order to reduce the complexity of the setup. The pilot performed the flight entirely in manual mode to retain full control and ensure safety before the autopilot system was fully tested in later flights. During the first flight a tail-mounted camera revealed excessive upward bending of the wing. In Fig. 3.6, two frames from the camera footage were superimposed to show the amount of wing bending under aerodynamic load. The original wing design of GustAV used a balsa wood for the internal structure and Monokote, a plastic shrink wrap film material, for the wing skin. This method produced a strong and light-weight design which can be found on most model aircraft. However, it appeared that the original wing design did not provide sufficient structural rigidity. Since the five-hole probe mounted on the wing tip is sensitive to the vertical motion of the probe relative to the inertial measurement unit mounted in the aircraft's fuselage.

Figure 3.6: Wing bending under aerodynamic load.

Figure 3.7: Balsa and fiberglass wing skin.

50

CHAPTER 3. WIND TUNNEL AND IN-FLIGHT EXPERIMENTS

3.2. UAV PLATFORM

The bending of the wing induces extra motion to the five-hole probe and causes sensor errors. Stiffer wing was required to mitigate this problem. Thus, the Monokote skin was replaced by thin balsa sheet reinforced with fiberglass to stiffen the wing structure as shown in Fig. 3.7. The extra rigidity reduced wing bending and enhanced the accuracy of the air-data system. It came, however, with the penalty of 1 kg of extra mass and reduced the aircraft's endurance but the action was nessesary to ensure the measurement accuracy of the experiment.

3.2.2

Aircraft Performance, Stability, and Control

Several modifications were made related to the aerodynamics of the aircraft. On the seventh flight, GustAV exhibited instabilities while rolling that caused the aircraft to yaw drastically then entered a stall. Fortunately, the pilot was able to recover from the stall and landed the aircraft safely. A snippet of the flight recording shows that large aileron deflections caused significant amounts of adverse yaw, especially during relatively slow flight at high angles of attack. The relatively large angles and angular rates would then lead to one wing entering stall as pointed out in Fig. 3.8 at the 581 seconds mark.

After the incident, differential ailerons were setup to reduce adverse yaw. Furthermore, the original tail design did not provide sufficient directional stability. Thus, additional area was added to the vertical tail in order to increase directional stability of the aircraft. The tail was replaced with a new design with vertical stabilizer 40% larger than the original (Fig. 3.9). Also, the elevator was undersized on the original tail design and did not provide sufficient pitching control authority at low speeds which resulted in hard landings. Therefore, in addition to a new vertical tail design, the elevator chord was increased in order to provide sufficient longitudinal control response of the aircraft at low speeds during approach and landing.

Autopilot System Tuning

In order for GustAV to operate according to the flight mission and follow the programmed trajectory accurately, the autopilot system needed to be tuned. This was performed by changing the PID controller parameters of the autopilot system until the desired level of control system performance is achieved. The tuning is crucial for the flight control system to achieve autonomous mission following. During the tuning process, the pilot commanded the aircraft to do a series of rapid consecutive rolling and pitching maneuvers. The onboard flight control system monitors the aircraft control surfaces actuation and the measured feedback of the aircraft dynamics. This process was repeated multiple times to allow the control system to gather sufficient flight data to perform the PID turning. At the end of this process, the demanded roll or pitch angle shown in the flight data log should closely match the achieved angle. This signifies the PID parameters are tuned to the correct values and the system is ready to perform autonomous flights. Fig. 3.10 shows the achieved roll and demanded roll measurement of a correctly tuned flight controller. The roll angle achieved by the aircraft had minimal lag and overshoot when compared to the demanded roll by the flight control system. 53

Gust Measurement
Air-Data System Integration

Once the aircraft was able to perform autonomous flights and follow programmed flight paths. The focus of the flight testing shifted onto the air-data system integration. These test performed during flights 18 to 21 (see flight logs in Appendix 1) and the flew the `racecourse' pattern around four waypoints (represented by diamond markers) shown in Fig. 3.11. These flights required the aircraft to fly straightand-level in two opposite directions and allow the air-data system to measure the wind coming from both directions of the aircraft. The aircraft also had to perform tight turns at the end of each straight segment where the GNSS receiver performance are tested since weaker signal strength is expected when the aircraft is banking and hence reduces the accuracy of the air-data system. Through out these flight tests, shielding was added to the main circuit board of the AIMMS-30 system and low bandwidth GNSS antennas were replaced with high bandwidth antennas to improve the performance of the air-data system. During flights 18 and 19, the GNSS receivers suffered from low signal strength. The air-data system was unable to obtain any positioning information during those flights. Aluminum foils were used to surround the GNSS receiver circuit boards to form a shield. The foil is grounded to the circuit board

The GNSS receiver performance is important for the gust measurements since the GNSS velocity solution is required for the correction of the inertial measurement unit. Furthermore, in order to measure the attitude of the aircraft using the differential carrier-phase, both GNSS receivers have to function at the same time. Although the signal performance was improved from previous flights using a better shielding, interruptions occurred while the aircraft was banking. Since the patch antennas on the wing 56

CHAPTER 3. WIND TUNNEL AND IN-FLIGHT EXPERIMENTS 3.3. GUST MEASUREMENT of GustAV work best with signals coming directly overhead, and become less sensitive towards the horizon [47], banking the aircraft weakens the GNSS signal. The weak signal performance can be seen in Fig. 3.12a where the number of GNSS satellites detected was dropped every time when the aircraft banked. Since the GNSS receiver required a signal from at least four satellites, the results collected from flight 20 did not provide a good solution for the aircraft's velocity. Fig. 3.12b shows a much improved GNSS signal reception during flight 23 with newly installed GNSS antennas. The new antenna, Tallyman TW1422 has a higher bandwidth and better off-zenith performance than the previously used antenna. GustAV performed an autonomous flight similar to flight 20 with rolling manuevers up to 50°and the GNSS satellite count never dropped below five during those manuevers.

Gust Measurement Experiment

Atmospheric gusts were measured during flights 22 and 23 (3 June 2017) at TEMAC's field. Both flights lasted for 15 minutes and GustAV performed the `racecourse' flight circuit at various altitudes (Fig. 3.13).

The aircraft first climbed to the altitude of 150 m above the flying field and begin the flight mission. The aircraft maintained the altitude until two circuits were completed before descending down by 25 m in order to perform a circuit at the lower altitude. This flight profile continues until the aircraft had reached the altitude of 50 m above the field and the pilot regained control of the aircraft and proceed 57

The Aventech AIMMS-30 air-data system recorded the 3-D wind field data during the flights and data were synchronized with the measurement on the ground by the weather station. The gust measuring experiment began when the aircraft had reached the required altitude and maintaining stable flight for a few minutes. This was done in order to ensure that the Kalman filter estimator and GNSS receivers had been given sufficient time to have come to a converged solutions and, thus, improved the accuracy. The measured wind speeds were consistent when flying in opposite directions during the `racecourse' patterns and Fig 3.14 shows the wind direction measured by the air-data system while the aircraft completes two laps of the `racecourse' pattern. The airborne wind data is also showing good agreement with the weather ground station measurement (Fig 3.14). These results provided a high degree of confidence that the air-data system was functioning properly during these flights. This portion of the data collected was processed and compared with the von K´ arm´ an turbulence model in Chapter 4.

Atmospheric wind was measured during flight 23 from timestamp 1250 s to timestamp 1750 s while GustAV performed the experiment at altitudes of 100 m, 75 m, and 50 m above ground level (AGL) at TEMAC field as the 3D flight profile is shown in Fig. 4.1.

According to literature and previous research discussed in Chapter 1, gust properties are governed by the altitude above the ground. Also, the mean wind speed varies at different altitudes. Therefore, the measurements from the flight 23 were separated into three segments where the aircraft maintained altitudes of 100 m, 75 m, and 50 m (Fig 4.2). The mean wind velocities at each altitude segments are 5.00 m/s, 3.72 m/s, and 3.21 m/s respectively. Summary of the data segments is included in Table 4.1.

The wind data measured by the air-data system at during the flight 23 are shown in Fig. 4.3 along with the wind at the ground level measured by the weather station as a comparison. The wind measurements were transformed into the mean wind coordinate systems shown in Fig. 1.2 and the mean wind is subtracted from the result to compute the longitudinal, lateral, and vertical gusts. The gusts measured at the three different altitudes are separated into three directions and presented in Fig. 4.4, Fig. 4.5, and Fig. 4.6. The gust data from flight 23 were converted into power spectral density (PSD) using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm in MATLAB [55, 56]. This provided the spectral results of the airborne gust data. The 3-D gust data, longitudinal, lateral, and vertical gust spectra, were separated into three altitudes and displayed in Fig. 4.7. The spectra were plotted in logarithmic scale and a -5/3 slope was included onto each plot. The result showed the spectra followed the -5/3 slope in the logarithmic scale at the high spatial frequencies () which matched the prediction provided by the von K´ arm´ an model as discussed in section 1.4.1. The knee of the power spatial density curve was observed at the spectral frequency of approximately 10-3 of each spectrum. This signifies the frequency range where the power special density tapers and remains constant. The position of the knee correlates to the altitude and the mean wind velocity of the location of interested. The measured spectra were compared to the von K´ arm´ an model using the turbulence intensities ( ) and turbulence scale length (L) as specified Military Handbook MIL-HDBK-1797 [30] (Eq. 1.14 to 1.17).

CHAPTER 4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF INFLIGHT WIND-SPEED MEASUREMENTS To obtain the turbulence intensities ( ) of the von K´ arm´ an turbulence model for comparison, Eq. 1.14 provided by the Military Handbook MIL-HDBK-1797 was used [30]. The equation requires an input of wind speed measured at the height of 20 feet (6 m). However, this measurement was not obtained during the flight experiment as there was no anemometer set up at that height. The wind speed at 20 feet was estimated by combining the wind measured by the air-data system at the flight altitude (50 m - 100 m) and the weather ground station (2 m) using the wind profile power law provided in literature [57]: zg1 zg2


U (zg1 ) = U (zg2 )

(4.1)

where  is an exponent depended upon the roughness of terrain and zg1 and zg2 denote the altitudes above ground. A list of roughness exponents can be found in the same literature [57] while in this case, it is found by fitting the power law to two known wind speeds at height of 2 m and 100 m. The exponent was calculated to be 0.44 and the wind speed power curve was plotted along with the wind speed measured at various altitudes in 4.8. Fig. 4.8 shows the resultant curve along with the instantaneous wind speed measured at various altitudes during flight 23 shown as scattered dots. The result predicted by the wind power law showed a close relationship with the measured wind speed from the altitude of 100 m all the way down to the ground surface. Using this method, the wind speed at the height of 20 feet (6 m) was calculated to be 1.46 m/s during the flight experiment. The turbulence intensities (u ,v ,w ) and scale length parameters (Lu ,Lv ,Lw ) for the von K´ arm´ an model were calculated using Eq. 1.14 to 1.17) and the results are listed in Table 4.2.

The predicted curves are shown as the magenta line over the experimental spectra measured by GustAV during flight 23 (Fig. 4.9, Fig. 4.10, and Fig. 4.11).

When compared against the von K´ arm´ an model, longitudinal and lateral gust spectra measured during the flight are shown matching mostly across the spatial frequencies between 10-3 to 10-1 rad/m with a slight shift to the right. This reflects a higher turbulence intensities were measured during the flight test, especially along the longitudinal direction. This suggests a less stable atmosphere was observed while the measurements were taken. Larger deviations from the model were observed in the vertical gust measurements as the power special density did not taper at frequency of 10-2 which is shown as the knee on the von K´ arm´ an model predictions using the parameters provided by the MIL-HDBK-1797 (Fig. 4.9c, 4.10c, and 4.11c).

Figure 4.12: Turbulence intensities and scale length parameters derived from gust measurements and the comparison against the von K´ arm´ an models from MIL-HDBK-1797.

Finally, the turbulence intensities values and scale length values calculated from the gust measurements were compared to the MIL-HDBK-1797 von K´ arm´ an model. With flight data only available from three altitudes on the same day, it was difficult to draw a distinctive conclusion. However, the comparison shows some promising results such as the turbulence intensities along the three directions (Fig 4.12a) within the atmospheric boundary layer followed the relationship of u > v > w suggested by Etkin [22]. The intensities derived from the flight results also follow a similar downward slope towards the higher altitudes. However, the flight data derived scale length values increased at a greater rate along the altitude scale `than the model predicted by the MIL-HDBK-1797. This is caused by a higher intensity gusts recorded by GustAV during the flight 23 than the literature model has predicted. Unfortunately, there are insufficient flight data to carry further analysis to determine whether the MIL-HDBK-1797 model differs from the gust intensities results measured during the flight. In summary, the MIL-HDBK-1797 von K´ arm´ an turbulence model provided a good agreement to the longitudinal and lateral gusts observed by GustAV during flight 23 but the vertical gusts had been 69

CHAPTER 4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF INFLIGHT WIND-SPEED MEASUREMENTS underpredicted as the resultant functions of the von K´ arm´ an model were shown below the measured gust spectra in all cases shown in Fig. 4.9 to Fig.4.11. From the data gathered from flight 23, the gust intensity results from the data fit suggests the aircraft encounters stronger gust during the flight than predicted by the model. The derived turbulence intensities (Fig 4.12a) confirm the anisotropic air properties in the low-altitude environment within the atmospheric boundary layer. This indicates that there are shortfalls of the MIL-HDBK-1797 by assuming equal intensity values between the longitudinal and lateral directions (Eq. 1.15). Measuring the mean wind velocity at 20 feet above the ground instead of using the power law interpolation and reduce possible error in the empirical methods from the Military Handbook MIL-HDBK-1797. Improvement to the existing model can be done by measuring the gust above the same area of different weather and wind conditions. Regression analysis of measurements taken under different conditions can produce more accurate solutions to turbulence intensities and scale length parameters for that specific surface terrain. Large-scale surveying of a variety of terrain features will produce a more generalized model to enhance or replace the existing MIL-HDBK-1797 von K´ arm´ an model.

Conclusion
A gust measuring unmanned aerial vehicle, GustAV, was built and tested in order to conduct airborne atmospheric wind surveying at low-altitudes. GustAV demonstrated its ability to perform autonomous flight missions and carry out the atmospheric experiments. The supporting systems including the ground control station and the weather ground station have been thoroughly tested as well. The cost-effective unmanned aerial system provided better flexibility when compared to a fixed base measurement platform for low-altitude atmospheric surveying. The airborne system is capable of measuring the gust profile above land and water, and challenging terrain where the option of setting up tall tower structure is not feasible. Through out the experiments, the gust measurements gathered between 50 m to 100 m above a farm field near Stouffville, Ontario were analyzed and compared with the von K´ arm´ an model provided in the MIL-HDBK-1797. This comparison was a preliminary attempt to validate the published turbulence model at low-altitudes for unmanned aerial vehicles research and development. Although more data is still required in order to construct a generalized gust model, the preliminary results have shown a potential shortfall of the von K´ arm´ an model at underpredicting the low-frequency vertical gusts at the altitudes under 100 m. The outcome is encouraging and suggests improvements that can be made to the existing gust models such as including anisotropic turbulence properties in different directions. The next step in this project is to perform tests over a longer period of time at various locations and under different mean wind conditions. In the current empirical model, only the altitude and the wind speed are used to correlate intensity and the scale length of the turbulence. The model can be improved by additional parameters such as terrain roughness and weather condition. These changes can produce 71

CHAPTER 5. CONCLUSION a more sophisticated empirical method for the von K´ arm´ an model to incorporate with seasonal and geographical influences. The new model will be able to improve the fidelity of the gust model for small UAV development in the future.

A Tallysman Accutenna® TW1421/TW1422 Compact Dual Feed Embedded GPS/GLONASS The TW1421/TW1422 employ Tallysman's unique Antenna Accutenna
®

technology covering the GPS L1, GLONASS G1, and SBAS (WAAS, EGNOS & MSAS) frequency band (1574 to 1606 MHz). It provides truly circular response over its entire bandwidth thereby producing superior multipath signal rejection. It also offers high out of band signal rejection. The antennas feature a novel 25mm wideband patch element with dual-feeds that are summed in a 90° Hybrid and input to a two stage Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) with a mid-section SAW a second low noise gain stage. This configuration provides excellent axial ratio and cross-polarization rejection across the full frequency band. The TW1422 has a pre-filter which increases the antenna's immunity to high amplitude interfering signals, such as LTE and other cellular signals. The built-in 35mm circular ground plane should ideally be augmented with a local system ground plane or reflecting surface (DC connection not required).

The height of the RF shield (can) will be selected based upon the connector type. Connectors which require RG174 cable will be used with the taller can. Connectors which require mico-coax cable will be used with the shorter can. OEM antennas are easily detuned by the local environment. Tallysman offers custom tuning services for optimized integration into OEM end-user modules.

Accessories

Includes  both wind speed and wind direction sensors. Rugged components  stand up to hurricaneforce winds, yet are  sensitive  to a light breeze.  Includes  sealed bearings  for long life. The range and accuracy specifications have been  verified  in windtunnel tests.   In areas where icing of the anemometer is a  problem, drip rings deflect water  from the  joint between moving parts.
