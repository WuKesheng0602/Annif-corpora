ABSTRACT Ahmed Minhas: Instagram, Influencers, and Native Advertising: Examining Follower Engagement with Influencer Content (Under the direction of Dr. Greg Levey)

This Master of Professional Communication Major Research Paper (MRP) aims to examine whether Instagram influencer engagement levels have been negatively impacted by the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) regulations requiring social media influencers, brands, and marketers, to visibly disclose their partnerships. The FTC's regulations were enacted within the context of native advertising, with concern that consumers were unable to distinguish between genuine influencer content and sponsored content. Due to this research paper's role as a pilot study, the literature review outlines the concepts of native advertising, micro-celebrities, the Instafamous, social media influencers, and electronic word of mouth (eWOM). A quantitative content analysis was conducted using 20 samples (each) from two Instagram influencers within the niches of travel and menswear. The result of this pilot study shows that the presence of sponsorship disclosure and overt product advertisement (including product placement) in influencer content has a negative impact on engagement.

INTRODUCTION

As one of the most popular social media networks globally (Statista, 2017c), and the fastest growing with one billion users (Constine, 2018), Instagram gives users the ability to share personal photos and videos (Djafarova & Rushworth, 2017) in a documentary type fashion. The smartphone app distinguishes itself from competitors by focusing on photo-sharing, a simple and consistent design, the ability to attract under-30 audiences (DeMers, 2017), and dedication to constantly improving its mobile functionality (Manjoo, 2017) for greater access. Instagram is visited by over 500 million daily active users (Balakrishnan & Boorstin, 2017), and attracts a wide range of people across various demographics, fostering the development of niche communities which in turn give rise to social media influencers. A social media influencer is an individual who utilizes social media to establish themselves as credible sources of information (Khamis, Ang, & Welling, 2017) by weaving compelling visual narratives into their content (De Veirman, Cauberghe, & Hudders, 2017). Social media platforms ­ such as Instagram ­ provide influencers considerable reach and exposure, thanks to the increasing base of users as smartphones become globally ubiquitous (Poushter, Bishop, & Chwe, 2018). A social media influencer's perceived social influence comes from their number of followers; a greater number of followers correlates to the greater

perceived social influence (Djafarova & Rushworth, 2017). By using this, social media influencers can disseminate information and persuade the purchasing behaviours of their followers by virtue of their authenticity and original content (Kapitan & Silvera, 2016). As consumers increasingly adopt smartphones and other mobile devices, they shift from traditional media sources to the web. This movement has pressured brands and marketers to adopt new strategies to advertise to an increasingly digital dependent audience, and one of these strategies is influencer marketing (Woods, 2016). Influencer marketing can provide a staggering 11 times return on investment in contrast to traditional advertising (Woods, 2016), resulting in brands quickly understanding the virality, impact, and influence social media influencers have on their followers. That being the case, brands regularly work with social media influencers to promote their products (De Veirman et al., 2017). Influencers can reach a very specific and targeted demographic of consumers in a short amount of time, and thanks to its low cost, influencer marketing has become a popular method for brands to advertise to and engage with consumers online (Evans, Phua, Lim, & Jun, 2017). In comparison to traditional methods of advertising, influencer advertisements are difficult for consumers to recognize. Combined with Instagram's design focus on visuals and its ability to incorporate native advertising into its feed (Manic, 2015), it is

2

INSTAGRAM, INFLUENCERS, AND NATIVE ADVERTISING: EXAMINING FOLLOWER ENGAGEMENT WITH INFLUENCER CONTENT

difficult to distinguish between an advertisement and authentic content (Woods, 2016). Native advertising is a non-intrusive form of advertising (Wojdynski & Golan, 2016) that emulates the appearance, format or design of the content and/or platform in which it is placed (Wang & Huang, 2017; Evans et al., 2017). This blurring between native advertisements and genuine content has forced the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to pass regulation requiring influencers and brands to disclose their relationships (Federal Trade Commission [FTC], 2017b). Has this requirement, in addition to Instagram's new disclosure feature (Ha, 2017), changed the way users engage with content? Does native advertising in an Instagram influencer's content play a role in how users engage with the content? Does the placement of sponsored products in images by influencers who promote an "authentic" lifestyle garner less engagement than images without a featured product? A lack of research has prompted this pilot study as it seeks to answer these questions as well as the following core question: Do Instagram users engage more with content that is subtle or overt in its branding, pitch, and advertising using the combination of visual narrative (image) and text (caption)?

LITERATURE REVIEW

The three literature review concepts selected for this study are due in part to their link to Instagram influencers, their virtual celebrity status, and ability to incorporate native advertising into their content. Research directly related to Instagram influencers and how users interact with their content with regard to the use of native advertising is still inadequate. Therefore, researching literature review concepts that address Instagram influencers and native advertising on social media proved to be an unsuccessful effort. In order to connect this study with already existing academic research, the following concepts were chosen: i.) native advertising, ii.) micro-celebrities & the Instafamous, and iii.) social media influencers and electronic word of mouth. Each concept provides significant academic background to this study and relates to the overall topic.

1. Native Advertising

The Internet has changed the nature of advertising as consumers turn away from traditional media; therefore, broadcasting a message to consumers in order to persuade them to have a more positive attitude toward a particular brand or to persuade them to make a product purchase is not as effective as it once was (Mangold & Faulds, 2009). Advertising on the Internet initially took the form of pop-up ads, banners, and other methods of advertisements on a web page, but this form eventually became outdated due to its intrusive nature (Manic, 2015). It was not an effective method of getting consumer attention, as consumers began to ignore this type of digital advertising by learning to be less receptive to advertising on the Internet (Chung, Kim, & Ahn, 2017). As brands and advertisers sought a new method, it gave rise to native advertising (Manic, 2015). This new method has caused the movement of promotional content from top, side, and bottom columns of content web pages to take place within the content itself (Manic, 2015). Native advertising is "defined as the practice by which a marketer borrows from the credibility of a content publisher by presenting paid content with a format and location that matches the publisher's original content" (Wojdynski & Golan, 2016, p. 1403). More broadly, native advertising takes the form of content that is presented on a web page or

5

INSTAGRAM, INFLUENCERS, AND NATIVE ADVERTISING: EXAMINING FOLLOWER ENGAGEMENT WITH INFLUENCER CONTENT

mobile app, wherein a user is unable to differentiate between content and advertisement (Wang & Huang, 2017; Evans et al., 2017). Such advertising can take a multitude of forms which range from sponsored and branded posts on social media platforms, including articles, images, and videos, as well as links on blogs and non-intrusive recommendations on websites and search engines (Wojdynski & Golan, 2016). The six major types of native advertising are: (1) in-feed units i.e. Facebook/Instagram (used with disclosure language), (2) paid search units i.e. search engines, (3) recommendation widgets i.e. ads at the end of an article, (4) promoted listings i.e. Amazon ads, (5) in-ad with native element units, and (6) custom elements that cannot be categorized into the previous types (Manic, 2015). This method of advertising is less intrusive (Wojdynski & Golan, 2016), and when placed in a website or social media feed, helps to promote advertiser and marketer goals of promoting brands, products, and services via ad exposure (Chung, Kim, & Ahn, 2017). Over time, consumers have developed ad skepticism in order to cope with advertising influence in their lives (Chung, Kim, & Ahn, 2017). Ad skepticism refers "to the general tendency toward disbelief of advertising claims and is an opposite concept of ad credibility" (Lee, Kim, & Ham, 2016, p. 1428). Consumers online are focused and are willing to make an effort to avoid ads (Chung, Kim, & Ahn, 2017). This can be explained by the persuasion knowledge model (PKM), which assumes that people create

6

INSTAGRAM, INFLUENCERS, AND NATIVE ADVERTISING: EXAMINING FOLLOWER ENGAGEMENT WITH INFLUENCER CONTENT

convictions regarding persuasion strategies, promoters/advertisers, and influence subjects to manage attempts of persuasion they encounter online (Lee et al., 2016). While native advertising may be seen as a better alternative to intrusive popup ads, some researchers are concerned with the lack of disclosure in regards to the fact that a native advertisement is still an advertisement, and consumers are unable to notice the difference (Taylor, 2017; Wojdynski & Golan, 2016). However, research shows that consumers respond positively to native ads because of their non-intrusive nature (Lee et al., 2016), and that has helped this form of advertising to grow as a primary revenue source for publishers. Interestingly, there is a correlation between user trust and acceptance of native advertisements, and time spent on social media (Wang & Huang, 2017). Much of the current research concerning native advertising focuses on ethical implications and the lack of clear disclosure, but does not evaluate the effectiveness of social media influencers who employ native advertising techniques, especially on Instagram. This research can assist brands, marketers, and social media influencers to have a better understanding of how users react to native advertisements, and whether they should continue using this form of advertising or adjust the method in which to reach consumers.

Section 1: Review

This section highlights native advertising by reviewing the research of various academics regarding what native advertising is, for what reason it exists and why it has proliferated today, where it can be found, and how consumers react to native advertising in contrast to traditional advertising methods. Native advertising rose to its current prominence due to consumers finding pop-up ads and banner ads of the early Internet days particularly intrusive to their online experience (Manic, 2015). The use of native advertising offers brands, marketers, and advertisers the ability to create an advertisement that consumers do not find intrusive. Advertisements that adopt the format, design or content of the platform in which they are placed are better received by consumers and can be categorically defined as native advertising (Wang & Huang, 2017; Evans et al., 2017). The following section will address the concepts of micro-celebrities, who are non-traditional celebrities that have gained fame online, and the Instafamous, a form of micro-celebrity that exists on the social media platform, Instagram. Micro-celebrities can be seen as precursors to social media influencers, who command influence on specific social media platforms by use of their fame and follower count.

2. Micro-celebrities & the Instafamous

In order to better understand social media influencers and their emergence, attention must be turned to micro-celebrities. The term micro-celebrity was first coined by Theresa M. Senft in 2001, in her study of camgirls and their use of then-new digital technologies to create an online performance (Khamis et al., 2017). Micro-celebrities are non-traditional celebrities who have gained fame or notoriety online (Djafarova & Rushworth, 2017) and researchers define them as "a mind-set and a collection of self-presentation practices endemic in social media, in which users strategically formulate a profile, reach out to followers, and reveal personal information to increase attention and thus improve their online status." (Marwick, 2015b, p. 138). Unlike traditional celebrities who develop within film and media, micro-celebrities can develop within various digital niches and platforms such as food bloggers, YouTube makeup artists, Vine comedians, Twitter users, etc. (Marwick, 2015b) and can be considered precursors to social media influencers due to perceived social influence by way of a large follower base (Djafarova & Trofimenko, 2018). Micro-celebrities use the techniques of self-branding or personal branding, by use of which they develop a distinct public image (Khamis et al., 2017), which, along with self-presentation (controlling the presentation and perception of oneself in a social setting) (Djafarova & Trofimenko, 2018), is critical to formulating a personality on social media that

9

INSTAGRAM, INFLUENCERS, AND NATIVE ADVERTISING: EXAMINING FOLLOWER ENGAGEMENT WITH INFLUENCER CONTENT

attracts followers. Just as brands have unique selling points and have a public identity, so do micro-celebrities (Khamis et al., 2017). Khamis et al. (2017) contend that there are three main reasons why selfbranding has taken root: (1) social media promises fame and possibly wealth to ordinary people who become micro-celebrities, (2) within the political culture of neoliberal individualism, the promise of a reward (fame, wealth) encourages selfbranding, and (3) the possibility of commercial branding available to social media influencers which develops from micro-celebrity practices is seen as inspirational and aspirational (anyone can become famous and thus, be successful). The attention economy has also given micro-celebrities the ability to create lasting and evolving relationships with their followers, in an environment where dispersed and privatized audiences can thrive (Khamis et al., 2017). The aspirational aspect of micro-celebrities has in turn given rise to `Instafamous' personalities (Djafarova & Rushworth, 2017). Instafamous or Instafame, is a type of micro-celebrity (and status) that exists specifically on Instagram, with the condition of having a large number of engaged followers (Marwick, 2015a). A participant in Djafarova and Rushworth's (2017) study described Instamous people as those with a strong online presence who have the wealth to make expensive purchases and share them on Instagram. The Instafamous also tend to be attractive and likeable (Kapitan & Silvera, 2016), have employment in unique and interesting industries such as travel, luxury and

10

INSTAGRAM, INFLUENCERS, AND NATIVE ADVERTISING: EXAMINING FOLLOWER ENGAGEMENT WITH INFLUENCER CONTENT

modeling, and generally emulate the lifestyles of celebrity culture (Marwick, 2015a). Micro-celebrities are an early form of social media influencers, and just as in the case of celebrities, their followers adopt the attributes, mannerisms, fashion, lifestyles, and product preferences in an attempt to be like them (Kapitan & Silvera, 2016). Micro-celebrities are highly influential thanks to the extensive reach provided by social media (Korotina & Jargalsaikhan, 2016). These digital celebrities make use of self-branding techniques to develop a distinct public image (Khamis et al., 2017), which gives them the ability to improve their status and command influence in various niches and platforms (Marwick, 2015b). They also work to develop their own brand thanks to their popularity and following online, and this popularity attracts the attention of major brands (Korotina & Jargalsaikhan, 2016). As followers are exposed to the content posted by micro-celebrities, they begin to emulate the mannerisms, lifestyles, and product preferences of the digital celebrity (Kapitan & Silvera, 2016). These followers trust micro-celebrities by accepting their advice and product recommendations on the assumption they are unbiased and have tried other products that have previously failed them (Korotina & Jargalsaikhan, 2016). However, these recommendations come with giveaways or discount codes, ensuring there is a direct link between a follower's expense and the micro celebrity's influence (Korotina & Jargalsaikhan, 2016). The possibility of wealth,

11

INSTAGRAM, INFLUENCERS, AND NATIVE ADVERTISING: EXAMINING FOLLOWER ENGAGEMENT WITH INFLUENCER CONTENT

fame and commercial branding opportunities (Khamis et al., 2017) gives microcelebrities the ability to become a social media influencer by promoting products of major brands, employing techniques of product placement, and profiting from sponsorship. As social media becomes a profitable engine for marketers and brands, it is important at this moment to evaluate the link between follower engagement (whether positive or negative) with a micro-celebrity's overt or subtle advertisement of products and product placement. This pilot study aims to contribute an answer and close the research gap.

Section 2: Review

The second section of this literature review focuses on the concepts of micro-celebrities and the Instafamous, both of which are non-traditional celebrities who have gained fame or notoriety online. Micro-celebrities can develop on a multitude of different social media platforms such as YouTube and Twitter, and thanks to an increasing user base, they can become digital celebrities in a variety of niches. These niches can consist of makeup artistry, electronic gadget reviewers, food bloggers and mommy bloggers, and more. Their perceived expertise in these niches is trusted by their followers. The Instafamous are a form of micro-celebrity that exist solely on Instagram. The intimate access the Instafamous provide Instagram users of their personal lives helps boost their popularity, and once they are able to monetize this popularity by partnering with brands and marketers, they can be recognized as social media influencers. The following section will review the literature on the topic of social media influencers, their prominence, and their ability to employ the use of electronic word of mouth.

3. Social Media Influencers & eWOM

As new social media networks emerge and existing social media platforms grow, it has forced advertisers to turn their attention to this digital medium and adapt ­ in order to reach consumers as they break away from traditional advertising (Woods, 2016). Social media networks are increasingly consumer-led wherein consumers generate their own content, and are also exposed to over 3,000 messages each day (Kapitan & Silvera, 2016). The number of people using social media networks rose to 2.22 billion in 2016, and this number is expected to rise (Jaakonmäki, Müller, & vom Brocke, 2017). In 2015, in the U.S. alone, 65% of all adults actively used social media platforms and 90% of Millennials aged 18-29 were active on social media (Woods, 2016). Not only is the number of active users on social media rising each year, but the time spent on social media is also rising (Woods, 2016). Consumers are also increasingly relying on social media to influence their purchasing decisions (Woods, 2016). It is seen by consumers as a more trustworthy source to find unbiased reviews and information about products and services, in contrast to corporate advertising in traditional media (Mangold & Faulds, 2009). Because the Internet is increasingly consumer-led, it has allowed consumers to network with people who have interests similar to their own (Mangold & Faulds, 2009), ultimately, this has given rise to online micro-

14

INSTAGRAM, INFLUENCERS, AND NATIVE ADVERTISING: EXAMINING FOLLOWER ENGAGEMENT WITH INFLUENCER CONTENT

celebrities and `Instafamous' personalities on social media (Djafarova & Rushworth, 2017), who are better defined as social media influencers. Influencers may also refer to people who are seen as opinion leaders, such as bloggers (Uzunolu & Misci Kip, 2014). Social media influencers are content creators and "referred to as people who have built a sizeable social network of people following them" (De Veirman et al., 2017, p. 798). They are also seen as authority figures and experts in one or multiple niches (De Veirman et al., 2017) such as travel, electronics, makeup, cars, etc. The greater the number of followers a social media influencer has, the greater the perceived social influence online (Djafarova & Rushworth, 2017). These influencers are able to mediate messages and influence consumers and communities (such as the niches mentioned earlier) in a digital environment where messages can be dispersed quickly and effortlessly with the potential for virality (Uzunolu & Misci Kip, 2014). Influencers are able to "influence the attitudes, decisions and behaviours of their audience of followers" (De Veirman et al., 2017, p. 801). The abandonment of traditional media and in turn, traditional advertising, has forced brands to adjust their advertising efforts and focus on social media influencers to endorse their products online (De Veirman et al., 2017). It is thanks to Instagram that the term `social media influencer' is easily recognized, thanks to the power of its visual narrative and over 600 million active monthly users

15

INSTAGRAM, INFLUENCERS, AND NATIVE ADVERTISING: EXAMINING FOLLOWER ENGAGEMENT WITH INFLUENCER CONTENT

(Virtanen, Björk, & Sjöström, 2017). Visual content is a preferred method of communication on social media as "our brains can consume, process and understand more information faster through images than through text" (Virtanen et al., 2017, p. 471). Because social media influencers inhibit the power of electronic word of mouth and have access to a large number of targeted users, influencer marketing is a powerful driving force online (Evans et al., 2017). Influencer marketing is a method in which brands identify and collaborate with influential social media users to endorse the brand or specific products through the use of their social media activities, in exchange for payment or free products (De Veirman et al., 2017). Electronic word of mouth or eWOM, is defined as "any positive or negative statement made by potential, actual, or former customers about a product or company, which is made available to a multitude of people and institutions via the Internet" (De Veirman et al., 2017, p. 801; Evans et al., 2017, p. 138). On Instagram, eWOM has become a persuasive driving force of influential information thanks to the rising popularity of this social media platform, due in part to greater accessibility to smartphones and other mobile devices (Djafarova & Rushworth, 2017). Brands have understood the power and reach of social media influencers, and how they are able to seamlessly integrate paid endorsements into their posts on Instagram (De Veirman et al., 2017). EWOM marketing has become an integral

16

INSTAGRAM, INFLUENCERS, AND NATIVE ADVERTISING: EXAMINING FOLLOWER ENGAGEMENT WITH INFLUENCER CONTENT

part of social media and viral marketing techniques (Hensel & Deis, 2010). The experience of brands pairing themselves with celebrity endorsers has carried over to social media, ensuring that they make strategic alliances with influencers who are considered for both authenticity and/or expertise by their followers (Kapitan & Silvera, 2016). It is imperative for a brand and influencer to ensure that they match based on criteria such as tone of voice, content (and type), reliability (or authenticity), and popularity (Uzunolu & Misci Kip, 2014). In the past, consumers used to rely on recommendations of friends or family before making a product purchase (Hensel & Deis, 2010). This has changed. A joint study conducted by Twitter and analytics firm Annalect found that 49% of people surveyed reported relying on recommendations made by influencers (Woods, 2016). A separate study "found that influencer marketing has the ability to trigger 11 times more return on investment than other forms of traditional advertising" (Woods, 2016, p. 7). It is then no wonder that advertisers are increasing their spending on social media every year, growing by 33.5% from $17.74 billion in 2014 to $23.68 billion in 2015 (Woods, 2016). It is forecasted that in 2018, Instagram's advertising revenue will grow to $6.84 billion (Statista, 2018a). Influencer advertising is both profitable and is less expensive than traditional advertising (Evans et al., 2017). While brands understand the benefits of employing social media influencers

17

INSTAGRAM, INFLUENCERS, AND NATIVE ADVERTISING: EXAMINING FOLLOWER ENGAGEMENT WITH INFLUENCER CONTENT

(De Veirman et al., 2017; Woods, 2016), they may not realize the negative impact overt sponsorship could have on an individual's perception of a brand. What is the reason for certain Instagram influencers and sponsored content receiving higher levels of engagement than others? For this study, the placement and use of sponsorship disclosure, use of product placement, and the way in which native advertisements are crafted into influencer content are possible reasons for differing levels of engagement. This will be evaluated in the analysis portion of this study. Understanding this is important for brands and marketers, but the research is also beneficial for academics to interpret user preferences and the way in which they engage with influencer content on Instagram.

Research Question 1: Do Instagram users prefer sponsored content that is overt in its advertising or do users prefer content that is subtle in its advertising (by employing native advertising) in an influencer's feed?

The literature review briefly examines native advertising and social media influencers but does not specifically look into native advertising used in an influencer's Instagram posts. The level of engagement with overtly branded posts may have an effect on consumer purchase behaviour, and this is important to understand if consumer aversion to advertisements is as clear on Instagram as it is in traditional media. This research question differs from RQ2 and RQ3 as the results of this question will provide an overall look into the engagement levels of influencer content on Instagram.

Research Question 2: Does the use of advertisement disclosure in an influencer's content have an effect on the level of engagement an influencer's Instagram post receives in contrast to a post that does not contain any disclosure?

The Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) requirement to disclose paid partnerships is fairly recent, and there is a lack of research conducted to

19

INSTAGRAM, INFLUENCERS, AND NATIVE ADVERTISING: EXAMINING FOLLOWER ENGAGEMENT WITH INFLUENCER CONTENT

investigate if the placement of disclosure has any effect on user engagement. This also relates to the transparency o f an influencer's sponsorship. An influencer may choose to avoid using clear sponsorship disclosure, as it could detract from their ability to incorporate native advertising into their visual and textual narrative. Current research shows that very obvious and clear disclosure of post sponsorship does cause users to think more critically about the content they are engaging with, and may even develop a negative attitude toward the content, brand or influencer (Evans et al., 2017; Taylor, 2017; Wojdynski & Golan, 2016). Therefore, content with clear sponsorship disclosure may garner lower levels of engagement, providing an insight into user behaviour on Instagram and whether users prefer genuine, advertisement free content or are satisfied with sponsored influencer content.

Research Question 3: Does the placement of a sponsored material product or its use in an influencer's Instagram post change the dynamic of engagement? RQ3a: The placement of a product in the foreground of the image vs. the background. RQ3b: If a product is used by the influencer vs. if the product not used.

There is little research regarding Instagram and product placement in influencer content. However, in relation to RQ2, overt or subtle product

20

INSTAGRAM, INFLUENCERS, AND NATIVE ADVERTISING: EXAMINING FOLLOWER ENGAGEMENT WITH INFLUENCER CONTENT

placement may have an effect on the level of engagement an influencer's content receives. Product placement can take can take many forms, but this study will focus on a.) product placement in the foreground of an image vs. the background, and b.) whether the influencer (or an individual(s) in the image) uses the product vs. the product is placed nearby but is not used.

METHODOLOGY: DATA COLLECTION & ANALYSIS

Instagram is a social media platform that employs visual storytelling. It allows individuals the ability to control how they present themselves to a wide audience by carefully crafting a visual rhetoric suited to their brand (Dingwall, 2017). Therefore, the data collected for this study will consist of a collection of images from Instagram. For further analysis, the images collected will extend beyond the image itself. The screenshots taken of each image will also include the caption section, in which an influencer may or may not have written a comment in addition to the picture (providing context for the viewer), along with any hashtags used or brands mentioned. For this study, the caption recorded will only consist of what is available to the viewer while scrolling through the Instagram feed, without needing to press "more" to view the entirety of written text in a post's caption. The images collected will also include any advertisement disclosure placed above the image, in the image, and/or in the caption. Instagram is designed to share photos and videos from a smartphone (Moreau, 2018), but it can also be accessed through a web browser on an Internet-connected computer. For the data collection approach, images will be taken manually from a web browser that is able to access Instagram. This study acts as pilot project and in order to answer the three aforementioned research questions, a quantitative approach will be used as the

22

INSTAGRAM, INFLUENCERS, AND NATIVE ADVERTISING: EXAMINING FOLLOWER ENGAGEMENT WITH INFLUENCER CONTENT

method of analysis. This quantitative approach helps narrow down two Instagram influencers within two separate niches. To ensure a narrow focus for this study and to prevent deviations, both influencers will be of the same gender and have between two million and three million followers. They will also be Englishspeaking, target a western market, and will either be a one-man team (their Instagram feed is wholly created, maintained, and managed by themselves) or give the impression of one. A clear difference between the two influencers will be the niche they target. One influencer must be within a niche not typically associated with the promotion of material items (e.g. photographers, backpackers, life-long travelers) and the other must be one who visibly promotes material items (e.g. lifestyle or fashion bloggers, gamers, product reviewers). For purposes of maintaining consistency, the two influencers must have an engagement rate between 3-6%. The engagement rate will be calculated using the following formula: average number of likes in posts 4-10 > divided by total number of influencer's followers > multiplied by 100% (Morales, 2017). This method of calculating an influencer's engagement rate is applied thanks to the detailed justification and in-depth explanation provided by Morales (2017) ­ an influencer marketing consultant. A sentiment analysis will not be used in this study and no contact will be made with an influencer, their posts or their followers. All data will be visually observed. The time frame of data collection will extend up to a maximum of six

23

INSTAGRAM, INFLUENCERS, AND NATIVE ADVERTISING: EXAMINING FOLLOWER ENGAGEMENT WITH INFLUENCER CONTENT

months to gather 20 relevant posts from each influencer, with the aim of collecting 10 posts with clear disclosure of sponsorship, and 10 posts that are subtle in sponsorship. It is commonly known that influencers on Instagram post new content each day, however, the frequency of paid content can be sporadic. Therefore, any influencer content that is not visually observed to promote a product will not be considered for this study in order to prevent a build-up of irrelevant data. Previous research on this topic within the English language is scarce and so it must be emphasized that the research and results of this study be considered part of a pilot project. From the images collected (raw data), the caption of each post will be recorded along with any hashtags and tags used in the image (ex. a brand or user tagged in the image itself). To answer RQ1, the engagement rate for each image will be calculated ­ which is the result of likes and comments divided by total follower count and subsequently multiplied by 100% (Thomas, 2017). This measure of engagement rate is for individual posts, rather than the engagement rate that is specific to an Instagram account (Morales, 2017). It is also the most widely accepted and common method of calculating the engagement level of individual Instagram posts. By knowing the engagement rate of each post, the data can then be organized according to how overt or subtle the branding/sponsorship is in each post is. By gathering this data, and in the hopes

24

INSTAGRAM, INFLUENCERS, AND NATIVE ADVERTISING: EXAMINING FOLLOWER ENGAGEMENT WITH INFLUENCER CONTENT

that the engagement rates between posts of each influencer differ significantly, an answer for RQ1 should come to light. To answer RQ2, influencer Instagram content will be separated into two sections: those that contain FTC-compliant sponsorship disclosure (#Ad; #Sponsored) that is clear and easy for a user to read (Chacon, 2017), and those that do not contain any sponsorship disclosure. The calculation to determine the engagement rate of each post (Thomas, 2017) will be applied to all of the content gathered. The final result should be able to ascertain whether Instagram users are affected by disclosure ­ and whether the presence of disclosure affects how users engage with influencer content. Understanding product placement and its effect on engagement is also an important part of this study. To answer RQ3, the data collected from each influencer using a quantitative approach will be organized according to the location of product placement (foreground/background), and if it is (or is not) being used by the influencer or another individual(s) in the image. The same engagement calculation (Thomas, 2017) will be applied to each image to determine the engagement rate. For this study, the engagement rate demonstrates whether or not product placement has an effect on user engagement with influencer content.

Research Analysis

The two influencers chosen for this study according to the methodology outlined above are @doyoutravel and @iamgalla. @doyoutravel is created and managed by Jack Morris, a backpacker turned life-long traveler and adventurer. Morris' travel photography has gained a following of 2.8 million followers (as of June 2018) and consistently receives a high level of engagement on each Instagram post. @iamgalla is created and managed by Adam Gallagher, founder of the popular menswear blog titled "I Am Galla," and has an Instagram following of 2.1 million followers (as of June 2018). However, while Gallagher is supported by a dedicated team for photography and editing, his Instagram page gives the impression of a one-man team. Gallagher's feed primarily features himself in a varying array of locations, as well as everyday pictures with his friends. Communication with followers is maintained by himself. To establish whether @doyoutravel and @iamgalla are acceptable influencers for this study, Morales' (2017) engagement calculation is used to determine their engagement rate. The calculated engagement rate of each influencer is displayed below in Table 1.

Once each influencer's engagement rate is calculated and is between 3 6%, 20 Instagram posts were chosen in reverse chronological order from a visually observed common starting point (see DYT1 (see Appendix A) and IAG1 (see Appendix B)) from each influencer's page. These posts were chosen over a time frame of six consecutive months, excluding any content that did not refer to

27

INSTAGRAM, INFLUENCERS, AND NATIVE ADVERTISING: EXAMINING FOLLOWER ENGAGEMENT WITH INFLUENCER CONTENT

brand sponsorship or feature a product or service in the images. To answer all three research questions, the engagement rate of posts DYT1-20 (see Appendix A) and IAG1-20 (see Appendix B) must first be calculated according to the commonly accepted method as outlined in Thomas' (2017) article. The result of the method is a percentage outlined in Table 3 below. In order to accomplish this, raw data which included the total number of likes and comments for each influencer's post was recorded (see Table 2).

In order to be able to answer RQ1, the influencer content collected was further organized according to the subtlety or overtness of brand sponsorship. The subtlety or overtness of brand sponsorship was visually observed. If an influencer's content used the built-in sponsorship disclosure feature of Instagram or disclosed sponsorship through the use of a FTC-compliant hashtag such as #Ad or #Sponsored (Chacon, 2017), had only the product in the image or if the product was the focus of the image, this was considered as overt brand sponsorship. If these criteria were not visually observed, then the content was considered to have subtle brand sponsorship. Refer to Table 4 (below) for the result. Once the content is found to be overt or subtle in its branding, the average of the two types of posts are calculated in Table 5 using the engagement rate percentages calculated in Table 3.

Visual observation of the content for the presence of sponsorship disclosure was conducted by looking for disclosure through i.) the use of Instagram's built-in disclosure feature (at the top of a post), ii.) a caption written by the influencer that discloses sponsorship, and iii.) the use of a FTC-compliant hashtag such as #Ad or #Sponsored (Chacon, 2017). See Table 6 for the results of this visual analysis. Once the content was organized according to the presence of clear disclosure or lack-of, the average of the two types of posts are calculated in Table 7 using the engagement rate percentages gathered in Table 3.

RESULTS

The engagement rate of Morris' @doyoutravel and Gallagher's @iamgalla Instagram pages had a percentage difference of 44.82% between them, which shows the followers of each influencer engage differently with their respective content. Regarding RQ1, the findings show that @doyoutravel had a significant percentage difference of 31.51% between content that was visually observed to be subtle in advertising and content that was observed to be overt in advertising, with subtle content receiving higher engagement. In contrast, @iamgalla had a much lower difference in engagement between the two types of posts - half that of the percentage difference observed in @doyoutravel's content. Between content that was visually observed to be subtle in advertising and content that was observed to be overt in advertising, the percentage difference was 14.84%. Subtle content received a higher average percentage of engagement than overt content. It is possible that @doyoutravel's followers expect Morris to be an authentic individual who simply wishes to share his travels and experiences, rather than to promote brand products and services that are not relevant to them. Followers may be turned off by promotional content and refuse to engage with it or ignore it completely. @iamgalla followers engaged less with content that is overt in its advertising ­ but not significantly ­ and this may be because Gallagher

40

INSTAGRAM, INFLUENCERS, AND NATIVE ADVERTISING: EXAMINING FOLLOWER ENGAGEMENT WITH INFLUENCER CONTENT

is known to be a menswear influencer who regularly partners with brands (as shown in his content), therefore he is expected to promote certain products. The findings of RQ2 show a similar result as the preceding research question. According to the guidelines outlined in the methodology section, the 20 posts chosen from each influencer for this study were visually observed to be subtle or overt in advertising if they did or did not contain sponsorship disclosure. For both @doyoutravel and @iamgalla, content that did not contain any sponsorship disclosure received 31.51% and 14.84% higher engagement than content that contained disclosure, respectively. Audience ad skepticism (Chung, Kim, & Ahn, 2017) may be activated when presented with clear advertisement disclosure, and users may make a conscious effort to avoid engaging with sponsored influencer content as they think more critically about it (Evans et al., 2017; Taylor, 2017). In addition, posts containing advertising disclosure receiving a lower level of engagement may be explained by the persuasion knowledge model (Lee et al., 2016). As soon as users become aware of a persuasion attempt, due to an incongruent product placement or the use of borrowed interest tactics, for example, the effectiveness of the persuasion attempt may lead to a user ignoring the content and not engaging with it. The result of RQ3a shows that if a product is not used within the content of the @doyoutravel Instagram page (or is not present within the image at all), it receives a higher amount of engagement as compared to when the product is used

41

INSTAGRAM, INFLUENCERS, AND NATIVE ADVERTISING: EXAMINING FOLLOWER ENGAGEMENT WITH INFLUENCER CONTENT

by the influencer, by a percentage difference of 25.06%. In contrast, if a product is used within the content of the @iamgalla page, the average engagement received is significantly higher, by a percentage difference of 45.35%, than if the product is not used or is simply on display. With regard to RQ3b, the results are starkly different from that of previous research questions. The @doyoutravel page's percentage difference between product placement in the foreground vs. the background was only 4.55%, with the latter receiving higher engagement. It is important to note that of the 20 images selected from the @doyoutravel page, 13 did not have the product or service present within the image. On the other hand, all the content chosen from the @iamgalla page for this study featured products placed in the foreground of the image. None of the images selected from this study had products placed within the background ­ showing Gallagher's possible purposeful intent of clear product placement.

DISCUSSION

The results of this pilot study show that Instagram influencers can derive a higher level of engagement with their followers when content is subtle in its advertising and brand sponsorship. The most significant result is shown by Morris' @doyoutravel Instagram page. Content that was visually perceived to be subtle in its branding, pitch, and advertising received higher engagement with a percentage difference of 31.51% against content visually perceived to be overt. Similarly, content that did not contain any sponsorship disclosure received a greater amount of engagement in contrast to content that contained FTCcompliant disclosure. In content where Morris was not pictured using a product, the engagement was also higher, with a percentage difference of 25.06%. Much of the content analyzed for this study did not feature the mentioned product or service within the image, which made it difficult to assess whether content in the foreground vs. the background of the image receives higher engagement. In this case, products placed within the background of the image or not pictured within the image received 4.55% higher engagement. Gallagher's @iamgalla Instagram account follows a similar pattern. Content visually perceived to be subtle in sponsorship received higher engagement than content that was visually perceived to be overt, with a percentage difference of 14.84%. This is the same percentage difference with

43

INSTAGRAM, INFLUENCERS, AND NATIVE ADVERTISING: EXAMINING FOLLOWER ENGAGEMENT WITH INFLUENCER CONTENT

regard to whether an image does or does not contain sponsorship disclosure, showing that users may elicit increased ad skepticism when presented with disclosure language (Wojdynski & Evans, 2016), resulting in lower engagement when disclosure is present. With difference to Morris' content, Gallagher's engagement is higher in content where he is pictured using a sponsored product, with a percentage difference of 45.35%. However, in consideration of this result, in each of the 20 images collected, the product was visible. This is in contrast to Morris' content where only seven images had a visible product. The difference in engagement may be explained by Morris' followers wanting authentic content i.e. beautiful pictures without significant product placement, whereas Gallagher's followers prefer to see the advertised product being used by him. Lastly, with regard to product placement within the foreground or background of Gallagher's content, the study falls short. None of the @iamgalla content analyzed for this study featured products within the foreground of the image ­ resulting in a null result. The majority of Gallagher's content on his Instagram page features products visible only in the foreground. For future studies evaluating how effective native advertising is in an Instagram influencer's content, it may be worth expanding the data set to gather a greater amount of raw data. It is the author's opinion that replicating this study using micro-influencers ­ those who have a significantly smaller and localized following of between 10,000-100,000 followers ­ may provide a more accurate

44

INSTAGRAM, INFLUENCERS, AND NATIVE ADVERTISING: EXAMINING FOLLOWER ENGAGEMENT WITH INFLUENCER CONTENT

engagement result regarding the use of native advertising within an influencer's content. This study used mega-influencers (more than 1-2 million followers) who command a following that is international and thus, may not have any interest in the product placement or advertising but instead are only interested in the influencer's story and/or images. Mega-influencers may also commonly become victim to bots who create false engagement with an influencer's followers in an attempt to poach their followers ("Follow Liker," n.d.), and can skew engagement results; more on this in the limitations section below.

LIMITATIONS

This study has considerable limitations. These limitations range from influencer demographic, gender, photography and/or editing style to the issue of fake followers. Increasing reports and interviews with influencers have shown Instagram influencers buying followers, likes, and comments to artificially boost follower count and/or engagement rates (Moses, 2017). Therefore, the engagement rates calculated in this study may not be entirely accurate. It is entirely possible that with over two million followers each, @doyoutravel and @iamgalla may be artificially increasing their numbers, however, this is unsubstantiated. There exist methods (and tools, ex. SocialBlade) in deducing whether an influencer's followers and engagement are genuine, by observing comments, studying follower growth, and evaluating engagement rates (Hughes, 2018), but these methods not always straightforward and accurate. One of the biggest issues plaguing Instagram is the use of automation tools ­ or bots ­ and this is another limitation of this study that must be considered. Influencers and "wannabe" influencers are employing the use of script -based programs to automatically like, follow, and comment on profiles of other Instagram users in an attempt to woo them into following their own profiles (Chen, 2017). Instagress was one popular Instagram automation tool before being forcibly shut down by Instagram in 2017 (Tiffany, 2017), but others have taken its

place including Follow Liker, Instazood, Gramista and many more. One of the processes in which Instagram bots automate human-like actions to increase exposure and follower count is by using the follow-unfollow method, in which a user follows as many profiles as possible, and then unfollows them a short time later (Koivu, 2018). Another process is by liking and commenting on content posted by other users (Ezanga, 2018), many times consisting of one-word comments, irrelevant compliments, questions or emojis. Bots are not genuine users and are able to artificially inflate the engagement an Instagram post receives. However, removing comments from being evaluated in the calculations of this study proves to be an impractical task, as @doyoutravel and @iamgalla can receive hundreds and even thousands of comments on each post. With regard to likes, evaluating the authenticity of each one is an impossible task.

FURTHER RESEARCH SUGGESTIONS

The method of analysis used in this study is strictly quantitative. This quantitative approach is meant to provide a theoretical and practical look at how users engage with native advertising and influencer content on Instagram. Using a qualitative approach by reviewing comments on influencer content and conducting an interview or survey with random users and their reasons for following and/or engaging with an influencer may provide a greater insight into a how users engage with influencer content and whether they recognize native advertising on Instagram. Further research may also be conducted on female influencers such as mommy bloggers and fitness influencers, influencers from the LGBTQ+ community, as well as influencers of visible minority backgrounds. The content, style, and partner brands may differ for each of these community members. Finally, replicating this study by using micro-influencers may yield an entirely different result, with possibly higher engagement rates; this is discussed at greater length in the discussion section (above).

CONCLUSION

This pilot study evaluates how Instagram users engage with influencers they follow and the effectiveness of native advertising techniques employed by influencers in their content. Native advertising as a non-intrusive form of advertising is highly effective, with 32% of consumers willing to share a native advertisement with their peers, nearly double that of traditional banner advertisements (Nwazor, 2017). The expenditure on native advertising has doubled between 2015 and 2018 in both developed and developing nations including Australia, Canada, China, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States (Statista, 2018b). Growth in native advertising is expected to continue; by 2020 in Western Europe, native advertising may represent up to 52% of all digital display advertising (Harms, Bijmolt, & Hoekstra, 2017). While research concerning social media influencers and how users engage with their content is inadequate, this study shows that users prefer to engage with content that is not overt in its branding, pitch, and advertising. Instagram users also prefer influencers to use the product that is being advertised, rather than to simply share content in an overt advertising format. As the use of native advertising in social media grows, and the number of social media influencers and brands willing to partner with them (as part of their overall marketing strategy)

49

INSTAGRAM, INFLUENCERS, AND NATIVE ADVERTISING: EXAMINING FOLLOWER ENGAGEMENT WITH INFLUENCER CONTENT

continues to rise, this pilot study highlights the need for critically examining consumer engagement with influencer content on Instagram. For influencers, it's important to understand which of their content followers engage with most on a consistent basis and tailor their content to ensure high engagement. For brands, it's important to make an effort to calculate the engagement rates of influencers and their content before choosing to partner with them. Otherwise, a brand may spend significant sums of money without a tangible return. Followers can be readily purchased online, thus, the number of followers means very little in comparison to the engagement rate. An important aspect of this study to consider is the FTC's regulations requiring sponsorship disclosure. These regulations have had the intended effect, as is outlined by this study. The presence of sponsorship disclosure in influencer content results in lower engagement, possibly by triggering consumer ad skepticism. Thus, the FTC's regulations to protect consumers by helping them distinguish between genuine influencer content and sponsored content has worked. However, is the inclusion of #Ad or #Sponsored enough? These hashtags may be considered too subtle. In addition, what prevents an influencer from refusing to disclose their sponsorship or bias with a brand or agency? There currently exist no fines for violating FTC regulations (Federal Trade Commission [FTC], 2017a). This study examined content samples that used eWOM and advertised products subtly. Will the FTC be able to monitor social media

50

networks regularly and enforce its regulations? Without such enforcement and no deterrent, social media influencers may continue to use native advertising and openly advertise products without transparency for the consumer.
